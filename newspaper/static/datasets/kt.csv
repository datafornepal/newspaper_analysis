https://kathmandutribune.com/france-historical-mobilization-and-a-general-strike-against-pension-reform/,"FRANCE- 806 000 angry people marched Thursday against the pension reform throughout the country, according to official figures. A peaceful walk that finished in a few chaotic confrontations, bringing together teacher’s nurses, firemen, postmen, numerous government officials especially from the transport department, and many more, against the future reforms regarding pensions. A spectacular event marking the beginning of an unlimited strike like France hasn’t seen in years.
@bryan_kulka
In order to understand the strike and mobilization, one must first understand how pension work in France. To put it in simple words, professionally active people pay for the retired by contributing a part of their salary, which can go up to 28% if the new system is put in place, to the national found. Once retired, a person earns a specific percentage (based on your years of work and that can go up to 50%) of his 25 best years of payslips. But this system is to be changed by a total of years working, and a system of points linked to the amount of money contributed to the pension found. A system that doesn’t take into account the difficult conditions and environment of some workplaces like having to work at night or use physical strength. Most of the unions concluded that with this system they will work more to earn less and that this system only suits the wealthiest. At stake, there is also the age of departure fixated to 62 years old and the difficulties to leave earlier without facing economic downfalls on their revenue. Numerous other points of discord constitute the reform that ignited what is locally called a “monstrous general and unlimited strike”.
“Justice is dead” 5th December @bryan_kulka
“The anger of the French people has been heard” declared Agnes Buzin, the Minister of Health and Solidarity this morning. It is truly difficult to not hear the 806,000 demonstrators of which 65,000 were in Paris. On their side, the union CGT announced more than 1.5 million protesters throughout France. The country is still stranded as most of its transports continue the strike. Schools are also affected, 30% of them are closed in Paris on the following day.

More than 245 demonstrations were to be expected in France. And in the main cities like Paris, Rennes, Bordeaux, and Toulouse, a lot of them ended in confrontations with police forces. 11,490 police controls and 90 arrests for 71 people in police custody were reported, and this, only in the French capital.

https://kathmandutribune.com/sheena-newman-hits-the-multi-million-dollar-mark-with-pride/,"Ask any entrepreneur, and they will tell you there is nothing quite like the thrill of hitting the multi-million-dollar mark in their net-worth. Financial success is one thing, but positively impacting others is another. That mark represents more than just financial gains. Influencer and entrepreneur Sheena Newman understands this and wears that multi-million-dollar mark with pride. 
At 32-years old, Sheena Newman knows how to run a successful company. Actually, make that a few. With over 12-years of experience in the beauty and fashion industries, Sheena has worked hard to design and deliver products, which her customers love. This has propelled Sheena Newman to the ranks of a multi-millionaire. With beauty and brains to back it up, Sheena received her Bachelor’s degree from UCLA at the young age of 19 and in 2014 earned her MBA from the prestigious Northeastern University.
Passionate about fashion, design, and beauty, Sheena launched her eponymous accessories and cosmetics brand ‘Sheena Sujan’ to huge celebrity acclaim. Coveted by personalities like Demi Lovato, Giuliana Rancic, and Kat Graham, Sheena Sujan saw rapid growth. Inspired by the need for affordable makeup products for the everyday woman Sheena sought to create a business that offered women a service usually reserved for celebrities and influencers. By removing the high-cost barrier of these traditional makeup products and accessories, the brand helped women look and feel their best for any event. 
Not one to stop there, Sheena Newman founded the high-end, clinical-grade, organic skincare company TALIX Organics. Launched in 2019, TALIX Organics creates skincare products, which combine nature with science to deliver the most effective clinical-grade formulations in the industry. Looking for an all-natural skincare solution while she was pregnant with her first child, Sheena worked with clinicians to develop the formula for her popular serum. Newman personally sources the ingredients from around the world to deliver an exceptional product. 
Sheena is proud of the businesses she has built, not only for the monetary success but for the impact she has left on others. Ask Sheena Newman, and she will happily explain that she firmly believes in combining organization and hard-work. With an estimated net worth of $5 million and growing, Sheena makes it look so easy. 
Simply stated, Sheena explains, “I believe the best results come from a carefully executed strategy.” It’s no surprise that her strategy is working. As an influencer, she believes her community deserves the very best, and through her businesses, that is precisely what Sheena Newman delivers.

Caffeine addicts, rejoice. There’s a new addition to the coffee herd. In a market crowded with both indigenous coffee shops and those from different parts of the world, the Choksi brothers, Vardhaman and Rushabh, felt there was space for another and thus was born Cuppa Joe. “We both had this urge to start something creative, like when we started Escobar,” says Vardhaman.

The month-old coffee shop in Mumbai competes with giants such as Café Coffee Day and Costa Coffee next door with unique beverages like butterbeer and marshmallow mocha, along with “fresh food” like pastas and paninis. The newbie also offers choices of soy and skimmed milk and all-day breakfast to its customers.

Speaking on the concept of their venture, Vardhaman said, “With Cuppa Joe, we aim to set an entirely new standard for coffee: fanatic about freshness, unyielding on quality and rooted in community. Cuppa Joe aims to create an experience which is unforgettable, casual yet sophisticated, stylish yet affordable. With 40 percent of the country comprising the youth, we wish to cater to this segment with a cafe that is affordable and provides a wholesome experience. We want Cuppa Joe to be a part of everyone’s day.” With an initial investment of around ₹1 crore, the owners are hoping to achieve operational breakeven in four months. Cuppa Joe or Ordinary Joe? Only time will tell.

https://kathmandutribune.com/need-for-digitalization-in-nepali-banking-industry/,"Generally, the banking system comes up with a requirement for channelizing the fund from surplus unit of the economy to the deficit one in a formal way. The banking system is essential for the promotion of economic activities in the country. It can also be regarded as a meeting point of the customers who want to purchase deposit products and customers who want to purchase lending products. It also helps to increase the money supply in the economy, in turn, has a multiplier effect in the economy.
The main motto of the banking industry is to deliver banking products to the customer in an efficient and effective manner.
Banking service involves a customers’ presence at an outlet to perform transactions. This has compelled the bank and financial institutions (BFIs) to establish a large number of branches across different geographical areas.
In the context of Nepal, BFIs are opening branches across the 753 local levels in order to spread their wings as directed by the central regulatory and monetary authority, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB).  
In fact, Nepali BFIs have been facing difficulties to open their branches in all levels due to the geographical structural diversification, and also due to poor infrastructure development in such areas.
With the geographical diversification in Nepal, implementation of digital banking concept is more appropriate in order to convert the unbanked area into banking one.
In fact, for a country like Nepal, with a literacy rate of 64% and 60% population still without a bank account, it means that financial inclusion about 40%, it is challenging for the regulators and market players to promote digital banking. 
With the emergence of technology, highly competitive and rapidly changing environment, the concept of physical outlets has started to look less relevant. As Bill Gates said in 2008, “banking is essential, but not a bank”. This reflects that the banking system is essential for economy promotion but not physical layouts. 
Due to the use of internet technology has changed the way of doing banking business. Digital banking refers to the process of delivering the various banking products using electronic channels like ATM, Post of Sale (POS), mobile phone, telephone, SWIFT transfer among others. For example, NIC Asia bank has been focusing on the digital banking in Nepal by promoting mobile banking, internet banking, debit card, POS in order to convert the physical banking system into digital one which is essential for the country.
It is clear that anything that creates various opportunities then it is necessary to grab such opportunities we will face lots of challenges. Digital banking has lots of opportunities with challenges. Digital is not a piece of cake. The SWIFT hacking of NIC Asia Bank, theft a number ATMs and recent thefts in E-Sewa increase concerns about the reliability of the digital banking in Nepal. 
In fact, the National Cyber Security Index 2018 ranks Nepal 92th out of 100. This means that Nepal’s ability to prevent cyber threats and manage unintended cyber incidents is poor.
Digitalization in the banking industry is today’s need. It also helps in the promotion of financial literacy and financial inclusion in the rural part of Nepal. Still, people are in remote part need to reach headquarter for the financial services. People still regard digital banking in a complicated procedure.  Although they know all the financial transactions through mobile phones, people hesitate to make use of them.
So as to promote digital banking in Nepal, NRB established a Payment System Department on July 2, 2015, with the sole authority of regulation, supervision, and oversight of the entire payment system in the country. 
In order to promote digital banking in Nepal, first, the government should develop IT-related infrastructure like internet facility, electricity in unbanked areas, then BFIs feel easy to expand their services in those areas, and conduct awareness program among people. Second, BFIs should hire IT expert with sound banking software, empower and train banking employees, maintain sound and efficient internal control system with implementing, monitoring and controlling mechanism in order to provide and ensure reliable digital banking services products to the customers.
With the emergence of digitalization, many organizations have adopted this technology. The future looks optimistic about the move towards a cashless economy.

https://kathmandutribune.com/gurbaksh-chahal-founded-redlotus-is-transforming-customer-service-experience/,"The value of genuine connections cannot be overstated in our digitally driven world. The most successful marketing and advertising campaigns are built through active engagement, one that targets potential customers with the right content at the right time. With the advance of social media and the internet, even the smallest of brands have the opportunity to scale beyond their geographical reach. Companies can target and engage with customers from across the world, such vast scale strategies need to rely on innovative technologies to function efficiently. Companies are looking into the potential of AI, machine learning, blockchain, and automated technology, proving that in the future AI-powered technology is the key to future brand awareness and consumer confidence.
One company, in particular, is always one step ahead of the curve with its unprecedented patent approved technology. RedLotus, founded by Gurbaksh Chahal, has created a software management system which builds user profiles using relevant cloud storage data, analyzing relevant keywords and assigning each profile a weight. Their software offering allows their clients to effectively target customers through proper ad placement, social engagement, and creative content. Alongside this patented software, RedLotus also offers interactive mobile capabilities, enterprise-class software, CRM, and data management. The company is not only a pioneer in the industry but also a one-stop-shop for achieving success in the digital world. 
RedLotus is revolutionizing the customer experience by giving customers a valued connection to brands in real-time. Consumers want to be heard, and spending patterns are often motivated through engagement. The world of advertising is now a two-way conversation, and brands that are listening to their customers are the ones that will succeed. This changing dynamic is shifting customer service into an ongoing conversation, one that begins the moment a customer finds your company, even before a sale has been made. It’s all about starting things off on the right foot.
Chahal saw this trend and soon noticed a need which had to be met, and met quickly. RedLotus offers a kind of technology that identifies patterns in a customer profile while filtering out any irrelevant information, allowing for brand messaging to be targeted, consistent, and concise. It delivers content with more impact. The customer feels noticed and valued from their very first encounter with the brand. As the relationship progresses, RedLotus’ patented technology further collects data and periodically updates the user profile to sustain and power a continued positive customer experience. 
RedLotus isn’t Chahal’s first tech company to attain success. In 2000, Gurbaksh sold his first company, ClickAgents, two years after starting it. Chahal is a well-known tech guru who built three more companies following ClickAgents, including RadiumOne, Gravity4, and BlueLithium, which tracked the behavioral targeting of banner advertising and was acquired by Yahoo! for 300 million dollars. Chahal is also a philanthropist and founded the Chahal Foundation after the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting. Its mission is to prevent hate crimes, support disaster relief, offer scholarships, and improve schools in third world countries. 
RedLotus maintains its headquarters in Hong Kong and has offices in Shanghai, Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Singapore, Taipei, Macao, and Kuala Lumpur. Its innovative data management platform continues to be a driving force in successful and creative marketing strategies worldwide. As trends shift towards AI in data and content management, brands are bound to retain the unique and advanced services of companies like RedLotus.

https://kathmandutribune.com/what-went-into-remodeling-a-socialist-hangout-into-a-coastal-boutique-hotel-reveals-jonathan-riff/,"The large building that houses the Admiral Zaton hotel was likely to be forgotten. Located in the small town of Zaton on the Dalmatian coast of Croatia, it was a social club for Yugoslavian president Josip Broz Tito’s League of Communists. In the years since Yugoslavia’s dissolution though, it became a shadow of its former self. Today, it is a sophisticated boutique hotel with a subtly rustic yet refined décor.
That dramatic transformation is the work of young entrepreneur and developer Jonathan Riff. In a YouTube video chronicling the transformation of the Zaton, he revealed that he first visited Croatia in 2006, when he was just nineteen. “I just fell in love with the place and it left an impression on my mind,” he said. Ten years later, he and his fiancé, high-end hotel designer Megan Horney, packed up their dog and as many of their belongings as they could and flew from Los Angeles to Croatia with the intent of starting a business. 
Zaton hadn’t even been on the list of places to consider. With a population of barely 850, it was easy to overlook. But its picturesque views of vivid blue ocean waters and nearness to Bibich Winery made it irresistible. When they found out that Zaton had no hotel accommodations, the idea began to take shape. 
They hired local contractors and tradesmen. Megan did the designs for renovations. Both of them wanted to source everything they could locally, or at least from within Croatia. The old club had been sitting unused for many years, and the sings were there for all to see: peeling paint, damaged floors, old cushions and detached toilets that had been piled up and abandoned. Over the course of the next five months, and despite the language gap between the couple and their new Croatian friends, the building began to look more and more like a hotel.
Not that there weren’t challenges. The original plan was for Admiral Zaton to feature a full-service restaurant and bar. But finding the time and resources to make that happen proved difficult. During the first season of the hotel’s business, Megan and Jonathan weren’t able to open the restaurant. One of the most challenging parts of this was finding a chef, and during the second season, they found not only one but two!
“It took nearly a month to test and decide on a menu,” says Jonathan. “I would suggest something and the chefs would just stare at me in disbelief. This went on for a few days before they gave into trying my ideas. Step by step, we narrowed down our selection by bouncing ideas off each other, and even tried to put a Californian twist on some local favorites.” By the second season, Konoba Kalifornija was open. 
This collision, this bringing together of two different histories and cultures, seems to sum up the whole Admiral Zaton experience. The rooms are open and airy; windows allow for sunlight to bounce off of vivid blues. There are a distinct old-world charm and a hint of Californian minimalism.
In the end, it all paid off. As word started to spread, reservations started to come in. Going into their fourth season, the Admiral Zaton is frequently booked solid. Guests like what they see and experience. “I think, through all of it, one of the things that made it, for me personally, that made it all worth it was when we actually confirmed the booking of our first guest. When they arrived, after all that effort, it was the most rewarding feeling I have ever felt.”

https://kathmandutribune.com/hassan-al-mannai-a-former-banker-redefining-the-equestrian-industry/,"The key to living a happy life is by following your passion. You might be qualified and trained for one profession, but if your heart lies in a different field, it’s always best to follow suit. The same happened in the case of Hassan Al Mannai. He started out in the finance industry and is now making waves in the equestrian industry.
Hassan was all of three years old when he first came in contact with horses. As a child, he enjoyed horse-riding with his father and the rest of his family. As Hassan grew older, he realized that his passion for horses wasn’t just a phase and that it was here to stay. As he grew into early adulthood, he continued horse-riding and his interest and passion for the Arabian horse multiplied. The Arabian horse breed garnered his full attention once he started attending horse shows globally and began gaining more knowledge about them.
While one can say that Hassan was always destined to work in the equestrian industry, not many know that he was originally a banker by profession. When he started his career, Hassan worked in the banking sector in various capacities such as a relationship officer and senior relationship manager. While he continued to work in the field of finance, his heart always belonged to the horses. While he pursued his banking job, he kept improving his knowledge about the equestrian industry by surrounding himself with horse owners and breeders. 
Hassan finally made his foray into the equestrian industry in 2013. In 2014, he had founded and built his own stud, called the Al Reeh and owned his own breeding program. Al Reeh is situated in the heart of Qatar and specializes in breeding high-quality Arabian horses with a capacity of more than 40 horses. Al Reeh has built a commendable reputation as it has obtained several medals in both national and international competitions. 
However, Hassan didn’t stop there as he wanted to take his passion for horses to new heights. In 2017, he successfully became the representative for Qatar as a judge at national and international competitions covering Qatar, Italy, Denmark, and Russia. In early 2018, Hassan achieved yet another milestone. He was appointed as the Director of Show at the Qatar Racing and Equestrian Club. The club is recognized as a member of ECAHO since 1994 and Qatar is the first non-European country member in ECAHO. The club has successfully organized five shows, out of which two were international. In 2018, Hassan organized a national show with the largest number of registrations ever recorded with over 350 horses participating. Hassan has also organized an Arabian horse auction, which took place at the end of 2018. The auction saw 80 plus horses in attendance and all of them were sold successfully. 
A proud member of the equestrian industry, Hassan hopes to scale new heights in the years to come. He aims to do so by developing his knowledge, skills, and network within the industry. Hassan also wants to promote Qatar as a world hub for the Arabian Horse Show and a leader in the pure Arabian breed.

https://kathmandutribune.com/david-edward-carpenter-credits-having-the-right-mentor/,"Some people take a lifetime to build their career, some do it in a matter of months. In this fast-paced world, working smart is just as important as working hard, and millennials are realizing it. With a plethora of career options available to youngsters, it isn’t easy to find your calling. Having a mentor can make a world of a difference, just as it did for David Carpenter. 
Carpenter credits his early success to his mentors who have guided him in the right direction and helped him become the person he is today. “I have great mentors that have shown me the way and how to build my career quickly and effectively. I wanted to build a sales force and take over the industry. I had the opportunity to partner with the number one agency in the company and it has been an amazing journey” said Carpenter. 
David Edward Carpenter was born and brought up in Phoenix, Arizona. Carpenter went to Piedmont Virginia Community College and dropped out in a year. Very early in his life he got into network marketing and realized he was good at it. He worked his way to the top and became a platinum level distributor. In 2014, he led a team of 200, to millions of dollars in sales.
David witnessed many of his ventures fail, and thus he turned to his mentor once again, who urged him to explore the financial services industry. David realized that he could use his skills to sell something he believed in. “I wanted to help people. I believed in the product of protecting families and American Income Life Insurance had so much growth potential,” said Carpenter. So, in 2017 he got into the financial services industry. In a span of a few months, he outshined company veterans and steadily rose to the very top.
In just four months of starting out, Carpenter was promoted to upper management and in eight months he was the regional manager. With his guidance, his team made a whopping $289,000 income in 2017 and with that, Carpenter became the first employee in the history of the company to be promoted to the Board of Directors in such a short time.
Apart from finding personal success, he has also helped many other people succeed in their careers. He opened the company’s first office in Tempe, Arizona in 2018 which also won the office of the year. He also opened the El Paso office where he promoted over 50 managers. Thanks to Carpenter, the company witnessed a 236% growth from 2017 to 2018. Carpenter has also helped build the reputation of the company by leading his entire agency to win the agency of the year award.
David Carpenter has had a widely successful journey and none of it would have been possible, had he not received crucial assistance from his mentors. They helped him find his passion and in turn played a pivotal role in creating one of the most widely respected frontmen in the financial services industry today.

https://kathmandutribune.com/making-money-through-building-brands-by-sam-jacobs/,"The advent of Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence displacing functions and 5G on the anvil leads us to one pertinent question on everyone’s mind; “how to make money through the brand building?” Timely innovation is healthy but given the rapid pace of advancement coupled with ever-rising customer expectations, you realize that it’s not so simple. The challenge of making money and building your customer base remains, so let’s look at how you can emerge a winner. 
Every board room has a naysayer who believes that spending on the brand building should not take precedence over other spends that generate instant revenue. Brand building requires money and doesn’t promise immediate returns, nor you can measure its impact on a scale. But if this mindset drives your product strategy, be prepared for fleeting success until you get swept away by your competitors who may slowly but surely build recall, trust and enhance equity of their brands.    
From visiting a theme park to buying a pair of shoes to having a cup of coffee, such routine chores are catapulted to a moment of unmatched pleasure simply because of the ‘brand value’ each brand brings to the table. Making money isn’t an overnight process and neither is brand building. When your brand equity starts taking shape, your brand’s reach increases organically, and this induces new trials, fosters loyalty and builds a solid foundation. Almost all leading global brands have faced a ‘crisis’, whether it was product recalls or poor working conditions and at those watershed moments, it was the investment they made in ‘brand building’ over the years that kept them afloat and keeps them going strong even today. That’s why you can make far more money through the brand building than through R&D, through innovation and through even patents. 
The beauty of the brand building is that you can only make a real difference if you remain true to your brand. Following the herd when it comes to advertising campaigns will only fuel your competitors’ progress. Instead, you should carve your own identity and treat your brand as a separate entity. Based on this approach, you should invest in at least one standalone brand building activity year-on-year until you reach a stage where you start reaping benefits through organic revenues. When it becomes synonymous with your brand is when you can sit back and be sure to see an uptick in revenues or in other words experience the phenomenon of ‘making money through brand building’.
Flaunting and self-consciousness are at peak levels and only rising. Everyone is concerned about ‘that picture they take below the Eiffel Tower’ and the magnitude of the response to their props and poses. A counselor would lament at this but there’s no better time and place to be a brand. Making money through brand building here could mean investing in an activity that makes your brand a partner in your consumer’s journey of self-discovery, of achievements, of chasing their dreams or simply giving them a platform to express themselves. To conclude, your brand’s loyalty quotient goes up by notches and results in your brand making good money.

https://kathmandutribune.com/the-modern-ad-guru-how-manish-bardia-built-his-brand/,"To create advertisements that are engaging and inducing is an enigma, just as much as an art form is. It becomes far more challenging in a land of over a billion people where there exists a multitude of cultures with different ideologies. What is needed here is an immaculate approach that focuses on communicating the concept of the campaign to the audiences in all its essence. There are only a handful few in the advertising world who have the ingenuity of pulling this off with great finesse, and Manish Bardia is one of them.
Hailing originally from Sardar Shehar in Rajasthan, Bardia finished his commercial art course in 1990 from the C.N. Institute of Fine Arts in Ahmedabad. He moved to Mumbai shortly thereafter to work for ad agencies, but just after a year, Bardia decided to take the entrepreneurial path and launched his own company. He moved back to Ahmedabad and founded the Moving Pixels Company, a production house that started out of limited space.
During the first few years, the company worked on advertising campaigns for corporates and local cable networks. Amid the process of building an impressive clientele in the 2000s, Manish’s work was noticed by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Soon, he was contacted by the ISRO to work on a project highlighting the PSLV launch. That recognition propelled the Moving Pixels Company to new heights in every sense of the word.
Bardia also worked with the Gujarat Government on various campaigns, highlighting the ethos, culture, and tourism in the state. It led to a fruitful partnership that has lasted for well over 10 years during which, Bardia made use of his filmmaking skills and creativity to produce some of the most remarkable ad campaigns.
The Ahmedabad-based company got the ball rolling by introducing the locals to the Jyotigram Yojana, in addition to the Vibrant Gujarat 2007 summit. Following the massive success there, Bardia soon moved on to work with Gujarat Tourism Development Corporation on a social media campaign ‘Come Back to Life, Come to Gujarat’, emphasizing the vibrancy of tourist destinations in Gujarat. The campaign led to a substantial increase in the growth of tourism in the state, thereby attaining widespread appreciation and attention. Besides this, Manish has also worked on other campaigns like ‘Chalo India’ and ‘Chalo Gujarat’ on an international scale.
It is fair to say that the height of his success knows no bounds. Back in 2015, when Mr. Narendra Modi visited the Wembley Stadium to meet David Cameron, the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the meeting was well-received by spectators across the globe. In addition to the Modi’s inspiring speech, the eye-striking multimedia spectacle with spirited, dynamic energies simply wooed the people. It was Bardia’s creativity and his team’s efforts that made the event a resounding success.
Over the course of his 25-year stint in the advertising industry, Bardia has worked with some of the corporate giants as well. His portfolio boasts of some big names like Reliance owned ‘Only Vimal’, Rasna, Hipolin, Forever Jewellery, among others. He has also worked on the ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ alongside Shilpa Shetty. 
Bardia’s ability to strike an emotional chord with the audiences led him to work on Government advertisements – most notably, Aadhaar Card, BHIM app, GST, and other similar schemes. Needless to mention, Bardia has truly mastered the art of communicating impactful ideas to the people. With an ever-growing portfolio of astonishing projects, it will be interesting to see what Manish Bardia achieves next.

https://kathmandutribune.com/why-nepal-needs-free-press/,"Nepal like any democratic country needs a strong free press. The 2015 constitution gave hope to press in this young federal democratic nation that the media was powerful enough to make leaders and politicians accountable for their action. The new Muluki Ain Criminal code 2074 (Article 293) tries to seize that power from the press.
The new provisions are under scrutiny since it devalues the worth of a free press. What the Nepal government needs to do is help in fostering a free, strong press. And not try to gag it. If the foundation of the fourth pillar is no more, how will this nation as a democratic institution live on? Anarchy seems to be on the horizon.
Investigative journalism is at the heart of a free press. The western media have countless accounts of making institutions and leaders accountable by publishing news on #MeToo, Offshore scandals, et cetera. In the new age, whistleblowers have played a key role and the new law discourages every aspect of investigative journalism: recording conversations, taking photos secretly, and obtaining documents (information). We as a democratic country cannot function if investigative journalism is trampled.
Fake news and sensationalism media have tightened its grip on Nepali media and society. In this grave hour, we as a society need a free press that publishes fair news and at the same time keeps the government on its toes. Or are we at the age where we don’t need newspapers? Is the government pushing for a regulated press? We are strongly against it.
A free press is not idealism but the blood of a functioning, democratic society. Nepal still suffers from corruption, sexism, crimes, inequality, and the list goes on…Isn’t this the role of a free press to stand up and speak for the people? To silence a free press is to not allow people to speak their mind.

Nepal government should reconsider its stance on free press and journalism. It also should uplift the Article 19 of the Constitution and reinstate the right to communication. A few lawmakers believe the provisions are open to interpretation and that’s exactly why press in Nepal is troubled. We are not sure how the government will act against media in coming days. Does the Nepal government feel that a free press is not the need of the hour?


We are responding to the call of The Boston Globe and though we are miles apart it is the values that we adhere. A true democracy needs a vibrant and free press. That’s what we stand for. Censorship has been used over the years by the quasi-democratic regime to continue their rule. Are we heading to that model and direction? If so, we see a dark future for a free press in Nepal. And no one wants that.


This is the exact reason why you need to support an independent media like Kathmandu Tribune. We’re moving ahead despite financial difficulties and aim to report what you need to hear and not what you should hear. This is our stand. Are you with us?

https://kathmandutribune.com/to-tax-or-not-to-tax/,"
Nepal government recently implemented a 13% tax on Internet services and 23% tax on liquor industries. These two tax regimes are just an example but the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) government has decided to tax Nepali people whether they like it or not. And why is so?


 


The government is penniless. It’s broke. The haphazard spending during the Asar (June-July) month before the new fiscal year gave no new shock to Nepalis who are used to the usual misfits by faltering politicians. What more can be true than a new presumed stable government not heeding to its promises? Several critics, in the past, did argue that federalism is never going to work in Nepal. It can definitely work and the government is exactly doing that. If it wants to tax Nepalis then fine but will it prove to 28 million people that it will in return invest the tax money, effectively? Time will only tell us. 


 


Five months is not enough to judge a democratic government. And this is why a stable government that lasts four to five years is essential, both for the nation’s young democracy and for the causes of development activities. PM K.P. Oli had expressed his discontentment in the past that he couldn’t do much because he was kicked out of the office after nine months. This is the time he needs to prove: how will he perform in the four-five years? Or even two years? 


 


It is understandable that the Nepal government and the new finance minister wants to tax people and sustain federalism. The joy of celebrating decentralization in Nepal is a powerful statement of ordinary Nepalis and it can only translate into a fruitful victory if the seven provinces can march ahead. 


 


The argument of being lynched between China and India is now an old-school verbatim. Nepal should go ahead that rhetoric and try to reshape its own foreign and national policy. What’s the new policy of Nepal for taxing people? Can we witness an economic boom and improvement in our development indexes? While talking to several fellow countrymen, they had a similar argument that if the government can improve our lifestyle, it is okay to tax them. This clearly suggests that Nepali people want progress and development–with or without tax. 


 


The question now is: what will the Nepal government do with the tax money? And will it continue the tradition of spending the budget in the dreaded Asar month? We can only speculate, wait and watch, and evaluate the government’s performances in the coming days. 


 


What’s the way forward for the Nepal government? They should tax on carbon-emitting vehicles and promote electric and mass transit. The government should utilize the collected tax properly sans corruption. And the derogatory tradition of spending budget in Asar month should come to an end. Tax regime should be transparent and free from corrupt people. Also, will Nepalis get tax returns like in the western nations? Only then Nepalis will freely oblige to be taxed and not say anything. However, it is the embedded culture in Nepali society to not say anything but time will only tell if there’s another revolution waiting.

https://kathmandutribune.com/100-days-of-oli/,"Prime Minister K.P. Oli’s 100 days of tenure has come to an end. What comes as a surprise to many is his bombastic talk and not doing the walk. This is not unusual, however, to those who are critics of Oli.
The first criticism against Oli is his changed stance against India and the Indian PM Modi. During the latter’s visit, Oli tactically avoided bringing up the 2015 blockade issue. Critics believe that Oli treaded on the delicate Nepal-India relations cautiously since the so-called ‘special relationship’ has nosedived. And it was obvious that common Nepalis weren’t in the mood to welcome the south block PM.
But did PM Oli really fail? The second criticism is the developmental process. When the UML party won the elections promising ‘progress and development’ Nepalis were elated. After 100 days of Oli’s reign in Nepal, the real progress is yet to be seen. It is imperative to not forget that Nepal is now load-shedding free.
The third criticism is how the central government failed to handle the Province 2 fiasco. As Indian PM Modi was addressing the masses in Janakpur, Province 2 CM Raut vehemently spoke against Nepal’s constitution and tried to win the favor of Modi. The flag of Nepal placed in the event too wasn’t the right one. Most importantly, Nepali media were barred from having a close interaction with the Indian PM Modi. This move by the Oli-led government received a strong backlash from the state’s fourth organ.
Should Oli be credited for the newly formed Nepal Communist Party? It is apparent that he was more concerned about his party’s longevity than working for the common good. This plan, however, might work out for him and the NCP as the communist party appears to rule Nepal for the next five years. Oli has got the king and queen for now. What needs to be seen is if he does the walk the talk henceforth.

https://kathmandutribune.com/respect-nepali-media-nepal-government/,"The recent visit by Indian PM Narendra Modi on May 11 and 12 saw a new low for Nepali media. At a time when press freedom in Nepal is going down, such tactful move by the Nepal government to systematically bar Nepali media from covering Modi’s civic reception and Muktinath visit is unconstitutional and violates the rights of Nepali media.
It was reported that Nepali media were barred in two instances. First, they were not allowed to take pictures of Modi at the Muktinath temple whereas Indian state-owned medias were readily allowed. The so-called Indian security were actively barring Nepali journalists from reaching Modi whereas Nepali security personnel looked haplessly. Second, when Modi gave his [un] civic reception at Rastriya Sabha Griha then Nepali journalists were kept out of the building while the Indian PM Modi’s vehicle drove past them. Both incidents reflect the attitude of Modi and Oli towards the press. One cannot say that they are leading two democratic South Asian countries. This cannot be true.
A state actors viewpoint and treatment towards a free press reflects his/her position on the issue of democratic norms. What can a nation achieve if the state actors ‘agree’ to avoid journalists that would ask hard questions? This is not a democracy, not in the eyes of a free Nepali and Indian press. Both governments should reflect, change their course, and give due respect to the fourth organ of the state.

But who cares? Nepal is a republic and the most powerful person can do anything she wants. The ride brought the memory to some of us who had witnessed the march of the monarchs in the past. This new king’s march is a mockery of the spirit of the new federal, Republic of Nepal. Oh well, we forgot that Nepali people are still powerless and can’t scream: Hello President, do you even lift?
No, the President the new king doesn’t lift. She doesn’t care about the state of Nepali women. Some Nepalis wittily proposed that the President was inspired by Priyanka Karki and here recent ride. We got no confirmation about this.
Such hullabaloo can only be seen in a country where numerous manticores dance and shake their souls to the throne of power. Our expectations from the President is dead. Or will she prove us wrong this April 1st?

https://kathmandutribune.com/editorial-european-union-wants-to-destabilize-nepal/,"The final report published by the European Union Election Observation Mission has made it clear that it is against Khas-Arya quota in Nepal. This issue has already been settled under the Constitution of Nepal, and such defamatory comment only exposes European Union’s real interest in Nepal. It wants to destabilize Nepal by creating conflict among its people and rob the much-achieved stability and peace.
EUEOM misses the fact that not all Khas-Arya are rich and doing well in Nepal. Few marginal groups are better off. Such progressive and intellectual institution missing out that point deliberately suggests that EU doesn’t have good intentions for Nepal. It is no wonder that EU has been accused of instigating social experiments like spreading Christianity, promoting federalism, and going against the monarchy. Some experts argue that EU doesn’t want to see Nepal progressing and becoming stable due to its Communism-leaning and to make sure that South Asia region in whole doesn’t become stable and outdo the EU.
European Union is already pro-India as they met in Brussels during the blockade imposed by the latter. Both had agreed that there were flaws in Nepal’s constitution. What right gives the EU and India to meet in a foreign nation and decide over a cup of tea about another country’s constitution and sovereignty?
The final report clearly states that the longer EU institutions stay in Nepal, it will pose a threat to Nepal’s sovereignty. The current PM K.P. Oli should talk with his advisors and make a decision that institutions like EUEOM won’t be invited to Nepal again for observing the election. On the other hand, the other comments and recommendations they have made like the transparency of the Election Commission are laudable. But the EU’s support for secessionist CK Raut and the desire to create conflict in Nepal by going against Khas-Arya population is a dangerous threat to Nepal’s sovereignty. Nepal’s current government must act immediately before its too late.

https://kathmandutribune.com/deubanomics-olinomics-is-nepal-falling-apart/,"Nepal will have a new leftist government in the month of February. But the outgoing PM Deuba is jumping on the bandwagon of populism, passing controversial policies and making decisions which are not democratic. Nepalis are haplessly witnessing Deubanomics: a so-called democratic party is making sure that the new government will inherit an unstable state economy. If political instability is seeming to be a thing of past in Nepal, economic uncertainty seems to be the new political card for Nepali politicians.
The controversial decision by Deuba on pension age is baffling. One can be 65 and receive old age allowance. Deuba didn’t decide to do it out of love for people, but, the Congress party simply wanted to make sure that the new Leftist government would hit the ax on its own legs. Is this even a democratic spirit? There’re voices among the public that post-Girija Prasad Koirala, Nepali Congress (NC)  is suffering from a leadership crisis. More than that the recent polls proved that NC lacks a working ideology too. Hence, they have sought for the populism card, which the Leftist Coalition had used it effectively in the recently completed elections. Are we witnessing a new wave of populism in Nepal? Nepalis are skeptical whether the new government will be able to handle the mess created by NC or not.
A caretaker government shouldn’t make policies, which, will be overturned by the new govt. The impulsive decision made by the NC will not only put a burden on Nepal’s economy, it might rob the faith and hope of Nepalis too. This is purely political tactics by the NC knowing that CPN-UML and Maoist-Center resort to the populism card. It will be interesting to see as how the Leftist govt reacts in coming days.
K.P. Oli seems to fare well in terms of populist agenda but his recent mark about ‘underground money’ is surprising. There’s fear that ‘black money’ will increase under the Leftist govt. Olinomics might fail if Oli goes ahead without consulting with former NRB chief Yubaraj Khatiwada. If Nepal government, either present or upcoming, continues to juggle the populism card, then the talk about the nation developing economically will only remain in papers. It won’t be a surprise if Nepal becomes the next Greece or Venezuela. Nepali banks are under serious pressure and federalism will be expensive. Is Nepal’s economy falling apart?

https://kathmandutribune.com/nepali-politicians-healthcare-system/,"The tradition of Nepali politicians going abroad for medical checkup hasn’t come to an end. This is disheartening at a time when poor Nepalis are dying from cold and other diseases. The recent announcement of UML chief K.P. Oli has come under scrutiny as the formation of the new government looks unlikely for a month or so. The criticism has indeed raised a number of questions yet again. Isn’t Nepal’s health system good enough for all?
Nepali politicians, time and again, have fooled Nepalis who have trusted and voted them. This is evident in the healthcare system too. Nepal’s healthcare system is broken and appears to be out-of-reach for the poor ones. It is an expensive one too. If not expansive–reaching to all, it cannot remain exclusive. Should politicians only enjoy a proper healthcare system while the poor and weary die from sickness?
There’s argument in Nepali political sphere that power equals foreign medical tour. But power doesn’t equal responsibility or ethics. It is no doubt that if a leader in Nepal cannot get a proper treatment then foreign countries is an option. Because simply put it’s possible. There are no alternatives or options for a poor person. Sometimes the only way out is a shaman or a religious exorcist. The Nepali Politician will never visit such avenues. They only do when they want to be assured of their future.
Nepal’s healthcare system needs an overhaul. Nepalis have voted their favorites this time and it’s up to them to be true to their words. Can Nepali politicians fix the broken healthcare system for all and for them too? We hope to read a headline soon that Nepali politicians no longer seek foreign trip for a medical checkup.

https://kathmandutribune.com/nepal-police-respect-press-freedom/,"Nepal Police recently asked five editors of online news portals to reveal their sources, ordered to track their phones, and check the call history. This is clearly an overstepping of the Metropolitan Police force and blatant attack on press freedom.
It is a known fact that press is one of the pillars of a vibrant democracy and if the news published by the five news outlets is not satisfactory then it’s the duty of the Press Council Nepal and Ministry of Communications to deal with it. It is not the duty of Nepal Police to dictate news outlets to reveal the sources. This shows the attitude of Nepal Police towards Nepali Press and it is unfortunate.
Nepal Police should be reminded that in a democracy there are checks and balances and a free, vibrant press is needed to uphold the values of democracy. And yet we cannot deny that fake news and sensationalist articles flood the media space in Nepal, but it is definitely not the duty of Nepal Police to rectify the problem. On the other hand, Press Council and media unions of Nepal have failed to contain fake and sensationalism news. We need regulations from the latter.

https://kathmandutribune.com/chinese-ngo-provides-training-to-nepali-youths/,"KATHMANDU — The six-month-long training program on the computer and Chinese language formally concluded in Kathmandu on Monday under the initiative of a Chinese NGO.
The project entitled “Enable Nepalese youths for life skill development through basic and advanced computer training” was conducted by China’s Tibet based organization Good Will Foundation. 
The project was implemented by the Nepali partner organization Samajik Rupantaran Nepal. At least 20 unemployed youths, particularly from rural areas, attended the training program carried out from July to December last year in Bhaktapur. 
The closing and certificate distribution ceremony was organized in Kathmandu on Monday amid the presence of officials, stakeholders, and participants. 
Addressing the event, Laxmi Sundar Awale, a representative from the District Coordination Committee office, remarked that such training programs are important for the career building of Nepali youths.
A representative of the Good Will Foundation said that the project aimed to enable Nepali youths to learn a new skill that could support their professional careers.  
According to Samajik Rupantaran Nepal, this was the third phase of the computer training program for Nepali youths. This time, the youths were also provided with the basic Chinese language course, who also appeared in HSK tests. 
Karishma Shrestha, Secretary at Samajik Rupantaran Nepal, informed that many youths have already received job opportunities in course of the training programs. 
Besides certificates, two outstanding students from the group were also awarded a laptop to assist their education and work.     
The Chinese organization has been supporting various areas like health, education and skill development of youths and women in Nepal.

https://kathmandutribune.com/urgency-of-social-science-research-council-in-nepal/,"Saurav Raj Pant 
The common tendency of the global south is that it has very less investment in research and development works as it is often occupied in dealing with food and shelter. According to the World Bank, Nepal’s research budget was 0.054% out of total GDP in 2008 which slightly increased to 0.302% by2010 which reflects the priority of the government of Nepal. Social Science in Nepal is a less ‘charmed’ subject. Majority of Nepalese seek employment abroad, while the rest choose corporate or private business along with government duties. Very few people choose to pursue their career in the field related to social sciences. According to the World Bank 2008 data, only 15.26% are employed in the service sectors. Nepal is an agricultural country with hyper rural settings. Mostly 80% of Nepali lands are rural and agriculture is the lifeline, however, the boom of the NGOs/INGOs in Nepal has created a few surpluses for the social science students The emerging cities of Nepal resembles the flourishing capitalism as the agriculture lands are converting into real estate ‘money producing’ engines. Some of the veteran sociologists in Nepal claim that Nepal is already under the capitalist mode of production but the traits of feudal, agriculture and capitalist are seen in Nepali society. Ironically, the Government of Nepal hires foreign experts in doing any macro research in Nepal with handsome payments while Nepali human resources remain unemployed often lacking skills to conduct such researches.
Can we think?
Though Research &Development (R&D) is not strictly associated with social sciences but there has been a huge crisis of R&D of Nepal even in general. This brings forth as a reminder of a famous saying of Kishore Mahbubani ‘Can Asians think’? Is Nepal thinking these days? It is hard to say. Nepal’s upbringing is purely traditional and lacks a rational approach often failing to see from a wider perspective. This gap has made Nepali inefficient and resembles the traditional and theological approach in every day to day life. The existing research institutions in Nepal like Nepal Academy of Science & Technology for Natural science, Institute for International Affairs, Nepal Agricultural Research Council and Center For Nepal and South Asian Studies are some of the handful names working for the research and development in their respective subjects. In this hyper globalized world, human development assets are preliminary to achieve any kinds of multi-lateral growth in the country. In the Western world, there has been a huge priority for social science development. Most of the American youth studies liberal arts to learn about the history, arts, culture, geography of the world and ultimately ruling the world. It’s the knowledge of the then Europe who saw the importance of history, arts, geography that helped them to push into the age of exploration which in return led to the apex of human civilization. According to  Pew Research Center, most of the American youth graduates are more politically liberal due to changing political circumstances 7% of the post-graduates youth in 1994 are ‘consistently liberal’ whereas in current time 31% of people with post-grad education are consistently liberal. R&D contributes to more politically liberal attitudes of people. This somehow makes society more stable and chaos in the society is minimized. However, Nepal seems to be oblivious to the importance of R& D as no significant investment or efforts can be seen to have been made to develop research culture in Nepal. 
Way forward
Strategy & formerly known as Booz & Company, the US-based consultancy firm say, Health care and computers accounted for half of all R&D investment. In 2013, Volkswagen invested 5.2% of its revenue in R&D. According to the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), the majority of the R&D of the Multinational companies are done in the US located business. $279 billion was invested by the US located business in the R&D in 2010.  Mostly R&D in the US and Europe are done by hiring scientist or being affiliated with the research council. 
Underlining it in Nepal, due to the lack of robust research council in Nepal, Government of Nepal relies on the reports prepared by the UNDP (For Human Development Index), World Bank (For Economic growth) Amnesty International (For Human Rights issues), and Transparency International (For corruption issues).  This makes Nepali government working modality totally de-technical and incapable of handling the socio-economic and political challenges that come across in the absence of social research. 
In Europe, the need for social research has been felt from the very beginning. In universities of Europe, it started teaching various international subjects via establishing the research departments. Such departments include African Studies, Oriental Studies, Middle East Studies, South Asian studies. Due to the lack of proper vivid Master Degree (which is only oriented to the certificate), Nepali students are moving abroad to study regional discipline in Europe and the USA. So, it is somehow shameful for Nepal students to study about their regional dynamics in abroad because we lack research ingredients. 
There is no independent policy environment for academic, students and activist to do independent research in Nepal.  For doing in social research in Nepal, either one has to rely on the University Grant Commission (UGC) or within the funding framework of the INGOs or Development aid agencies as an NGO worker—–that is solely regulated by the Social Welfare Council. Unfortunately, international development partners have priority only in the community development works not on primarily the research & development work.  Generally, International development agencies focus on the Baseline and End line research of specific project not on the issues. They believe themselves as humanitarian agents and deals with basic priorities of the vulnerable people. Most of the research institutions in Nepal are heavily politicized and outcome that would bring is still under big doubt for the community.  
This brings the urgent need of independent and powerful social science research council in Nepal.  The possible function of such research council would be analyzing the world-changing demographics, ethnic and religious dynamics. It is the lack of social research that in most cases sparks the war and ethnic cleansing. It also will provide policy direction for the regulation, promotion, implementation, and management. More significantly, it will help for knowledge generation and management. It will also publish and publicize the research content at the national and international level. Further, it will coordinate with various foreign research agencies to carry out a joint research project. The proposed council can be run by the veteran sociologist of Nepal where government ensures the provision of the budget for its work.  This research council in long run encourages the habit of doing research among students and young scholars. It would even be better if we can propose such research council in a federal model since we are quickly moving to it. In such a proposed institution, young students can come to do an internship so as to sharpen their research skills. 
The two rising giants’ neighbors of Nepal i.e India and China seems to have realized the importance of investing in R&D very early in comparison to ourselves. According to a WB report, the total expenditure of India out of GDP on R&D is 0.82 in 2011 which arose from 0.63 in 1996 whereas China’s total expenditure on R&D is 2.05% comparing to the 0.57 % in 1996. India and China both have powerful and Independent social research council to facilitate the R&D.
Under such crucial juncture, it is the responsibility and duties of every social science workers like us to demand a powerful and autonomous Social research council in Nepal, which would be responsible to look after institutions that are solely dedicated to social science researches rather than NGOs and private companies. Such council should be devoted in facilitating and managing academic and non –academic research in the field of social science. However, establishing the council and providing it the jurisdiction to regulate researches is not sufficient to enable our Nepalese researchers to compete with the world. A proper provision of funding and other technical support should also be provided, and the beneficiaries should not be limited to universities and NGOs but be extended to all existing and aspiring research organizations. Development of anything depends on the holistic understanding and knowledge of the subject, and a proper provision of social science research will provide an insight beyond the normal perception which can lead not only to economic, and political progress but usher in a desirable social change altogether.

Over 62000 students have received NOC till May 24 which is almost double in FY 2015-16, 32,489. This means more students are going abroad for further studies. Nepali students choose Australia, America, Japan, China, and the USA for higher studies.


 


Is foreign studies a good indicator for the sustainable economic prosperity?


 


Education level is an indicator for the economic development of the country. Educated citizens lead the nation to the path of economic prosperity.


 


Nepali students leaveing abroad for education take their capital too. This wealth is often an investment for the country. 


 


But, after the completion of their higher education, it is unsure whether they return or not. Moreover, Nepal should create a robust plan and policies to motivate Nepali students to return. Then finally they will become assets for the country otherwise become liabilities for Nepal.


 


The Endogenous Growth Model states that a country can develop if it has made an investment in human capital formation, research, and development. 


 


It also explains that the quality of human resources reflects in the productivity and economic growth. There is a positive spillover effect of knowledge which helps to improve the efficiency of the economy in long- run.


 


From my perspective students going abroad doesn’t reflect negative light. But, the qualified students must return home for the development of the country. 


 


Many professors say that ‘mobility of students’ is positive. It provides an opportunity to get out, and learn new skills. Foreign education will also help students to think in a new way. But they must return to the country after completion of their higher education.


 


Nepalis must use their skills, knowledge, and abilities to develop the nation. It is a bad situation if students are leaving Nepal due to lack of trust in Nepali education.


 


Investment in education is the foundation for the development of the country. The country should provide a budget to the education sector. The government should focus in producing qualified, skillful human capital. This will help Nepal in achieving economic prosperity in the long run.


 


Nepal faces a shortage of human capital. And, Nepali youths are leaving the country for foreign employment. The country is unable to balance between demand and supply of human resources. 


 


In fact, the country doesn’t have any national level human resource department. It is almost impossible to handle the availability of human capital in the country.


 


There is a high risk if Nepali student goes abroad at a younger age, and stay in foreign land forever. So, the country should create a suitable environment for them. And attract to return and use them as assets for the development of the nation.

Amid a function organized in Lokanthali of Bhaktapur today, the youths were provided with certificates by the representatives of the Chinese organization and officials of the Chinese embassy in Nepal.

https://kathmandutribune.com/why-nepal-needs-a-central-research-laboratory/,"National development of any nation is impossible without research activities in the field of science and technology. Our neighboring countries have reached as the powerful nations with the help of science and technology through research activities in higher education institutions whereas our country Nepal is far behind.
 We have Kathmandu University, Tribhuvan University, Pokhara University, Purbanchal University, Far-western University, Lumbini Bouddha University, Mid-western University, Agriculture, and Forestry University, Nepal Sanskrit University and Nepal Open University for higher education. These institutions offer at least four years Bachelor degrees, Master, and Doctoral degrees. Among them, Tribhuvan University and Kathmandu University have more interest in the research-oriented education system in the field of science and technology. 
Tribhuvan University is the Government University and ranks number 11 in the World according to the enrollment of students. But there is no good quality education because there are more teaching activities rather than research oriented activities practically whereas Kathmandu University has less number of students but there is a better quality of education in comparison with Tribhuvan University. The fee structure of Kathmandu University is more than Tribhuvan University. Most of the students of Nepal are economically and socially backward. The majority of them are not able to afford the higher education in private institutions and aboard.
Recently, Tribhuvan University launched the semester system which improves the education system slowly but in order to enhance the national development one needs to have the research-oriented education system. In terms of research, I can say in Nepal, Tribhuvan University is behind Kathmandu University even though the former has more branches in comparison with Kathmandu University. But both of them do not have the standard research laboratory. 
As far as I know, the government of Nepal established the research center in July 1973 in Tribhuvan University, devoted entirely to the research and development activities in the area of science and technology, named as Research Centre for Applied Science and Technology (RECAST). But it fails to give productive results because of lacking the research funds, sophisticated instruments as well as skillful manpower. Nowadays, RECAST is politically influenced having very less research work. 
It is a pity that after a decade from 1982, the government of Nepal established the academy for the promotion of science and technology as Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (RONAST), which later was renamed as the Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (NAST). This organization has own research laboratory but does not have regular electricity supply, and as such, it is not in full operation. This research laboratory has fewer funds of research activities and does not have the full range of sophisticated equipment. Nowadays, I can say NAST has given priority for the promotion of science rather than research works.  
Every problem has a solution!
This is the demand of time to upgrade the research laboratory of Nepal Academy of Science and Technology. The investment of funds for such noble work is the golden opportunity for the politically stable government of Nepal. 
It is very urgent for purchasing the sophisticated instruments as well as hiring the qualified manpower with the increasing operation time of the research laboratory. It is also necessary to welcome experts in each field of science and technology by providing handsome facilities. 
The research laboratory should be free from political influences. The name of the research laboratory should be the Central Research Laboratory in which faculty of all streams of technology and science carries out their research works. It must be fully equipped with sophisticated instruments, easily accessible to all the researchers. 
The main objective of Central Research Laboratory must be the promotion of the high quality of research in science and technology disciplines by providing facilities and technical expertise in support of basic and applied research activities. 
 Nepal has huge biodiversity and we have the huge amount of natural and medicinal plant, which can be utilized and promoted if we do the several tests in such Central Research Laboratory. The output from the research gives scientific thinking and experimental exposure for the faculty and students as well. 
I hope the government will establish such laboratory having High-Performance Computing Facility, Instrumentation Facilities, Heavy equipment Facility, Water Quality analysis and monitoring system, Chemical analysis, Industrial Bio-Technology, Advanced Materials and Processing, medical Bio-Technology, Bi-product and Process Development with Material Research.

He is all set to make a debut with renowned Bollywood actor and director for an upcoming web series that is also about India’s travel culture. This is what helps him to make it a perfect choice for director.

We ask a few questions about his debut in Bollywood :

How travel blogging impacted you as an actor?

When I started travel blogging, I was not very sure what I wanted to do. I was a shy person – for me it turned out to be my self- development course. My friends helped me to come out of my shell. After getting a call for giving audition for this, I did really well. And I’m here.

How was the journey to have an offer like this?

I came a long way to make it happen. I completed my graduation and having no job push me to do what I love. I started a travel blog on Instagram along with i was working as freelance projects. I explored so many places during my travel days, which gives me new ways to look at life. Now I’m focusing on improving my skills better and better.

Will you tell us, what is this web series all about?

The web series format has become the new favorite, especially among youth. As visual representation is a new method of storytelling which is in everyone’s reach. After exploring the places where people haven’t focused yet, we want to show new visuals of unexplored places and culture to Indian people and to the world. Through this web series, we will be able to show the rich culture and beautiful destinations which were hidden yet.

https://kathmandutribune.com/luca-scarcella-investigative-reporter-talk-about-his-web-documentary-on-education-in-yemen/,"Luca Scarcella is a talented 30 years old freelance journalist from Turin, Italy. He’s also freelance social media manager at La Stampa (a major newspaper in Italy), and a TEDx speaker, with the talk “Investigative journalism based on music theory”. Now, he’s a part of an international board of jury for two Awards (one in the social media field, called Social Creative Awards, and another on innovation and startup, called Cool Ideas by the company Protolabs). At the age of 14, he was diagnosed with Asperger’s. He’s recognized as one of the most influential under 30 in journalism right now and has done two stunning web documentaries published on La Stampa — one about Yemen’s education system: “Sui Muri della Libertà”, that means “On the Walls of Freedom”.

What motivated you to become a journalist? 

Investigate the reality. This is what a journalist does. Journalism offers information that allows people to make decisions about their lives. Democracy continues to exist also thanks to journalists that continue to do their work, risking their lives, and continue to believe that they can make a difference. First of all, wondering, making questions, asking “why”, that for me remains the most important of the “5 W” of journalism. Since I was a kid, I always had the desire to understand things deeper, to understand which “why” was hiding behind what I saw and felt. So, I wanted to pursue a career as a journalist to offer people answers to their questions.
2) Has education played a key role in shaping you? Was it a factor for you to visit Yemen in 2018 for a web documentary on education? 
Certainly university education was fundamental for me because it made me discover the passion for sociology. Studying sociology had and has a huge impact on my way to think, to work, to live. Sociology is the study of society, patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture of everyday life. I use sociology’s methods of investigation in journalism. I didn’t have the chance to visit Yemen, but I read, studied and investigated for a long time, thanks to the help of journalists from the Yemeni area, and not only. It’s a Nation tormented by decades of wars for border control, and this situation has obviously been poured into education and the future of the new Yemeni generations. Talking to one of the protagonists of my web documentary, the award-winner street artist Murad Subay, he thanked me “for talking about education in Yemen, nobody does, and the situation is really serious”.
3) What did you find out in the education system of Yemen? Do you think the war has put an end to it? 
There is a strong control of the government’s military forces on education, that cause distortion of educational programs in favor of regime propaganda. Furthermore, war, famine, and epidemics have had serious effects on every aspect of everyday life, including school education. According to UNICEF “an entire generation of children in Yemen does not see the future, due to limited or non-existent access to education”. There must be a greater effort at the international level to stop the clashes and get people back on their feet. Then there are isolated cases, like a school in Taiz, the most tormented city in Yemen, founded by a master in his ruined house, which saves 700 children from having to pass the “fire line” every day among the enemy militias, in this civil conflict, which, the UN warns, could cause 230,000 deaths by the end of 2019.
4) In your documentary “On the Walls of  Freedom” you have mentioned that art has helped a lot of youths having the syndrome overcome it via art. Was it the same for you? 
I will always say that music saves my life. I have always been able to express myself through the piano and music, and every time I can paint and draw. Art is a human expression: doesn’t matter with which medium, but thanks to art I can express myself. And I find art also in journalism, and I always try to combine art with my journalistic works.
5) What’s your view of Italy’s role in Yemen’s war?  
Italy does not have a key role in Yemen’s war. But, of course, Italy, like any other Country, can push for a solution to the conflict.
6) How do you feel Italy allowing the sale of bombs (made in Sardinia) to Saudi Arabia despite strict regulation on arms sales to nations engaged in arm conflict and having a record of serious human rights violations? 
I feel bad, of course. But as long as at the sale of bombs is not prevented, unfortunately, Countries will continue to sell arms.
7) Did your web documentary achieve anything substantial? Do you think art will overcome bitterness among Yemenis? 
My web documentary gets very famous in Yemen, thanks to Murad Subay who is called “the Yemenite Banksy”. He is very popular in Yemen, and I have received many sincere tokens of esteem from young Yemenis. Art is important, it has always been, in every process of democratization in the world. It is a fundamental part of a Country’s culture.
8) Is there any hope for Yemen’s future education system? What’s your message to the Italy government? 
This war has to end, and I hope it ends soon. Certainly, there is a future, and young Yemenis must not stop fighting for their future. What Murad Subay does with his art, for example, is so, so important: he brings hope, brings back the desire to look to the future through art. My message is: let’s talk about this war that is called “the forgotten war”. Let’s talk about Yemen, in newspapers, on social media. Stop the war. Now.

https://kathmandutribune.com/five-things-about-ryan-hintze-the-24-year-old-digital-marketing-expert/,"Ryan Hintze is a successful lifestyle influencer, Wilhelmina fitness model and founder of digital consulting, influencer marketing and e-commerce company “Hintze Media”.
Ryan has taken no for an answer. If he wants something in life he finds every way possible to get it. Ryan started selling his old Pokémon cards on eBay when he was 11 years old so he could buy his own skateboard. His parents didn’t spoil him with “wants”, they only supplied him with “needs”. So his mom told him he had to find ways to make money if he wanted to buy a skateboard. He learned that he could have anything he wanted if he worked hard. It was that lesson that marked the start of Ryan’s obsession with selling products and services online.
When Ryan sets goals, often times he doesn’t know exactly how he’s going to achieve them. He exhausts every possible option until he gets what he wants. Ryan believes that whatever energy he puts into the earth with eventually happen for him. “So many people are wired to be 9-5 employees and not do anything that might attract criticism. “I’ve never been like that, I always had an issue with being told what to do and not being in control of my life.”
Ryan played 6 sports in high school and 2 sports in college. “School and playing division one college football was tough for me because I was being treated like an average joe and was being taught in school to be a normal employee, not an entrepreneur. Most of the time I just bit my tongue and was happy to know that once I graduated I would regain control of my life.”
Ryan first fell in love with digital media and e-commerce when he was in high school. His high school really put an emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) and he was able to take full advantage of everything his school had to offer. He graduated with 19 industry certifications in Adobe, Microsoft, Solidworks and CIW programs. He used the technical skills he learned in high school to launch his company at age 14 offering web and graphic design services in his community during the end of high school and through college.
Networking has played a key role in Ryan’s success. The relationships and people he met when he first started his business played a key role in his success because they recognized his talent and were his first customers. With over 500,000 followers on all of Ryan’s personal social media accounts, he makes sure to respond to every email and the direct message he receives from his fans, brands, and colleagues. “So many people miss out on opportunities because they neglect to monitor their communication outlets” He advises everyone to make sure they take the time to stay on top of their communications. “You never know when your next customer, future business partner or the brand deal could be digitally knocking on your door.” He takes every chance he can to meet new people and rubs elbows with industry leaders, on and offline.
Most of all Ryan loves to outwork his competition, solve problems and sell products that make his customers happy. “At the end of the day I always over-deliver on every brand deal I work on, every client I work with and hope they remember me the next time they in the market for my services.”

https://kathmandutribune.com/hip-hop-no-more-a-mans-world-says-miss-money/,"Hip Hop has grown to become one of the most popular genres of music today. Just like the rest of the music industry, hip hop and rap have been vastly dominated by men, with a relatively smaller percentage of female artists making it to the top. However, this convention is changing for the better, with more and more female rappers and artists making a name for themselves. When it comes to talented female rappers, the name Miss Money comes to mind.
Originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Miss Money started her music career from scratch. She began rapping at the age of 10 and continued to perform, quickly gaining traction amid the local rap scene.  From stage shows, performances, and local shows, Miss Money began to gain popularity. Her unique style, powerful stage presence, and hard-hitting lyrics truly touched the chord with audiences everywhere. “There was a time, when people mocked me, only because I was a female rapper. I just focused on what I do best, I rapped, I performed and it was straight from the heart. People loved my work, and here I am,” said Miss Money.
Though some of the pioneers of rap and hip hop were women, the industry remained biased in its perspective. In recent years, this notion is being decimated by several female artists and performers, while record labels are being far more supportive to upcoming female talent. Female artists are rising to the top and gaining some much-deserved appreciation. Miss Money adds, “It’s always been harder for a female rapper to get a break, but things are changing and fast. Today, women are turning the tables, and believe me, there’s no stopping us now.”
Today, Miss Money has earned herself a great deal of respect and recognition in the industry. She has worked alongside some of the biggest names in the industry that include Run-D.M.C. and Wiz Khalifa. She has also worked with DeJ Loaf, Young M.A., Cardi B, Jadakiss, Lil Durk, MoneyBagg Yo, Bubba Sparxxx, DMX, Polo G, Snootie Wild, and Kirko Bangz. One of her most popular tracks ‘On the Nephs’ gained widespread attention after its release. She is currently working on ‘Pull Up’ with Boosie Badazz, a hip hop veteran who has been in the industry since the early 1990s. Miss Money will also be launching her line of shoes, ‘Rich Kickz,’ in partnership with AliveShoes.
Miss Money is one of those women who have pursued their passion and succeeded in it. Whether it’s the music industry, or otherwise, women have proved their worth time after time. Hip Hop and rap are no exceptions and one thing is clear, it certainly is not a man’s world anymore.

https://kathmandutribune.com/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-dillon-kivo/,"You’re probably familiar with young entrepreneur Dillon Kivo and his inspirational story of achieving financial success at an early age. Kivo is the Founder and Editor-In-Chief of the fastest growing business magazines, Kivo Daily. He currently travels around the world giving lectures and offering mentoring services to aspiring entrepreneurs who want to learn his secrets to building wealth and financial freedom. Kivo’s pursued several different entrepreneurial endeavors over the years and does not believe in wasting time. However, there are some interesting things about Kivo and his story that you probably don’t know. Some of these things may even surprise you to learn. 
Let’s look at what they are:
1) He Is a Hockey Fan
When Kivo was growing up in California, he started to play hockey at the young age of 4 years old. As he got older, he participated in the junior hockey league and won several national championships. A scout even offered him the chance to play hockey for a college in Boston, MA. Just when he was planning to go professional, he injured his wrist during a hockey game. This prevented him from joining the National Hockey League.
2) Puts Family First
A lot of people don’t realize that Kivo is a devoted family man. He loves spending time with his wife and family whenever he can. Since he is a world traveler as part of his work, it makes it difficult for Kivo to stay home. That is why he loves traveling with his wife because he can balance his work and family life much better. And when his family is unable to travel, Kivo makes every effort to stay at home and use the internet to conduct his business and teachings. 
3) Has Worked with Many Notable People
Kivo is considered to be a “media mogul” by the New York Times because of the Fortune 500 companies, politicians, Olympic athletes, CEOs, Shark Tank companies, and other notable entities he’s worked with over the years. That is why millions of people from around the globe are interested in seeking his guidance and expert advice. 
4) He’s a Hustler
Kivo has owned his own business since he was 12 years old. He’s done everything from selling lemonade on the streets to t-shirts in high school. He doesn’t believe in wasting time watching TV or playing video games like other people his own age. He’s always been a hustler at heart who’s constantly looking for the next deal to make. However, that doesn’t mean he didn’t work hard either. In fact, Kivo would work 12 to 15 hours per day setting up his businesses for success. He never complained about it either because the hustle made it too exciting for him. 
5) Believes in God
Kivo believes that God exists everywhere, including within himself. God flows within him because of this belief. It allows him to achieve his desires, goals, and needs all at once. How is this possible? God gives him infinite intelligence to conquer his uncertainties in order to gain certainty. This helps push Kivo to try new entrepreneurial pursuits which most people might feel uneasy or uncertainty about. By becoming one with God, Kivo loves variety and surprises. This is a big part of why he is so successful.

https://kathmandutribune.com/conversation-with-cp-gajurel-nepal-still-needs-a-revolution-to-make-the-constitution-inclusive/,"Senior party leader and Vice-chairman of CPN-Revolutionary (Maoist) leader CP Gajurel was skeptical about the 2015 constitution and termed it as ‘retrogressive and discriminatory’. However, he said that his party would participate in the 2017-18 polls under the PPPN party. Kathmandu Tribune’s Arun Budhathoki talked with Gajurel regarding his experience in the local polls, constitution amendment, and Nepal-China relations.
Here are the excerpts:
Why did you decide to participate in the May 14, 2017 polls?
Gajurel: Even though we opposed and condemned the current constitution which is nothing but a regressive and reaction one, we decided to go to the polls. The reason why we participated in the election is that it was for the common people—masses. We did not call it participation but used the election for a revolutionary purpose. Our aim for participating in the poll was not to form a government or gain posts but to organize the masses at the local level and prepare for the next revolution.

We think that Nepal still needs a revolution to make the constitution inclusive. Therefore, in order to be attached to the masses, we had to participate in the election.

So to safeguard the people and their right we thought that we have to put forward candidates. In the past, we had the experience of getting involved in polls where we used the platform for revolutionary purposes. During the partyless panchayat system, we had participated in the election. Also, prior to starting People’s War in 1996, we participated in the local polls. And by participating in the election we were able to mobilize, educate and organize the masses for the preparation of people’s war. So we have that experience and taking account of all these factors we decided to participate in the 2017 polls.
In 2008 CA your party could have been the fourth largest party but since the Baidya-led party boycotted the parliament it didn’t materialize. Do you now regret the decision?
Gajurel: We do not regret that decision because we still think that the decision of the party to boycott the Constituent Assembly Part 2 was correct. Because of the boycott, a demarcating line was created between the revolutionary and reactionary force. Although politically many people assumed that we could have become the fourth largest party, which is partly true, as we didn’t have a member of parliament in the government—but, we think that if we had participated in the election the difference between revolutionary and reactionary force would have been blurred. Drawing a demarcating line is very important for revolutionary forces. And we could do that. The first CA was a big burden for Maoist party and they conspired to dissolve it. And by conspiring to dissolve it they held reelection of CA. The main issue was of that party trying to cover up the dissolution of the first CA. So they organized the election, formed the government under the leadership of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. It was a big conspiracy against the people so by boycotting the election we could expose the regressive move. Thus, we could create a demarcating line that helped us to establish our position among the public.
A lot of people thought that CPN-UML might be the biggest gainer in the 2017 polls. What did you think of it?
Gajurel: It was difficult to predict which will be the largest party in the 2017 polls. However, UML was hopeful and enthusiastic about them being the largest party post-polls. The reason was that Prachanda was exposed already as a pro-India and had been criticized by the public that he had completely surrendered to India. On the other hand, KP Oli had taken a nationalist stand even though he too was exposed due to the ‘Mahakali Treaty’ which was signed under his initiative. One of the largest rivers was handed over to India and it is called the infamous Mahakali treaty. Oli was exposed as a pro-Indian but now he has changed into a nationalist. Hence, Oli used his nationalism stand to win the poll in the majority. Then, UML was second in the parliament and Nepali Congress (NC) had contested too to become the first or second. So we couldn’t really predict who was going to be the largest party in the coming days. But now we know who’s the winner.
Did you think Prachanda was going to hand over the prime minister post to Deuba post-polls?
Gajurel: It was definite.
What about the June 14th poll and budget?
Gajurel: After the election on May 14th Prachanda was supposed to hand over his post to Deuba in a week or so. The budget was also to be endorsed before May 29th as mentioned in the constitution.
Did you think constitution amendment would go through before the second-phase election? Did you think Madheshi parties would join the election?
Gajurel: There was a split in Madheshi front after Upendra Yadav was expelled from the party for betraying their cause by deciding to participate in the polls. Yadav had joined hands with leaders of non-Madhesi parties like Baburam Bhattarai, and Ashok Rai. Yadav was going to participate in the election through that new alliance. Thus, the Madheshi parties felt betrayed by Yadav’s decision to take part in the polls without letting the constitution amendment go through. And the Madheshi parties feel betrayed due to this move because they were clear about passing the amendment bill first and then participate in the polls. Also, the election of the Madheshi belt would happen on June 14th. The other Madhesi parties would not participate in the second-phase election if the bill won’t be passed. That’s what I thought.
Did you think the second-phase election would be held? What did you think about NC-Maoist alliance?
Gajurel: It was not certain because Madheshi parties didn’t have their majority in the parliament and as we know UML was strongly opposing it. The Madheshi parties or Prachanda wouldn’t succeed in achieving a two-thirds majority. And that’s what happened.

The Deuba-Prachanda alliance had been formed by India and Prachanda was chosen by our southern neighbor to oust KP Oli since Prachanda had an alliance with Oli.

However, the NC-Maoist alliance wouldn’t be able to get two-third majority no matter what they try to do. Even after Gachhadhar joined the government they won’t be able to do it. Also, it was not sure if the government would be able to survive without the support of UML.
Did you think UML was scared about the NC-Maoist alliance? How about Kamal Thapa’s move?
Gajurel: Small fringe parties easily succumb to bribe and posts but UML was stern about its move. It was a common case for political parties and leaders to change their decision in Nepali political circle so nothing surprising about Kamal Thapa’s decision to support the constitutional amendment.
Was India against the polls or was it supporting to dismantle UML?
Gajurel: India has changed their opinion after they could form an alliance with Deuba-Prachanda. They were not in favor of election when Oli was the prime minister. They became comfortable since they had the ‘puppet government’. There was a possibility that India could tell the Madheshi parties to join the election without the passing the amendment bill. It was because the decision of Madheshi parties lies in the hands of India.

It is India who decided the policy of Madhesi parties.

Did you think India would have waited for the amendment bill to pass if that alliance had become stable?
Gajurel: It makes no difference for India whether it is Deuba or Prachanda. That alliance was formed with the agreement that Prachanda would be the PM for nine months and after that Deuba would take over. Deuba wouldn’t accept if Prachanda continued to be the prime minister. In that case, Deuba had to withdraw the support for Prachanda. Moreover, Prachanda had no choice but to hand over his post to Deuba.
 What’s your view on the impeachment motion against CJ Karki?
Gajurel: In the name of democracy the NC-Maoist were exercising dictatorship of a bourgeois class. Why was that impeachment put forward? What was the background of it? The main issue was with the appointment of Inspector General police. Deuba wanted to nominate his own guy who represented from the Far Western region who was also close to him. And there was Nawaraj Silwal who is a qualified guy and per points, he got a better position. But by the pressure of Deuba, the cabinet decided to make the other guy IG. Silwal ultimately went to the SC and CJ Karki took the decision against Deuba and Prachanda. That was the main reason for the impeachment. It is quite an injustice to do so against CJ Karki.
The Deuba-Prachanda alliance went forward with the impeachment to terrorize the judiciary and those who are in line to replace CJ Karki. They sent a clear message that a big lesson will be taught to the legal authorities if they don’t follow their movements. But they failed to so as they faced international criticism. They are clearly tried to save their face and if they withdrew the impeachment motion it would be a failure to them. And according to the norms of bourgeois democracy if a prime minister fails to pass the bill he has to resign. But unfortunately, Prachanda even doesn’t have that morality. He’s not even at the level of bourgeois democracy. He’s merely a stooge of India and won’t resign from the post. Later, they tried to compromise with the CJ by saying that if she takes leave for a month they would withdraw the impeachment but CJ said she wouldn’t take a decision unilaterally but won’t take leave. CJ Karki won the case because she got support from former CJs, chief of the UN human rights commission and other key leaders.
How do you evaluate India and China’s role in Nepal’s internal politics at the beginning of 2017?
Gajurel: In bilateral talks with CPC I’ve told repeatedly that China’s role is passive in Nepal. It is not playing any diplomatic role and not supporting any pro-China forces. We do not support intervention from China too but it should play an active role to counterbalance the Indian domination in Nepal. To play that role is not interference and when India is interfering nakedly China is saying nothing about it. But in the name of non-interference China is playing a zero role. It only hands out fund for projects but negligence presence. China isn’t getting any projects because India has its structural control in Nepal. Moreover, the former Indian ambassador to Nepal is highly active compared to his former Chinese counterpart.
Moreover, India is controlling the whole things of Nepal. It not only formed the alliance but even decides who becomes the home minister, foreign minister and has to say on important bureaucratic posts. China does nothing about it and those who are suffering from India’s hegemony have grievances against China for staying idle. So, China can play an active role without interfering. Perhaps China disregards India’s role in Nepal since it sees the United States as its competitor and not India. I’ve had experiences with CPC leaders saying China doesn’t care about India since India cannot compete with China in any aspect.

It is true that the US is the main contender for China but it should know that India is playing a role like US imperialism.

India is against China and we can see at monasteries here where police can’t enter. Dalai Lama is playing that role. Deuba and other MPs visit Dalai Lama and they are using Nepal as a good place to provoke the Tibetan issue. Nepal has become a good place for India to carry out anti-China activities due to the open border. Indians can come to Nepal and stay any number of years and do whatever they want. India and the US are making Nepal a good place for anti-China activities. I don’t know why China has become so inactive knowing that the Free Tibet movement is being encouraged in Nepal. At the end of the day, this policy of China won’t be in favor of safeguarding the national security of China. And the friends and common people of Nepal support China but they aren’t getting any support from China. But sadly, China is passive. This will make things difficult for China. Everyone knows in Nepal that China supports Nepal economically. Nepali people understand that China is a good and reliable friend. But the role played by the government through embassy is imperative since the ambassador represents the country. China has enough opportunity to make an impact in Nepal but it has restrained itself, which is quite sad.
I felt the former ambassador was not quite bold and that made a big difference.

Interestingly, India also controls few mainstream media and even decides which media gets the number of advertisement. This kind of control by India in Nepal is astounding.

What’s your opinion on OBOR? Do you think Prachanda has been trying to protect Nepal’s sovereignty?
Gajurel: Nepal decided to join OBOR after getting a green signal from Indian PM Modi. However, it will be a good thing for Nepal in the long run since the US has tried to influence the region for a long time. It is in the interest of oppressed countries.
Prachanda has got enough support from China but prior to People’s War, he has been in the side of India. He has only tried to use China. Other forces in Nepal who support China, however, haven’t got any support.
We know the time when Prachanda visited China first and returned he told at the airport that India would be his first diplomatic visit. Internally he has already surrendered to India.

The time when we were in prison in India Prachanda and Baburam had walked freely but I and my chairman were arrested and charged as a terrorist.

The charge against me was that I tried to capture a police station in Assam, a place I’ve never visited, with the Indian Maoist. There are several pieces of evidence, including two books, which reveals Prachanda and Baburam as pro-India. It also mentions that Baburam worked as a link for Research & Analysis Wing (RAW). Prachanda used Baburam for that connection. Both are tested pro-India.
Moreover, Nepali people and few forces are frustrated with indifferent China.
Do you have any concrete suggestions for China to play an active role?
Gajurel: First, China needs to build confidence with political parties who are reliable. And China should make two-type of relation with political parties: party-to-party and government-to-government. Most importantly, China should support forces that are reliable and trust them too.
China is providing scholarships and funds to anti-Chinese people and forces in Nepal. So, China should be clear about this policy and think in a different manner because India is clear about whom they want to support. India will never provide funds or scholarships to us. They sometimes invite me because they like to know our views.
Nepal is a small country, we know each other, and we are familiar with agencies that work for India. They are clearly winning against China.

https://kathmandutribune.com/amar-sirohi-the-man-who-brought-street-food-of-delhi-on-instagram/,"If you go through the feed of any food blogger from Delhi, you will definitely find tempting photos and videos of street food delicacies. It was not the case always. It started in 2015 when Amar Sirohi who runs @foodie_incarnate on Instagram started posting pictures of street food from Old Delhi. Not only he started the trend of posting street food on Instagram, but he is also credited for bringing on Instagram for the first time the majority of street food dishes of Delhi.

Be it Gur Ka Sharbat from Chitli Qabar, Shahi Tukra of Matia Mahal, Chur Chur Naan of Kashmir Sweet Shop, Moth Kachori & Bheega Kulcha of Multani Dhanda, Bedmi Poori of SitaRam Bazar, Bade Mian ki Kheer of Sirkiwalan, Hapshi Halwa & Kulle Chaat of Chawri Bazar, Chole Bhature of Nand, Khurchan of Kinari Bazar, Halwa Paratha of Nizamuddin, Mawa Jalebi of Jama Masjid, Paneer Pakora of Shakti Nagar, Sindhi Samosa of Fatehpuri Masjid, Sita Bhog & Rasgulla Chaat of CR Park, Laphing of Majnu ka Tila, Dhokla Sandwich of Nehru Place, the first food blogger to bring them on Instagram was Amar Sirohi on his page @foodieincarnate in 2015-16.

After making the street food of old Delhi famous on Instagram, he changed another perception. The perception that you can not find anything worth eating in east Delhi. He along with his blogger friend Karan put out dozens of street food delicacies from Shahdara & Krishna Nagar which were completely hidden gems till then. Jain’s White Butter Sandwich, Dhakkan ki Kachori, Bansal’s Jalebi, Shyam’s Lassi, Kumar’s Vada Pav & Pav Bhaji, Krishna Nagar’s Milkcake & Chota Bazar’s Threesome Kachoris are just to name a few dishes which are incredibly famous nowadays. No one had posted about them on Instagram until they did. They conducted a couple of food walks in these areas and after that, a lot of food bloggers, even those who had the perception that there is nothing worth eating in east Delhi started visiting east Delhi to try these dishes.

Not only he brought on Insta the food joints which were already popular in their neighborhood but he also popularized some dishes that no one was even familiar with, even in their areas of operation. For example, the humble Phalsa Sharbat of Parmatma Jaiswal. Amar encountered a small thela having phalsa fruit during one of his food exploration trip in Paharganj. He had heard about phalsa sharbat from one of his friend from Lahore. He gave it a try and loved it instantly. He posted a video and photo of it in 2017 and in the summer of next year, every other blogger of Delhi was after this sharbatwala. It became so popular that now almost everyone knows about this thela in that locality.

It took him countless walks in the streets of Delhi trying the food at every other shop and roadside stall to bring out the tastiest variation of the dishes which are available in Delhi. It took a lot of hard work but like all hard works, it also paid rich dividends, making him one of the biggest name of the food blogging industry in India.

After putting the street food of Delhi on the map, he has plans to cover the food of all the major cities of Delhi. Looking at his credentials, we are certain to see many more hidden gems from Indian cities to be brought into focus soon.

Don’t you just hate when you’re sipping cocktails by the ocean, enjoying the steaming hot weather and all of sudden your make-up starts dripping off, making you look like a baked cake? Well, we’ve all been THERE, rushing to the ladies room to fix up the mess! With pool parties and beach frolicking, summer also brings sweaty and sticky weather that can take a great toll on your skin and hair. Therefore, it’s better to be equipped with all the beauty hacks to make yourself a summer goddess this season.
Kathmandu Tribune has enlisted 5 must needed summer beauty hacks that will simply change your make up game!
1. Avoid dry hair with ready-to-use conditioner
The scorching sun and chlorine infused water of the swimming pool make your hair dry and dead. It leads to hair fall and split ends and ultimately ruins your whole look! To avoid this, all you need is a travel-sized spray bottle and your regular hair conditioner. Add two/three tablespoons of your normal conditioner in the spray bottle and add water. Mix it well and spray it every time after swimming or a dive on the beach!

2. Set Your Make up
Setting your make up before heading out on the sun is another major hack. But we’ve all been there when we’ve just finished our touch up and the summer heat already starts ruining the perfect makeup! During such emergencies, grab a blow dryer and blast your face with cold air and voila, you’re all set to go. If you have any doubt about this, you can always go for a setting spray from the good makeup brands.

3. Use Vinegar To Avoid Your Hair color From Fading
Protect your glamorous hair color and locks from going dull due to the sun blaze by using the over the counter apple cider vinegar. Vinegar has the magical benefits to brighten up your hair color giving you the right pop you need. Pour 1/2 cups of vinegar into a spray bottle and sprinkle it to your hair leaving for about 10 minutes and wash it out. Keep using this hack for more long-lasting hair color!

4. Use Yogurt for Itchy Scalp
Sweat, heat, and pollution leave your hair dry with an irksome itchy scalp. Using a shampoo with heavy chemicals will definitely not help, hence, instead, you can opt for a quick DIY hack. All you require is a bowl of yogurt, two aspirin pills, and water. Crush the aspirin pills in a bowl with one tbs of water an add two tablespoons of yogurt and mix well. Apply the mixture all over your scalp and leave it to set for 15 minutes. Rinse and condition your hair and you’ll get rid of itchy scalp right away.

5. Switch To BB or CC Cream
Foundation and heat don’t go together, so switching to a more lighter BB or CC cream would be the best to avoid dripping make up. There are many such products that provide fine and long-lasting coverage during the summer. BB cream doesn’t melt if you start sweating and it’s the ultimate makeup goal, isn’t it?

https://kathmandutribune.com/7-reasons-to-stay-single-and-be-happy/,"7 Reasons To Stay Single And Be Happy!
Love itself is a beautiful feeling and falling in love with someone, having a person who’ll stand by you through thick and thin is the best thing that can happen to anyone. But, the idea of love with the WRONG PERSON at the WRONG TIME definitely ruins the actual purpose of it.
Many of us grow up thinking we have to find the other half who will complete us and make us happy. The fear of being alone compels us to stay in relationships with the person you don’t love and that no longer make you and your partner happy. Do you too have this fear that you’ll end up alone in your life? Do you always wind up heartbroken after jumping from one relationship to the next?
If you do, then it’s time to STOP! Although everyone around you is settling down and the pressure is killing you inside, it’s time to hold the brakes and enjoy a whole new world around you, it’s time to stay single and exploit your freedom! How you might ask, well, Kathmandu Tribune has enlisted 7 awesome reasons to Go-solo this year and stick to it! Stay put!
1.Focus on Yourself
When you choose to be single, you choose to be in the relationship with yourself, you’re committed to yourself and this gives you time to give 100% focus on YOU. You don’t have to make anyone else a priority, instead, you can plan, plot, take a risk and do everything on your own and build an empire out of it!

2. Less Drama/Stress
The major problem of this generation relationship is “the fear of being alone.” As long as you have this fear, whether you are single or in a relationship, you will always be stressed out! And stressed relationships are probably the worst relationships.

People rush into a relationship thinking it will solve their problems and make a happily ever after but in reality, being happy alone is the ultimate goal. If you can make yourself happy, nobody will have the power to take away that happiness, hence less stress and more fun in your life!
3. Having A Bed All To Yourself
We need sex but sleep is more important. When you have to share your bed with your partner who snores or who takes away all your blanket then the inner you will definitely regret not being single!

4. Time For Your Career
What if we tell you that instead of a person, the job you have always dreamt of can make you happy? Yes, you read that right! Your career can be the love of your life and you can give all the time to it which will definitely enable you to achieve more in every step.

5. Discovering Yourself
How many of you truly know who you are or what are your passions? The biggest mistake anyone can ever do in his/her life is not discovering oneself and following your passion. Very few couples understand the passion of one’s partner and they help each other follow it but in most cases, we just waste time doing things to make your husband/wife happy. Therefore, discovering your thrive is another major reason to stay single.

6. Freedom To Experiment
Staying single will give you the chance to devour all the fantasies of casual sex, hookups and one night stands. At the end of the day, you can enjoy your freedom without any commitments to hold you down. Experimenting is quite important to find out what you really want and what you can handle from where you are right now. One night stands or committed relationship? It’s your call!

7. Eat all By yourself
This one is for all the foodies who love eating and don’t like sharing food. When you are in a relationship, it forces us to share food and try food that we don’t even like! So why torture your belly and your taste buds? Be single, enjoy your plate full of different delicacies.

Well, going single is perhaps a not bad idea! What say, folks? Are you ready to say NO?

https://kathmandutribune.com/secretary-mimicked-her-boss-for-67-yrs-everyone-is-shocked-by-her-secret-fortune-and-what-she-did-with-it/,"Sylvia Bloom worked as a secretary at the same New York City law firm for most of her life. A practical woman and a hard worker, to the outside world she was modest and lived a frugal lifestyle—but she had a secret practice no one knew about.
She earned a meager annual income, never talked about money, and wasn’t living the ‘high life’. She was never showy and didn’t want to call attention to herself.
“She was a child of the Depression and she knew what it was like not to have money..” Bloom’s niece Jane Lockshin told The New York Times. “She had great empathy for other people who were needy and wanted everybody to have a fair shake.”
Secretaries, in those days, ran their boss’s lives, including their investments. Whenever she would see her boss make a stock pick— and purchase it for him—she would buy the same stock for herself, but in smaller amounts befitting her secretary’s salary.

She kept track of all the investments until she finally retired at age 96. When she died shortly thereafter, it was discovered that Ms. Bloom had amassed a huge fortune.
She never told anyone about it, but before her retirement from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, she had stashed away over nine million dollars.
“I don’t think she thought it was anybody’s business but her own,” says Lockshin.
She left some of it to friends and family in her will, but directed that all the rest was to be left to a charity in New York City that cares for the adults and children whom she thought needed it most.
The endowment, $6.24 million to the Henry Street Settlement, is being used to create a college scholarship fund, which is especially fitting since Ms. Bloom always regretted not going to law school – but her incredible donation will ensure that plenty of New Yorkers will have the opportunities she never took—and maybe even graduate from law school!

Keep the buzz. Lose the hangover.

“Civilization begins with distillation,” said William Faulkner, a writer, and drinker. Although our thirst for alcohol dates back to the Stone Age, nobody has figured out a good way to deal with the ensuing hangover after getting drunk.
As a chemical engineering professor and wine enthusiast, I felt I needed to find a solution. As frivolous as this project may sound, it has serious implications. Between 8 and 10 percent of emergency room visits in America are due to acute alcohol poisoning. Alcohol is the leading risk factor for premature deaths and disability among people aged 15-49 and its abuse leads to serious health problems, including cardiovascular and liver cancer. Despite these sobering facts, current treatments for alcohol overdose largely rely on the body’s own enzymes to break down this drug.
I decided to design an antidote that could help people enjoy wine or cocktails or beer without a hangover, and at the same time create a lifesaving therapy to treat intoxication and overdose victims in the ER. I chose to create capsules filled with natural enzymes usually found in liver cells to help the body process the alcohol faster.
Together with professor Cheng Ji, an expert in liver diseases from Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, and my graduate student Duo Xu, we developed an antidote and tested it in mice.
Inspired by the body’s approach for breaking down alcohol, we chose three natural enzymes that convert alcohol into harmless molecules that are then excreted. That might sound simple because these enzymes were not new, but the tricky part was to figure out a safe, effective way to deliver them to the liver.
To protect the enzymes, we wrapped each of them in a shell, using a material the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had already approved for pills. We then injected these nanocapsules into the veins of drunk mice where they hurtled through the circulatory system, eventually arriving in the liver where they entered the cells and served as mini-reactors to digest alcohol.
We showed that in inebriated mice (which fall asleep much faster than drunk humans), the treatment decreased the blood alcohol level by 45 percent in just four hours compared to mice that didn’t receive any. Meanwhile, the blood concentration of acetaldehyde – a highly toxic compound that is carcinogenic, causes headaches and vomiting, makes people blush after drinking, and is produced during the normal alcohol metabolism – remained extremely low. The animals given the drug woke from their alcohol-induced slumber faster than their untreated counterparts – something all college students would appreciate.
The ability to efficiently break down alcohol quickly should help patients wake up earlier and prevent alcohol poisoning. It should also protect their liver from alcohol–associated stress and damage.
We are currently completing tests to ensure that our nanocapsules are safe and don’t trigger unexpected or dangerous side effects. If our treatments prove effective in animals, we could begin human clinical trials in as early as one year.
This sort of antidote won’t stop people from going too far when consuming alcohol, but it could help them recover quicker. In the meantime, we plan on drinking responsibly and hope that you do too.

https://kathmandutribune.com/tengoku-feel-the-difference-a-fancy-yet-friendly-restaurant-in-the-neighbourhood/,"There’s a new restaurant in Lalitpur: Tengoku — Feel The Difference. Restaurants and Cafes inside Kathmandu valley are overabundant and the fact that every boulevard of the city has a plethora of such fancy restaurants often makes us perplexed to make a smart choice.
While nightclubs and bars are taking over the market, the culture of going to a fine dining restaurant and other eateries with your friends and families has transformed and now the young generation is in search of a great blend: a place where you can enjoy live music, dine like in a fine diner, enjoy serene ambiance for quality time and a crowd-friendly restaurant, all served up in one plate!
Tengoku: Feel The Difference/Facebook
If you’re in quest of such place, Tengoku Lounge and Bar, situated in the heart of Kathmandu valley, is a perhaps a smart choice.  I wandered into the restaurant one evening with a friend on a Friday night and was immediately impressed by the friendly nature and hospitality of staffs and of course the cozy yet lively ambiance of the place!
Opening Hours: 11:00 AM- 10:00 PM
Location:
Easily accessible from any part of the town, the restaurant is located in Kumaripati, Lalitpur, on 5th and 6th floor of a building with a big Yahama showroom. The official opening of the restaurant took place on New Year 2075 and it is already becoming a favorite hang out place for the most youngsters.

Atmosphere/Decor:
“Tengoku”, the name derived from Japanese phrase that means paradise or a kingdom of heaven definitely gives one a feeling of ultimate happiness and euphoria as you enter the place. The place has three different settings:

A sitting area with bar on the 5th floor that resembles a cottage decor fused with the luxury of modernity. Sitting at any table you can watch the big screen tv on the wall where you can enjoy movies and live matches.



A lounge area with attached bar on the 6th floor, perfectly arranged with leather couches, a comfortable setting to enjoy the booze and live music. A live band plays songs every weekend and you can enjoy the special events of the place like ladies night, game nights with amazing discounts.



A Terrace with beautiful garden from where you can see the breathtaking view of Kathmandu valley. The system of the open kitchen will definitely impress you and the sight of professional chefs working together to prepare masterpiece of a dish is satisfactory.


Food:
Tengoku serves an array of exquisite cuisine; Indian, Nepali, Continental, and Japanese, hence the place is convenient for different people with different taste and palate. The restaurant is, however, focusing on Japanese cuisine, bringing the traditional cuisine of Japan on our table using seasonal ingredients. Some of the dishes that you must try when you visit include Karaage( floured and deep fried battered chicken) and  Tempura(fish, prawns or vegetables deep fried in a non-greasy batter).

With the outstanding teamwork and cooking expertise from three professional chefs, Mr. Lok Bahadur Maharjan( Former Chef Of Everest Hotel), Dinesh Maharjan( Japanese cuisine expert) and Shankhar Man Maharjan(a well-experienced chef who’s worked in Mauritius), the food in Tengoku won’t disappoint you and is worth every penny!
Special Events:
Aside from good food and comfy ambiance, the restaurant also offers special events and other entertaining activities throughout the week. The lounge organizes Ladies Night every Wednesdays and Fridays with Free cocktails and complimentary drinks for the ladies. Every weekend, they invite local bands for the live music session and it’s certainly a refreshment to watch and listen to new and young artists.
A Karaoke session, movie and game night is already on the soon-to-be list of the restaurant. Swarna Shrestha, the Marketing Manager of the restaurant explains “the main motto of Tengoku is to provide quality food, tons of entertainment and best service for the customer at a reasonable cost.”

To sum up, it’s a once-a-visit place to enjoy the best food and a fun night with your friends and families at a comfortable price.

https://kathmandutribune.com/child-marriage-in-nepal-a-culture-that-kills/,"I am 23, will soon be turning 24, I still think I’m a kid. I make stupid decisions, do crazy things. Almost two years after my bachelor’s, a teacher now, I still don’t know what I really want to do with my future, with my life.  Not everyone has this privilege. Countless many kids don’t even get a shot a childhood. Their dreams are snatched away even before they realize the meaning of the word “dream”. When, down the line, finally they understand the essence of the word, they have their flesh and blood crying and struggling for life on their laps. And the cycle continues. 
16-year-old Sapana (name changed) is to be married on the 8th of this month. An innocent girl reading in 8th grade who is yet to find her calling is now being prepared, with pomp and joy, to be sent away to a man she barely knows. She will be accompanied to this strange household of the people she knows nothing about with possibly a huge debt in her family’s name. Her father dares to take massive loans to send his daughter but no! education is too expensive. 
15-year-old Inshiya’s (name changed) childhood met an untimely demise sometime last week. A shy girl— not unlike Sapana, Inshiya was fairly regular in class. She might not have been a ” brilliant ” kid or not even “average” but what’s that got to do with any of this? This might just be my insecurity speaking, my inability to notice their considerable absences over the duration of the last month,  but shouldn’t every child have a right to childhood? But sadly, Inshiya had to “earn” it. And Kathmandu doesn’t care. They are busy fighting for, frankly, irrelevant issues as far as Nepal is concerned. Come on “feminists” and “feminazis” and equalists and all you NGOs mushrooming in the valley, help save these lives, not just the odd ones here and there for your yearly reports. 
16-year-old Priya is back “home” after a year of drunken beatings and hail pullings. With a false promise of allowing, yes ALLOWING! her to study. She was snatched away from her childhood by a culture that sees her as an object, a worthless burden, a machine to produce kids and cook meals. She was in grade 7.
These are not isolated cases. You see dead dreams in every other household in Dhanusha. This is the norm,  a culture. A culture that kills children.

https://kathmandutribune.com/bloodless-gadhimai-campaign-eyes-2024-to-make-the-festival-free-from-animal-sacrifices/,"KATHMANDU — It is well known that the Federation of Animal Welfare Nepal (FAWN) has been campaigning to end the mass animal sacrifice in Gadhimai Festival since its establishment. “Bloodless Gadhimai” – sacrifice blind faith, not animals, slogan was carried throughout the campaign, and different activities were organized in local area of Bara, Parsa and Rautahat district, India-Nepal border, provincial-level activities in State 2 and also in Central level to discourage the animal sacrifice aiming to stop the mass killing in Gadhimai festival. The campaign “Bloodless Gadhimai” is supported by the Humane Society International. 
FAWN was hopeful for the positive results from the campaign after considering the Supreme Court decision to discourage the ritual animal sacrifice in Nepal where the court directed Nepal Government bodies to take action to curb the animal sacrifice in the Gadhimai festival by bearing in mind the cultural sensitivity of the people.
FAWN partnered with different local organizations on the ground to implement the campaign activities including patrolling India-Nepal border to control animal movement and coordinated with the Department of Livestock Services, Maha Gadhimai Municipality, Festival Management Main Committee and District Administration Office of Bara where these government bodies committed to acting to discourage the animal sacrifice during the festival. After a series of efforts by FAWN, pre-festival decisions made by the committee was progressive where they made a written commitment not to sacrifice buffalo calves on the event, introducing Pigeon conservation program under the leadership of Mayor of Maha Gadhimai municipality, and supporting the Bloodless Gadhimai campaign in different local media as well. 
Despite all these efforts from FAWN, this year, bloodbath took place on the 3rd of December were around 200 unlicensed butchers slaughtered the buffaloes, including the calves in the slaughter arena of 13735 sq. m. which is around 200m from the temple. Butchers dramatically entered the arena and started the slaughter which continued for almost 5 hours. We are very much saddened to encounter this barbaric act in the 21st century where the century-old tradition of pleasing the goddess by forgoing other sentient beings surpasses the humane ideology of preventing cruelty. The post sacrifice head counting of dead buffaloes inside the arena carried by FAWN team members concluded with approximately 4000 buffaloes and tens of thousands of other small animals, especially goats and chickens. Regardless of all the promises made by those government bodies along with the Festival Management Main Committee, they all decided to continue the inhumane massacre and failed to keep the promises they made including protecting the buffalo calves. FAWN strictly condemns this brutal ritual massacre, which firmly challenged the verdict of the Supreme Court. 
FAWN will continue the anti-animal sacrifice campaign in the coming days and will extend to aware the people on different levels aiming to stop ritual killings and make the upcoming Gadhimai festival 2024 bloodless in real sense.

https://kathmandutribune.com/3-tips-on-how-to-travel-from-kathmandu-to-pokhara/,"3 Tips on How to travel from Kathmandu to Pokhara
When you plan to go for a trip or take a vacation in Nepal, there are hundreds of exotic and adventurous places that are a must-visit. And among them, Pokhara is now on the hit-list and the reasons are obvious. Want to enjoy a relaxing and rejuvenating vacation by the lake playing guitars or hanging out in lit bars? Pokhara is the place. Thinking of going on a fully adventurous trip and experience the adrenaline rush through sporty activities like mountaineering or base camp trekking, Pokhara is calling you!
How can I travel from Kathmandu to Pokhara?
Now that you have pinned the place on your “Must-Visit” travel map, you will certainly come across questions like “How do I get to Pokhara?” or “What are the fastest, convenient and affordable means of commute to reach Pokhara from Kathmandu?” or “Can I fly or hire a car to go there?”
You will find all these answers right here, so keep scrolling!
Kathmandu To Pokhara On Bus
Situated just 210km west of Kathmandu, Pokhara is accessible through all kinds of transport and one of the popular ways is via Tourist Bus. If you are not in a haste and want to enjoy a long bus ride, then traveling by tourist best will be the best option. The journey from Kathmandu to Pokhara by road is exhilarating, to say the least. It is a 200 km long stretch that consists of winding mountain roads and frequent changes in altitude and geography. Furthermore, it’s cheaper and more adventurous compared to flying.
More than 60 different travel agencies/ticket centers in Kathmandu operate tourist buses and provide you a decent value ticket to reach there. A standard tourist bus costs around US$8-US$12. On the contrary, if you want to get more comfortable on the wheels, we recommend you to go for Super Deluxe buses. They are fitted with all fancy amenities such as air conditioner/heater, wi-fi, television, and minibars. The bus fare is slightly expensive, ranging from Rs. 2000 to Rs 2500. It takes nearly 6-7hrs to reach Pokhara via buses.
Kathmandu to Pokhara on Flight
In case you want to reach Pokhara within half an hour and start your vacay right away, then this is the best tip for transportation for you. The flight only takes 25 minutes to land on Pokhara Airport and there are major airlines such as Yeti Airlines, Buddha Airlines, Shree Airlines, from where you can take an early domestic flight at Tribhuvan International Airport. The ticket prices vary as per the season, discounts and convenience. Standard local flight costs USD 45 per person while the foreign flight costs USD 125 per person (one-way ticket).
On a safety note, domestic airlines in TU can experience flight disruptions due to bad weather so it could be rescheduled. Also, the Pokhara airport can accompany only 8 small propeller-driven planes at one time and this can cause redirection to other airports.
Kathmandu to Pokhara on a Rental
Getting a rental and traveling on your own with maps calls for a different experience and adventure. You can find lots of car rental companies in Kathmandu that will provide you any car you want to, but it depends on its availability, so you have to book it a bit early to get hands-on your favorite wheels. 
Renting a car is pretty expensive, compared to buses or cheap flights. For instance, renting a Hyundai can cost you up to $90 to $150 and these are provided by private tour operators. Also, if you want to drive the car by yourself then you must submit a copy of your valid car license and fill up some forms or you will get a private tour guide/chauffeur for your safe journey.

https://kathmandutribune.com/mt-everest-should-be-advertised-for-its-base-camp-not-its-summit/,"The idea of reaching the summit of Mount Everest is recognized around the world as one of the greatest feats a human being can accomplish in nature. As of 2018, estimates were that some 4,000 people had ever made it to the summit since Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay became the first to do so. That may sound like a lot, but considering Hillary and Norway reached the summit in 1953, it works out to just over 60 people per year managing to climb the most famous mountain in the world.
Clearly the pure height and difficulty of Everest are its most unique features, so to speak. However, the argument can also be made that the exhaustive focus on its summit actually keeps the mountain from being advertised or recognized internationally as a place that can be enjoyed. Consider the following….
Online Content
When you look up the average world wonder – natural or man-made – you tend to get pages and pages of results about history, tourism recommendations, interesting new discoveries, and the like. Google “Stonehenge” and you’ll see guides, histories, facts, and theories; look up Victoria Falls and you’ll see videos, World Heritage Site listings, and tourist reviews. Search for places like the Amazon rainforest or the Great Barrier Reef and you’ll see more troubling results – but they’re at least meant to call attention to conservation needs.
When you look up Mount Everest, you’ll still see some basic facts, but you’ll also run into stories like this one, focusing on scary numbers about how many climbers perish trying to reach the summit. You might see news stories about the most recent deaths, or suggestions that you search for data on the same subject. Now, this is not intended to belittle those statistics, nor to make Everest seem safer than it is. Any attempt to reach the summit is extraordinarily dangerous and should be treated as such. However, the relentless focus on this single aspect of the destination does paint it in a different – and perhaps slightly unfair – light.
Video Games
World wonders don’t have quite as much of a presence in video games as one might expect, but when they do pop up here and there they tend to be approached playfully, or else almost mythologized. The Northern Lights, considered a natural wonder, are mimicked as a feature of a fantasy world in the popular game Skyrim: The Elder Scrolls. In Assassin’s Creed: Origins, the Egyptian pyramids are presented in all of their fantastic glory. The free pokies at New Zealand’s casino game platforms display places like the Nile River, the Sahara Desert, and the Roman Colosseum as fun, cartoonish slot reel backgrounds.
Mount Everest is seldom if ever presented in a similar fashion. It is instead, for the most part, left alone by the gaming industry altogether. Everest doesn’t have its own slot game or really any noteworthy online arcade. The closest we can think of to its appearing in a major console game would be in Far Cry 3, which takes place in a fictional Himalayan-esque land but only shows its highest mountains in the distance. Some Everest gaming experiences have emerged on virtual reality in recent years, but they’re almost more like virtual tours than games. It seems that for the most part the mountain – likely because it’s so closely associated with danger- isn’t viewed as suitable for more playful gaming content.
Film
Mount Everest does have a place in film – but here again, the focus is almost exclusively on how dangerous it is, or on people who are trying to make the summit. Perhaps the most well-known example – 2015’s Everest – is a dramatized true story about a climbing party caught in a fearsome blizzard. The Climb, a 2007 documentary, tells the story of Laurie Skreslet and Pat Morrow, the first Canadians to summit Everest, who did so again 25 years later – but it also covers the fact that four of their original fellow climbers died in the effort.
Again, we don’t mean to discount any of this information. The summit of Everest makes for a dangerous climb that only well-prepared experts should consider attempting, and even then it can be perilous. There’s no reason, however, for these factors to keep Everest out of pop culture and mainstream attention the way they seem to because there are ways of visiting the mountain that doesn’t entail trying to reach its peak.
Per this guide, as well as others, you do not have to be an expert to trek to the Everest base camp. While it’s not quite the pure feat that reaching the summit is, the base camp still makes for extraordinary achievement, a lifelong memory, and a good challenge. One does need to be in relatively good physical condition to make this trek, and thorough preparation is still in order. The danger is not entirely removed. But the base camp offers a more reasonable travel option that is far too often overlooked as all eyes naturally drift upward toward the peak.
We’re not suggesting a particular ad campaign from any particular entity. But it would be nice to see more travel sites and guides focus on the distinction, such that Everest could become more accessible, and perhaps present a more approachable face to the world.

https://kathmandutribune.com/kathmandus-air-pollution-is-killing-its-people-quietly/,"Air Pollution in Kathmandu continues to increase, unchecked. It is, thus, creating a climate crisis (emergency) for its denizens. Studies suggest that “Chronic exposure of deteriorated air increases the chance of Non-communicable Disease (NCD) like lung disease, heart disease, and cancers. Short term exposures also invite respiratory diseases and allergy.” The health impact of Kathmandu’s toxic air is already seen as Nepal is ranked 2nd in lung ailments deaths. Air pollution, today, has become one of the contributors to people dying from lung diseases despite the nation improving its average life expectancy to 72 years. Nepal’s government should make a move before health issues due to air pollution becomes a national burden.
 Dr. Sumi Mehta, Senior Epidemiologist for Vital Strategies Environmental Health division:
“Exposures to air pollution in Nepal are higher than the South Asia region as a whole. With the number of air pollution-related deaths in Nepal (more than 25,000 in 2017 alone) steadily increasing since 2010, air pollution has become a burning issue.
Effective policies to address the leading sources of pollution in Kathmandu, as well as the greater Kathmandu Valley region, are urgently needed.  This means continued efforts to mitigate longstanding sources of pollution, including cooking and/or heating with solid fuels, brick kilns, and open waste burning.  It also requires forward-thinking policies to ensure that the rapid increase in the mobile fleet does not result in increased vehicular emissions.   The country simply must ban other countries from allowing Nepal to be a dumping ground for vehicles and fuels they would not allow on their own roads”.
When analysts like Mehta say that exposures to air pollution in Nepal are higher than the South Asia region then it is mainly urban-centric as rural areas are way clearer than the capital city. Nepal’s government continues to allow the unabated sale of vehicles dependent on petrol and diesel. No wonder Nepal Oil Corporation is the number 1 taxpayer and the fuel comes from India. To decrease air pollution in the long-run, Nepal should decrease its dependency on petroleum and diesel. But this is not going to happen immediately.
A recent article by Nepali journalist Deepak Adhikari stated that Nepal stands to lose millions of money as India is likely to not agree on purchasing its electricity. The silver lining, however, is that Nepal could electrify the whole nation and pushes for electric vehicles and reduces its dependence on fossil fuels. On the other hand, the recently opened cross-border India-Nepal pipeline is going to make sure that Nepal continues to buy India’s oil, which largely depends on polluting refineries. Politically this appears to be a relationship mending project, but Kathmandu’s woe is only going to accelerate.
While winter is approaching, residents of Kathmandu are likely to face a smoggy, polluted valley as hospitals will be full-packed with air pollution-related patients. It is not just the vehicles that fail emission checkups that are contributing to air pollution. The roads in Kathmandu Valley are in a terrible state and are way dustier—which helps in increasing the harmful particulate matters and stays in the air for a longer period of time due to the valley’s bowl-like shape.
The numbers don’t lie and Kathmandu’s unchecked air pollution is killing its people slowly. The climate crisis is real and the concerned authorities need to pull up their sleeves and start working to detoxify the capital city for future generations. Perhaps, if nothing works, Nepal should move its capital to save the city from an impending disaster where the city would not be an ideal place to live anymore.

https://kathmandutribune.com/itinerant-plant-doctors/,"The history has some macabre past resulting due to plant disease. In absence of proper diagnosis and treatment of plant disease, a tiny but insidious fungus caused the ‘Irish famine’ and annihilated a large number of Irish Population in the late 18th Century. However, things have slowly changed after the green revolution, many farmers know dos and don’ts during an infestation of disease. Technologies have an advanced and new method of farming and pest management like the one: IPM has been developed and proper management of disease and pest are possible.
Every living creature on this earth suffers from the disease. Human express their disease suffering verbally, whereas plant could not so farmers through observation of expressed signs and symptoms access the disease, to his/her cognizance level about the disease and management technique a farmer apply that technique. However, sometimes some signs and symptoms of the disease are equivocal enough to elude the understanding of farmers, and thus the applied management technique efficacy diminishes. The perplexing signs and symptoms need a meticulous diagnosis to come to reach the conclusion fora recommendation of management techniques. In such a situation, the farmer can either visit the nearest agriculture service center to get expert advice or without proper consultation of experts–apply pesticides by contacting the nearest agro-vets.
Apart from the extension service through an agriculture service center, Plant Protection Directorate (PPD) has started a rapid and accurate way of diagnosing disease through Plant Clinic. To people who are oblivion about ‘Plant Clinic’–it is similar to the mobile human clinic, but the difference is, here, ill humans are not treated, but human for check-ups brings plants that are afflicted with pain for proper diagnosis. The trained extension officers who are referred “plant doctors” carry diagnosis and recommend the management techniques. If the disease symptoms could not be diagnosed promptly, the diseased part is sent to a laboratory for scrutiny so that the causation of disease could be established and farmers get the correct remedy.
In such a situation, the Plant Clinic that can provide rapid and maximum time correct diagnosis to the malady plant part can be handy.
A few days back ‘Plant Clinic’ was organized by the International Association of Students in Agriculture and Related Sciences (IAAS LC HICAST) in association with IDE Nepal. Plant clinic was uncanny to farmers—as they had never heard and visited the plant clinic it was first of the kind to them, as we had informed a day earlier about organizing plant clinic to local farmers; the enthusiastic farmers began queuing with the diseased parts from 11 am.  
Experience
A man in his thirties entered the plant clinic and headed towards my desk with disease-infected plants in his hand. I greeted him Namaste, and followed by a question: what is the problem? He asked for the medicine to obliterate the pest from his vegetable field, which was plaguing his plants from proper growth and development. I asked him what he used to do before to manage the pests. Doubt about my credence in his face, “ I would thoroughly spray and soak plants with the medicine to keep them at bay.” he replied, “ aakhir kira ra dhusi ta hataunu paryo ni, na vaye eutai ramro sanga falne haine.” While other “plant doctor” tried to explain to him that environment is full of insects and not all insects are harmful, his face revealed dissuaded and anguished, he asked, “How to know which is useful and harmful?” There are some insects which feed on pest and tries to balance the natural ecosystem, these useful insects ( by showing pictures) like ladybird beetle, spider, green lacewings, tiger beetle, etc should be preserved. The natural enemies maintain the balance of the ecosystem and are crucial for limiting the population of the pest. He seemed disaffected perhaps because he did not get the medicine he was expecting. I doubt if he is growing vegetables this year.
Many farmers still believe that when the plants are infected with pests they need medicine to protect, but actually, the medicine they think they are using is not a medicine but is a pesticide that kills or suppresses the population of pests and helps the plant grow and develop without hindrance. Since pesticides are poison if they are improperly handled, they may cause grave consequences to human health.
The belief system of many farmers of treating pesticide as panacea needs a paradigm shift and this is only possible through proper dissemination of knowledge on pests, pesticides and biological control agents.
Decreasing is increasing
The key to increasing productivity is decreasing the losses of the crop yield. Yearly, plant diseases, pests, and weeds are estimated to cause a loss of up to 40 percent. This is a huge loss in terms of monetary value and total productivity. If we curb the loss even by the slightest percent, the total could increase and the production from our farmlands could be enough to feed our people. However, saying such it all depends on farmers to apply the recommended technique.
The disease is inevitable, but the choice of what to use and shun during disease infestation is in the farmer’s hand. Haphazard use of chemicals without proper deliberation on using pesticides can turn costly—both environmentally and on farmer-plant health condition, due to less sophisticated techniques applied to diagnose plant disease the cost incurred to diagnose the plant disease is cheap, genuine, accurate and advice are highly useful. The extension in the plant clinic stresses on pragmatic IPM approach and the use of chemicals as the last resort of management.

https://kathmandutribune.com/nepal-how-to-improve-it-security-of-an-organization-and-protect-from-hackers/,"The recent news about Chinese hackers being able to break the Payment system in Nepal and being able to withdraw millions of rupees has revealed the vulnerability of the Information System in Nepalese banks. IT security has been a major focus for every organization around the world with the number of increasing new and emerging risks. Banks have always a high hack value and recent data shows that banks of Asia Pacific have been a major target for hackers around the globe. The reason being IT security technologies and processes needs huge investment and banks in the Asia Pacific haven’t really taken it as a priority.
 IT system hack and data breach not only causes monetary and reputational loss but the organization also loses the trust with its customers and partners. Additionally, the regulatory body can impose a huge fine because of which organization may come in a verge of collapse. One of the instances is Equifax, which experienced a massive data breach in 2017, and US regulatory body imposed $575 million fine. The main accusation to Equifax was “failure to take reasonable steps to secure its network which led to a data breach”.
Mainly IT Threat can be seen as external and internal:

External Threat: Threat that happens from outside the organization from hackers, crackers or even state-sponsored attacks 
Internal Threat: Threat within an organization from employees intentionally or unintentionally and social engineering

For any organization, to understand IT risk it is important to understand the Risk on the basis of Threat and Vulnerability model. Below is the definition of risk as per threat and vulnerability model:
Risk = Asset + Threat + Vulnerability
 Asset = People, property, and information
 Threat – Anything that can exploit the vulnerability, intentionally or accidentally, and obtain, damage, or destroy an asset.
 Vulnerability – Weaknesses or gaps in a security program that can be exploited by threats to gain unauthorized access to an asset.
To mitigate the new and emerging risks, any organization should address the vulnerabilities as soon as it is revealed. If the vulnerabilities cannot be addressed, there must be sufficient key and compensating controls to convert the risk from inherently high to residually low. Below are some of the technologies and processes that can be implemented to beef-up the information security posture of any organization: 

Patching Cycle: Every system used and implemented should be updated to the latest stable release. Patches, update and upgrade help system to address existing vulnerabilities and fix the bugs. For eg. Microsoft releases Windows updates on second Tuesday of every month, these updates should be pushed out to all systems like Desktop, Servers, ATM Machines, and Kiosk, etc. to address the vulnerabilities. Along with Windows update, any appliances, network devices firmware, and third party software should be regularly patched. 
Use of Firewall: Firewall has capabilities to analyze network traffic and allow legitimate traffic and block the unwanted traffic as per the policies. The best practice is to design two layers of Firewall as external and internal. External Firewall blocks all unwanted traffic coming and leaving the organization to the outside world whereas internal Firewall blocks traffic within the different systems/Vlans of the organization as per the policies.
Use of Antivirus: Antivirus is the last point of defense which protect endpoints for any malware, viruses, and spyware. Antivirus must be implemented on all endpoint and the virus definition must be updated as it is released to get the latest protection.
Zero-day Protection: Zero-day threat has no patches released on the day so they can be harmful to the organization. To mitigate Zero-day Threat, Zero-day protection tools must be implemented for email, network and endpoints. For example, Zero-day protection tool will open the email attachments and links in a sandbox and analyze the effect before it is actually sent to end-user. 
Email Security: The main source of Virus, Spyware, malware, ransomware, etc. is email. Hackers can target end-user sending Phishing /spam email and also impersonating email being sent as one of the colleagues or seniors. To protect from this threat, email gateway should be implemented which analyzes the email and block spams and phishing emails. Email gateway can provide Email Security, Automated Redaction and Sanitization, anti-spam and phishing and Virus scanner which helps to mitigate most of the threats that come through email.
Vulnerability Management: All the assets of the organization should be periodically scanned against the vulnerabilities using specialized vulnerability management tool, which will list out any serious, high or medium vulnerabilities in the system. Serious and high vulnerabilities should be addressed as soon as possible. Old vulnerabilities have bigger threat vector as the attacker would already devise many ways to exploit it. Examples of vulnerability management tool are Alien Vault Unified Security management, Comodo HackerProof, Tripwire IP360, etc.
End of Support Life System: Attackers can easily exploit the system, which has passed the end of support life, as there is no update/patches released by the vendor. So, End of Support life system is always vulnerable to the organization and this system must be replaced with newer releases.
Two-factor authentication: Using two-factor authentication protects the system even the first authentication medium (password) is compromised. The attacker will still need another level of authentication which can be a code sent to a mobile device or email or can be a secure ID token. 
Data leakage Prevention: Data is the most important asset for any organization. Data must be classified based on the content on the data, which can be restricted, confidential or public. Data leakage prevention technology protects data from leaking out from the organization intentionally or unintentionally DLP technology can protect data from being sent to the printer, copied to a removable device or being uploaded using FTP or https. Example of DLP solution includes Force Point DLP Solution, Symantec DLP Solution, and Check Point DLP Solution, etc.
Data Encryption: Confidential and restricted data must be encrypted so that only authorized user with the key is able to view and make changes in the data. Data encryption assures confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive data. Data encryption can be done user-based or group based as per the need and nature of the data.
Use of FIM and SIEM: FIM (File Integrity Monitoring) FIM provides another layer of data security by monitoring file s and system providing valuable insight to the technical environment. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) SEIM provides security teams to triage events and perform investigations. It provides a single point of collection for all potential security threats. Implementation of FIM and SEIM gives the capability of security investigation and monitoring in case of data breach or attacks.
Penetration tests: Penetration test is conducting a hack of own system in a controlled environment, Penetration test results give an insight into the vulnerabilities of the Information systems. Penetration testing/scanning must be conducted on a regular basis and vulnerabilities and gaps must be addressed to secure the environment. 
DDOS Prevention: Distributed Denial of Service attack comprises of sending multiple requests to a service or network using multiple compromised systems distributed geographically apart. DDOS attack will exhaust the capability of a system to process the request and it will be not able to process legitimate request. Different DDOS prevention tool such as F5 Networks, Aruba networks, Black Lotus, etc. can be implemented to prevent DDOS attacks.
Privilege Management: Access to critical System must be classified based on the roles and permission of the user such as read-only, read/write or execute. Access to the database, network devices must be separated and restricted for the users based on the policies which will protect the system from unauthorized changes in the system. Access to such a system can be also permitted based on time-based tokens.
  HIPS: Host-based Intrusion Prevention System can analyze system calls, application logs, and file-system modifications (binaries, password files, capability databases, and access control lists) with the help of the database. HIPs. Once the malicious activity is detected HIPS can alert the specified user and log the event for investigation.
 MDM and VPN: All mobile devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops must be enrolled in mobile device management so that policies can be set to secure the devices. For example, if the mobile device is lost or compromised, the administrator can remotely wipe the device using the management console. 

Remote access to the network and system for mobile users must be allowed through secured VPN (Virtual Private Networks) so that there is no need of using vulnerable third-party tools.

 Web application Firewall: WAF can protect web application based on the policies set by the administrator. This is an additional layer of Firewall in the application level. For example, an administrator can also set custom policies such as blocking the traffic from high-risk countries. 
 URL Filtering: Internet is another source for viruses, malware, and other different risks. Use of URL Filtering can restrict the traffic in and out the organization based on the allowed categories, file types, and custom policy groups. URL filtering can be a part of the firewall implemented in the organization.
 Educating employees about different IT Risks: Providing training and educating staffs from different threats is very useful in mitigating the risk, for example, education staff about phishing/spam email and how to identify them can minimize the chances of staff clicking on spam/phishing email links.

In conclusion, there is no system in the world, which is zero vulnerable, and without any risk. But implementing the above technologies and process greatly reduces the risk from different threats. Investing in IT security is better than later ending up paying hefty fines to regulatory bodies and losing the money and reputation from the attacks.

https://kathmandutribune.com/petro-dollar-china-diplomacy-and-strategic-trade-route/,"Saurav Raj Pant
China is rising and rising. Yet, China faces some key challenges which may halt its ambitions for becoming a sole international player. To become key international player, one of the significant factor is to overtake is on oil independency. Petro-dollar politics is very complicated. So, China should be independent of oil production. China dependency on oil from Saudi Arabia is a big problem. It imports a considerable amount of oil from Saudi Arabia including Iran. As per Forbes, China’s crude oil imports numbered at around 9.5 million bpd of which Russia held the largest share at 16%, followed by Saudi Arabia 12%, Iraq at 11% and Angola at 9%. China imports around 43% from the Middle East via Strait of Hormuz and 82% of all Chinese oil imports passes through the Strait of Malacca. Strait of Hormuz—where the US naval base is present; is protecting the US vested interest and Arab security umbrella. This has been the 1st strategic blockage for China. If the US-China partnership shattered at an international level, the US-led bloc could use this strategic route to block China’s key imports i.e. Oil.  China should address its key challenges in distributing its coal reserves to the consumers of the Southeast coastal provinces and cities; which is available in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Guizhou. The transportation price is higher to bring coal from Shanxi to Southeast coastal provinces but China needs to adjust this for limiting its dependency on international products.  Such unaddressed challenges push China to rely on foreign countries for oil—this could be a bargaining chip for limiting China’s rise. 
The second blockage in international trade is in the Strait of Malacca; surrounded by Malaysia and Singapore. Both are close to the US. These two strategic blockages (Strait of Malacca and Strait of Hormuz) could be a geopolitical battleground for China and the US; if BRI comes in action. BRI also uses the maritime route of the South China Sea, Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Sea. The US —already under the Indo-Pacific Strategy is building Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Australia, US, India, and Japan) —naval base to protect and protect the US-led vested interest possibly countering the passage of goods of China under BRI. 
Economic aspect
Next, to it, China should able to negotiate effectively on the ongoing trade talks with the US. Escalating trade war could potentially make the ASEAN countries to exploit the US market directly; which has been exploited by China earlier. The US is a huge consumer market and if one country’s production is costlier; another secondary market step in. 
China’s ever-increasing international engagement in trade and politics could also impact the western countries to re-strengthen the western security alliance created after 1945 under the leadership of the US. This possibly makes the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment (TTIP) is a prime example.  TTIP has been negotiating back door of the EU parliament despite rejection from the several EU NGOs claiming it would increase corporate hegemony over Europe. But, if the western led multilateralism faces a tough time from China; TTIP becomes unstoppable. TTIP is one of the largest deals ever which could increase the size of the EU economy by 120 billion Euros and the US by $95 billion.  The two largest economic centers of the world EU and the US if happen to be combining; the global economic landscape could be dangerous. All the global wealth might forcefully be concentrated on the EU and the US market. So, underlining this; China should also prepare something coercive economic club against TTIP combining ace actors of Asia. 
Way forward
Firstly, China should able to be vocal and increase its media engagements globally. As per data currently, the majority of the global media is controlled by the American businessman. This could propagate anti-Chinese propaganda globally which might affect global investors to invest in China. As still, the US is the largest FDI receiving countries ($311 billion) followed by China ( $144 billion). It has been observed that China for the last 10 years has been engaged in economic expansion globally but has limitations ineffective diplomatic engagement. In contrast, western countries have a deeper diplomatic engagement globally; promoting and protecting their vested interest perfectly. Diplomatic engagement has the power to maneuver both politics and society in a deep manner. So, the Chinese establishment should initiate a project like ‘Diplomacy First’ likewise BRI. This initiative would focus on China’s improving diplomatic maneuver and protecting and promoting her vested interest.

Saurav Raj Pant 
Visibility in foreign affairs is a must. Nepal’s visibility in foreign affairs policy around the globe has changed drastically in PM K.P. Oli premiership. In these few months, four foreign policy events had effectively impacted Nepal.  US-China increasing proxy war in Nepal, John Bolton’s jokingly mention about Nepal & Iranian non-resident ambassador visit to Kathmandu, Indo-Pacific strategy report released by Defense Department & Prime Minister’s Europe trip is the 4 major foreign policy events. But, the report had suggested to us that, Nepal is under deeper foreign policy challenges of the decade because of these events. 


US-China proxy war in Nepal  


Several events prove that US-China proxy war in Nepal kick-started. In Feb 2018, the US Assistant Secretary caution Nepal in regards to receiving financial support/loan for BRI and deporting of American nationals from Nepal in recently (based on the request of the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu). Such an event makes both friends hostile and puts us in the dilemma. A proxy war is dangerous. We have been seeing the consequences of proxy war in the world. In the case of Afghanistan, it was the US & Soviet Union, For Syria, it is the US & Russia, For Palestine, it is Israel, the US & Arab world. All these proxies war has not been profited to the third party state— where the proxy is carried out. 


John Bolton’s joking mention about Nepal & non-resident Iranian Ambassador


In May 2019 during Abu Dhabi Summit, John Bolton jokingly mentions about Nepal referring to the UAE oil tanker attack by quoting “It’s clear that Iran is behind the Fujairah attack. Who else would you think would be doing it? Someone from Nepal?” Analyzing this statement, how could John Bolton mention about ‘Nepal’? Does Nepal remain the core foreign policy topic for the Trump administration or could Nepal be able to facilitate the US interest in the potential Iran-US conflict? It is tough to analyze. Does he meet any Nepali official before attending this summit? It is also not clear. In June 2019, following this event of Nepal connection with Iran; Iranian Non-Resident Ambassador Dr. Ali Chegeni holds a meeting with Nepali Foreign Minister (F.M.) Mr. Pradeep Gyawali.  Although his meeting with Nepali F.M. was planned to submit a copy of his credentials Ambassador Chegeni became Incumbent Ambassador of Iran to India on the 7th December 2018 and he had submitted his credentials to Nepali on June 2019.  So, these 8 months gap period in diplomacy matters and his arrival right after the Bolton jokingly mention about Nepal is also very much crucial.  In diplomacy what has been done in reference to what context at what time matters the most. Following these events, we should able to articulate, what’s going on the global politics regarding political dynamics of Iran-US. 


U.S. Department of Defense report on “Indo-Pacific Strategy”


The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) released a report on “Indo-Pacific Strategy” sub-titled “Preparedness, Partnership and promoting a networked region”.  This report outlines a comprehensive approach of promoting the US interest in the Indo-pacific region. It fundamental focus on China, Russia & North Korea as the transnational threats is worth mention.  In this report, DoD seeks to expand its defense relationship with Nepal under the ‘State Partnership Program in the Indo-Pacific’.  We should be clear. This strategy is specially designed to counter China, Russia, and North Korean in the Indian & Pacific Ocean Region. Here, China is our immediate neighbor. Any possible sign of our participation in this covert strategy or promoting the US vested interest could prove ‘double aged sword’ for us as it will derail our long historical relationship with China. We should build a counter-strategy to deal with this issue diplomatically behind the closed doors of Washington & Kathmandu. Publicizing, such crucial geopolitical issues in the streets of Kathmandu won’t show our diplomatic and foreign affairs maturity. 


 Prime Minister’s Europe trip 


Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli left for Europe for an eight days trip in the month of June. In Switzerland, he had only addressed the 100th anniversary of the International Labour Organization (ILO) on June 10, 2019. Then, he went to hold a bilateral meeting with the Lame Duck British Prime Minister Theresa May on June 11th, 2019.  In the Joint UK-Nepal communiqué, both sides acknowledge the long and distinguished service of Gurkhas. But underlining the PM Oli statement after arriving in Nepal, he had said the UK side didn’t accept the proposal of renewing/reviewing the Tripartite agreement made among, Nepal, India & UK in 1947 for Gurkhas recruitment. Our trip to Britain became little distasteful as our PM faced appointment problem (for the leader of the country whose country has 203 years of historical relationship with the UK) with the queen of the UK. In France, no joint statement was released neither French President Emmanuel Macron hold a meeting our Prime Minister. 
Way forward
In these above four foreign policy events, it had exposed our vulnerabilities in dealing with the changing global political dynamics. We have been failing to settle the rapidly growing proxy war in Nepal between China-US initiated by the issues of Belt & Road Initiatives (BRI) or magnify footprint of the US as an Indo-Pacific strategy. We should learn from the impact of proxy war carried out in the world. We embrace our democratic principles, foreign policy guiding principles, and governance system. Under such a framework, we believe in neutrality.
John Bolton ‘jokingly’ mention about Nepal to relate it with the UAE Oil tanker attack sounds ‘not so funny’ in the context of brewing tension of the US-Iran. But every steps and word has a special meaning in diplomacy. Right after such statement; Iranian Ambassador based in New Delhi who is also the diplomatic charge of Nepal meeting with Nepali F.M is no co-incidence. We should extract the body language of the Ambassador and his concern about Nepal’s on any sort of dealing with the US against Iran. In this case, it would have been better if Nepal assured Iran about zero tolerance towards anti-Iranian activities from the Nepali soil.
Nepal’s mute position on DoD report about Indo-Pacific strategy has created a suspicious environment and lessening public trust towards the government. Nepal government should immediately release a Press-Statement on this matter. 
PM Oli Europe trip is although a good start by such powerful P.M but seems lesser homework done to prepare this trip. Nepali side met with Lame Duck Prime Minister Theresa May; who is about to replaced by the new Prime Minister and French PM( In France, Prime Minister is not executive). Both these meetings with the UK & France reflect our limitations in high-level diplomatic dealing at a time when Asia is rising and becoming the neighbor of the two largest emerging giants; it is noticeable that where we are heading. We should clear fully analyze; how could such a high-level visit be successful if we weren’t able to manage to hold a meeting with the head of the government/state. After this trip, the questions are obvious whether our friends started ignoring us. 
Anyway, all these foreign policy mishaps should be taken as the ‘lesson learning’. Every country has a ‘better and sustained’ foreign policy followed by the dark foreign policy management. These 4 foreign policy events now advised us to disseminate a ‘White Paper’ on our current foreign policy status as we do for our economic policy. White Paper will guide us where we are, what went wrong and policy guidance to solve the foreign policy challenges of our generation. Let us remember that, nothing is ‘perfect’ in an initial stage; the only thing that requires is ‘effort’ to make it ‘perfect’.

https://kathmandutribune.com/risk-of-israeli-iranian-war-still-looms-high/,"This article is a short excerpt from my latest essay, Preventing an Israeli-Iran War, published in the May 2019 issue of American Diplomacy. The full-length essay is available here [http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/].
Accusing Iran of being a rogue country bent on acquiring nuclear weapons, supporting extremist groups and terrorism, persistently threatening Israel, and destabilizing the region in its relentless effort to become the dominant power may well all be justified. The question is, what would it take to stop Iran from its destabilizing activities and help make it a constructive member of the international community, and avoid a military confrontation with either the US or Israel or both?
The answer is not regime change, as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and top American officials advocate, but a diplomatic solution. The EU, led by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom – who continue to adhere to the JCPOA – should initiate a behind-the-scenes dialogue and pave the way for US involvement in a negotiating process with Iran to find a peaceful solution and prevent a disastrous military confrontation.
Should the Trump administration remain adamant on regime change, it is more than likely that one of the following scenarios will unfold, which could lead to a catastrophic development.
The bellicose narrative leads to violence: The threats and counter-threats between Iran and Israel could lead to miscalculation, resulting in an unintended outbreak of a catastrophic war that neither side wants nor can win. As it continues to escalate, such narratives also create a public perception both in Israel and Iran that military confrontation may well be inevitable. As a result, both countries would become entrapped by their bellicose narrative against one another, in which any incident perceived to threaten the national security of either side could trigger a devastating military confrontation.
Rhetoric like the statements by a senior Revolutionary Guard commander, declaring on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Iranian revolution that “if they [the United States] attack us, we will raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground”, and Netanyahu’s response that if Iran attempts such an attack, it will fail and “…this would be the last anniversary of the revolution that they celebrate”, should be avoided.
Attacks in Syria spark further conflict: Israel’s continuing attacks on Iranian military installations in Syria, from which Iran has sustained heavy losses, could pressure Iran to retaliate as it will no longer allow itself to be humiliated now that these attacks are in the open. Iran’s tendency to overly exaggerate its military prowess, which it has come to believe in, and Israel’s psychologically rooted fear of existential threats narrows the space of reasonable discourse.
The problem here is that Israel’s determination not to allow Iran to establish permanent military bases in Syria, and conversely Tehran’s resolve not to cut its losses and leave, shortens the time before an outright military confrontation could occur. These conditions are further aggravated by Trump’s support of Netanyahu’s military campaign against Iran in Syria, bringing Israel and Iran ever closer to the precipice of war.
Effecting regime change in Iran: Trump’s desire to effect regime change – by imposing sanctions to dislocate the Iranian economy and instigate public unrest, while trying to isolate Iran internationally – could create chaotic conditions in the country, but it does not guarantee that regime change will, in fact, be realized. Unlike the US’ successful attempt in 1953 to topple the then-Mosaddeq government, in today’s Iran, the clergy is far more entrenched in every aspect of life.
Although Iranians are suffering and ordinary people take a serious personal risk by demonstrating against the government and demanding change, this public pressure is not enough to unseat the government, as the Trump administration is hoping for. It does, however, push the government to search for new avenues to alleviate the worsening economic conditions.
The mullahs have shown an inordinate capacity to ruthlessly quell any public unrest, and it can count on the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to safeguard the survival of the clergy because in protecting the mullahs, the Guard protects its own elite position. This mutuality of interests and dependency explains why the clergy allocates a significant portion of Iran’s national budget to the Guard, regardless of the overall economic hardship from which the public suffers.
Waging a premeditated war against Iran: This is the worst option of all, as there is simply no way to predict the ultimate outcome. To suggest, as some Israelis do, that a surgical attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities carried out jointly by the US and Israel will not necessarily evolve into a regional war displays a clear lack of understanding of the Iranian psychological and political disposition. Regardless of cost, Iran will retaliate against US targets and allies in the region, which could plunge the Middle East into a devastating war from which no one will escape unscathed.
Given the fact that no war could obliterate Iran, and Israel’s low threshold for casualties, any Iranian attack on Israel in the course of a war that results in the death of thousands of Israelis while inflicting massive destruction may well force Israel to resort to the use of WMDs. This option becomes even more realistic should Israel conclude with certainty that Iran is posing an imminent existential threat. For this reason, no sane Israeli or American should even contemplate a premeditated war and must stop short of nothing to prevent an accidental one.
The February 2019 Warsaw conference revealed disunity and disagreement between the US and its allies in addressing the Iran problem. Although it was ostensibly convened to address the crises sweeping the Middle East, the focus quickly shifted to Iran, which was the intent of the US in the first place. The Trump administration wanted to rally the international community behind its confrontational policy toward Iran, to which the European countries objected, as was manifested by the low-level delegations they sent to the conference.
For Iran, this display of disunity provided it the opportunity to take full advantage of the Western alliance’s discord and trade with many other countries to compensate for American sanctions. However, the EU must make it clear to Tehran that it cannot count on the discord to last indefinitely. Conversely, Germany, France, and the UK ought to persuade the US that its confrontational approach will not work. Secretary of State Pompeo’s unabashed statement that “you can’t achieve stability in the Middle East without confronting Iran”, a position that Netanyahu echoed the day after, will only heighten the tension and draw them ever closer to a military confrontation.
The EU must initiate behind-the-scenes negotiations with Iran, if it hasn’t already, and along with the US, develop and agree upon a joint cohesive strategic plan to mitigate the conflict with Iran based on the carrot-and-stick approach. The new negotiations should be based on quid pro quo aiming to achieve a comprehensive deal in stages to enhance mutual credibility and build trust.
Every conflicting issue must be placed on the table and a solution to any such issue, for example, an agreement on freezing Iran’s research and development of ballistic missiles, is reciprocated by lifting a specific set of sanctions from which Iran can derive immediate benefit. To be sure, Western powers should offer Iran a path for normalization of relations, removing sanctions, and assurances that the West will not seek regime change.
In return, Iran must stop meddling in the affairs of other states, supporting extremist groups such as Hezbollah, threatening Western allies, and waging proxy wars in Yemen and Syria while undermining their geostrategic interests. Moreover, Iran must provide a full account of the history of its nuclear weapons and present all information pertaining to its nuclear facilities and equipment, as was uncovered by the archives seized by Israel, along with the technology and materials that it has hidden from the international monitors.
This kind of cooperation and high level of transparency will serve the objective of reaching regional stability from which Iran can benefit greatly, instead of continuing its nefarious activities which invite condemnation, sanctions, and potentially war.
Pierre Vimont, a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe, observes that “These different challenges all boil down to the issue of a regional security arrangement for the whole region. Highly ambitious indeed, but the response to the current mistrust between Iran and its neighbors can only come from a clear perspective of where this whole region should be heading to ensure sustainable stability.”
There is nothing in the current crises with Iran that cannot be resolved through negotiations. But the continuing threats and counter-threats will gain increasing traction and make the risk of waging a war preferable to the consequences of allowing Iran to continue its destructive behavior.

https://kathmandutribune.com/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-erdogans-era/,"The result of the recent municipal elections in Turkey represents a major shift in public sentiment toward President Erdogan, which will have major political ramifications that will bring him down in disgrace. It is true that the economic crisis and the ineptitude he exhibited in dealing with it played an important role in the election and the AKP’s devastating losses in the largest cities, especially his hometown of Istanbul. There are, however, other major factors that have directly contributed to public disgust with his ruthless one-man rule. The local elections provided the first expression of the public outrage that has been building up for the past several years, during which he reversed the most significant socio-political and judicial achievements while systematically dismantling what’s left of Turkey’s democracy.
For Erdogan, a democratic form of government could not serve his ambition to become the absolute leader who can both shape Turkey’s destiny as an Islamic state and serve as the head of the Sunni Muslim world. As he once stated, “democracy is like a bus, once you reach your destination you get off.” Following the failed military coup, which he accused his staunch nemesis Fethullah Gülen of orchestrating, he dismissed some 125,800 public officials and subjected nearly 446,000 to harsh interrogation.
In an unprecedented crackdown, 17,000 women with over 700 small children have been jailed and subjected to torture. He systematically persecuted the country’s Kurdish community while denying them their basic human rights. Moreover, he shut down nearly 130 television channels, radio stations, newspapers, magazines, and publishing houses, and arrested 231 journalists. His purges have inflicted suffering on more than a million and a half people whose family members were targeted by Erdogan.
To be sure, Erdogan made Turkey a police state. Ordinary Turks are terrified of the unfolding abuse as he robbed not only their freedom but their dignity. It was under this environment that the recent elections were held, and the result, not surprisingly, reflected the public’s outrage.
The changing political winds have weakened Erdogan considerably, and as a result, the opposition parties became emboldened to challenge Erdogan. Other than voters’ fatigue with the AKP, the opposition parties, namely the CHP and the Kurdish HDP, joined forces and took full advantage of the public’s dissatisfaction with how Erdogan dealt with the economic crisis. Even though they received hardly any coverage in the media, they were still able to make huge inroads in the election.
Erdogan’s former political rival and current coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, has become very influential with Erdogan and his government, as the coalition is critical for Erdogan to maintain his razor-thin majority in the parliament. This shift in the political dynamic is a sign that Erdogan’s firm hold on power is eroding, and there seems to be no prospect that Erdogan will regain the public trust that he wantonly betrayed.
Erdogan portrays himself as a devout Muslim. As far back as December 1997, he was imprisoned for his public statement equating Islam to a military crusade, citing a poem that states in part: “The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets, and the believers our soldiers.” He exploits his religious “credentials” to portray himself as a pious man and uses religion as a political tool as he is determined to convert Turkey into a conservative Muslim state.
To that end, he pursued an aggressive Islamic agenda to instill in the public consciousness that their overall well-being is directly linked to their being devout Muslims. He undertook the building of hundreds of mosques and religious educational institutions, not only in Turkey but in the Balkan states, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and even some European countries.
Being that overall the Turks are far more Western-oriented, Erdogan’s increased attempts to insert Islam into society and politics is resented as it runs contrary to the public’s belief that being a Muslim can go hand-in-hand with Western culture. The public holds Erdogan responsible for and resents the fact that he forfeited the opportunity to make Turkey an EU member.
In addition, Erdogan is bent on reviving many elements of the Ottoman Empire using soft power to influence the policies and the direction of the many countries that were once dominated by the Ottomans. His former prime minister Davutoglu once told me that by 2023, the hundredth anniversary of the new Republic of Turkey, Turkey will exert as much influence on these states as the Ottoman Empire did in its heyday.
To instill images of the Ottoman era, he built for himself a 1, 150-room presidential palace. Against the will of the people in Istanbul, he went ahead and converted a large section of Taksim Square into a huge mall that includes one of the largest mosques, designed architecturally to reflect the Ottoman period. The heavy investments that Erdogan made to promote his illusionary revival of the Ottoman era greatly disillusioned even some of his ardent followers, for whom bread-and-butter issues are far more critical, especially when the economy is limping and is unlikely to recover any time soon.
Furthermore, for Erdogan, the close alliance with the West has become an obstacle to realize his national aspiration, and he made a conscious decision to distance himself from his allies. Discarding Turkey’s critical alliance with the US, he incarcerated Rev. Brunson and used him unsuccessfully as a bargaining chip to force the US to release Fethullah Gülen. Erdogan was and still is determined to crush the Syrian Kurds (YPG), the US’ closest ally in the fight against ISIS, and to establish a permanent foothold in Syria to which the US sternly objects, which further strained the relationship with the US.
He defied fellow NATO members by purchasing a sophisticated air defense system from the West’s staunchest adversary, Russia, potentially compromising the US’ military technology. US Army General and NATO commander Curtis Scaparrotti told the Senate in March: “My best military advice would be that we don’t then follow through with the F-35—flying it or working with an ally that is working with Russian systems, particularly air defense systems, with one of our most advanced technological capabilities.”
Turkey under Erdogan never fully committed to the letter of NATO. Erdogan refused as a NATO member to meet its principal requirement, which is full adherence to democracy and human rights. Most Turks view Turkey’s growing distance from the West as a major setback for their country that will not be reversed as long as Erdogan remains in power.
Erdogan’s growing closeness to Putin is alarming for most Turks who believe that Putin is for Putin, and would do anything to undermine US’ interest in the Middle East, weaken the US-EU alliance, and destabilize NATO. Coopting Erdogan is a part of Putin’s sinister scheme. Working closely with Iran’s leader, along with Putin, in the search for a solution to the Syrian crisis and deliberately excluding the US from the process offers another glaring example of how far Erdogan will go to defy his Western allies.
Some say that the result of the local elections is indeed harmful to Erdogan politically but will not undermine him in the long run. I disagree. Given the public dismay and resentment of his brutal governing, the beginning of the end of Erdogan’s era has begun and his downfall is all but sealed; the only question is how soon.

https://kathmandutribune.com/one-last-prayer-white-supremacy/,"Nafiul Alam Shupto
White supremacy or white nationalism is the racist belief that white people are superior to people of other races and therefore should be dominant over them. The recent mass shooting of Muslim worshippers in New Zealand shook the entire world, was a devastating & tragic symptom of the growing threat posed by violent white supremacy across the world. People around the world are praying for the dead in Christchurch after the terrorist attacks at two mosques but thoughts and prayers are not really enough. These attacks are the latest manifestation of a growing and globalized ideology of white nationalism.
74- page manifesto and social media posts by the attacker was noticed & if those are to be believed, he was inspired by a thriving online ideological structure that recruits and radicalizes mostly men to save “Western civilization” from foreign invasion. This gives us another reason to think about the growing nationalist ideology in western civilization, right? Similarly, it was noticed before in a 1500-page manifesto by the Norwegian called Anders Breivik, who posted before he killed 77 people in 2011. The attack was conducted by the perpetrator just to punish Europe for its multiculturalism and policy of welcoming Muslim immigrants. In his manifesto, the attacker of the mosques in Christchurch, who referred to himself as a “regular white man,” wrote that he was carrying out the attack to directly reduce immigration rates by intimidating and physically removing the invaders themselves. The manifesto reveals an obsession with white supremacy, discussing the Battle of Vienna in 1683, which is glorified by white nationalists and Mr. Breivik as the critical moment when Europe staved off the Ottoman Empire’s advance and protected itself from Islam. Text scrawled on the gunman’s weapons appears to refer to military battles such as the 1189 Siege of Acre, a victory for the Christian Crusaders seeking to retake Jerusalem from Muslims. He mentioned Alexandre Bissonnette, who shot and killed six people in a Quebec mosque in 2017 and was a known white nationalist with anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim resentment. Among the white nationalists’ major motivators is “The great replacement” conspiracy theory. They fear that Jews, blacks and Muslims will replace white people and eventually subordinate them. Jews are often viewed as the diabolical head of the cabal, the nerve center, who use their infinite wealth and power to reduce and weaken the white man.
Having said that, white nationalism has taken firm root in both European and American political mainstreams. In Europe, white nationalists have gained political traction and influenced elections and referendums, including the United Kingdom’s 2016 Brexit vote while in the US, President Donald Trump and numerous Republican politicians have been linked to white supremacy. If the idea that Muslims are a threat sounds familiar, it’s in part because it was used by President Trump to argue for a wall to protect America from a “caravan” of Central American migrants seeking asylum. He asserted that “Middle Easterners” were in the caravan, a claim he admitted he could not back up. Furthermore, an Australian senator, Fraser Anning, responded to the Christchurch attack by blaming the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.
Hence it’s clear that the dangers of white nationalism have become global. Christchurch attack is a reminder that this dangerous ideology also threatens immigrant communities worldwide, and that it’s fueled by leaders around the world.  It’s the global ideology of white nationalism and white supremacy. We have to take it seriously, and call out politicians, academics and media personalities who give it a platform under the guise of exploring both sides, fostering debate or avoiding political correctness. The shooter in New Zealand was not born to hate Muslims or any other minority group. They were taught, just as all other white supremacist terrorists are taught, via bigoted discourses which have attained hegemonic status in western societies.  
So can it be said that the white supremacy or white nationalism has taken away the lives of 49 worshipers who should have returned home to their families instead of attending their last prayer?

https://kathmandutribune.com/defeating-malaria-demands-high-impact-country-led-and-owned-approaches/,"
By Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia
With the world at a crossroads in the quest to defeat malaria, the WHO South-East Asia Region stands tall. Between 2015 and 2017 the Region reduced its estimated malaria caseload by 56%, from 25.5 million to 11.3 million. Between 2015 and 2017 the total number of cases presumed and confirmed decreased by 25% and reported mortality was more than halved. The Maldives and Sri Lanka remain malaria-free, while seven of the Region’s nine malaria endemic Member States are set to have reduced case incidence by 40% by 2020.
Region-wide, resolve is strong. As reflected in the 2017 Ministerial Declaration on Accelerating and Sustaining Malaria Elimination in the South-East Asia Region, each of the Region’s Member States is committed to fully routing the disease and achieving a malaria-free South-East Asia Region by 2030. Whether high or low burden, making that happen demands each of them strengthen high-impact, country-led and owned approaches, with civil society playing a key role, as per the theme of this year’s World Malaria Day – ‘zero malaria starts with me’.
First, Member States should fully operationalize the 2017 Ministerial Declaration. That means mobilizing adequate and sustained funding for national malaria programmes – including from external partners – and distributing it appropriately and efficiently at every level of implementation. Importantly, among other imperatives, it also means ensuring communities at the grassroots are empowered to act, and have access to long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets, indoor residual spraying, and quality-assured diagnosis and treatment, as per national strategies.
Second, Member States should ensure malaria is a notifiable disease and transform surveillance into a core intervention. To that end, cross-border collaboration is crucial. A cross-border response will allow authorities to respond to outbreaks more efficiently (especially via complementary initiatives) and better protect vulnerable populations in border areas, which are often malaria-prone. It will also enhance country-to-country capacity building, including in research. As part of this, a Region-wide mechanism – with a specific focus on drug- and insecticide-resistance – is needed to integrate malaria surveillance and help achieve these outcomes.
And third, Region-wide advocacy aimed at ensuring malaria remains a core political issue must stay strong. While this is especially important in high and medium burden countries, it is also crucial in countries where subnational elimination is proving troublesome, and where malaria has, like many diseases before it, become a symbol of exclusion, neglect, and marginalization. Wherever and whenever possible, civil society should make its voice as loud as possible and ensure malaria prevention, control and treatment are prioritized and that high-level commitment to eliminating its burden is retained.
WHO is, as always, committed to providing the Member States its full technical and operational support to ensure malaria’s burden is lifted Region-wide. Achieving that outcome is, however, only possible with the full strength, commitment and resolve of the Member States, partners, donors and the public alike. As together we mark World Malaria Day, we must be aware of and embrace our ability to shape history and do so for the better. We must be bold, dare to act, and affirm that achieving ‘zero malaria starts with me’.

https://kathmandutribune.com/improving-sino-nepal-relations-in-21st-century/,"Sino-Nepal relations in the 21st century holds a meaningful relationship in China’s rise to global and regional power. Nepal’s commitment towards China on various issues including Tibet has been applauded by the leaders of both nations.
The Sino-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed on April 28, 1960, is the foundation for the age-long harmonious relationship between China and Nepal. While China is striding forward to claim the global superpower position, Nepal is aiming to replicate the achievement and development garnered by its northern neighbor.
China today is the numero uno FDI contributor to Nepal. After the rise of PM K.P. Oli, China and Nepal’s relations have seen a drastic change for good. Nepal now has a stable government in the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and longs to open more venues and trade points, departing from its southern neighbor India.
India’s role in Nepal cannot be ignored due to the open borders between the two nations. However, the southern neighbor’s erratic and bullying treatment against Nepal has irked a lot of Nepalis. The 1989 and 2015 blockade by India on Nepal reminds most Nepalese and the Nepal government that India cannot be trusted and treated fully. Whereas, China has never interfered in Nepal’s politics but has supported in every way. This must continue but in an engaging manner.
China can no longer afford to remain indifferent and lackluster regarding its ties with Nepal. There’s no doubt that China won’t interfere in Nepal’s politics, but the Chinese government should improve its ties with Nepal’s political parties and ensure that a stable government (now formed) doesn’t collapse within five years. If this happens, external powers like India and the US will make sure to meddle and make sure that China doesn’t make in-roads.
The imperative question here is: how can China and Nepal improve its ties in the 21st century? The world is now a global community, and this too implies in the Sino-Nepal relations. The effort made by the Chinese government towards Nepal is exceptional and outstanding and yet there’s a lot of homework to be done. Can’t Nepal become a key for China to open the gates of South Asia?
Firstly, China and Nepal can improve its relations by opening more trade routes (land and sea) for Nepal. The Belt and Road (BRI) initiative is the epitome for this suggestion. The proposal to bring a train from Lhasa to Kathmandu is laudable and yet most Nepalis fear that Nepal might fall in the debt trap. This misconception should be dissuaded via the Nepal government and Nepali media. The aspiration of Nepalis is to be independent of India and China can help Nepal to achieve this. China can help Nepal from its Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka. For this, Nepal and Sri Lanka should open direct air routes.
Secondly, the flow of people from Nepal to China is negligible. This can be due to the stricter visa process and lack of jobs in China for Nepalis. While a hundred thousand Nepalis live and work in India, it cannot be said the same for China. If China relaxes visa process for Nepali nationals and opens work sector, then the movement of Nepalis toward China will significantly rise. This will eventually help in improving people-to-people ties and event boost Nepal’s economy due to China’s help. Nepali professionals should be allowed to work in mainland China and Hong Kong. Perhaps, China would consider allowing Nepalese to live and work in China for an indefinite time. For this, Nepal’s desire to establish a consulate in Chengdu should be considered by the Chinese government.
Thirdly, Nepal is committed to the one-China policy and it doesn’t allow any anti-China movements. A step further for improving Sino-Nepal relations would be the formation of a ‘Gorkha Regiment’ in the Chinese Army. This will not only improve China and Nepal’s relation but strengthen each other’s army relations. While China can boast of its own Gorkha Regiment, Nepal can be assured that China’s army is always behind it protect its sovereignty.
Fourthly, the entertainment industry often influences people and even improves ties with the other nation. Take Bollywood for example. China too can launch its entertainment services in Nepal: shooting movies in Nepal, holding Chinese Movie festival, and screening of Chinese-language movies (with subtitles) in movie halls of China. Similarly, Nepali movies (with Chinese subtitles) too should be screened in Chinese movie halls and television channels to improve the people-to-people ties.
Fifthly, language is an imperative key to strengthen the ties between China and Nepal. Opening Chinese and Nepali language schools in both nations is already done so the other way would be increasing students’ movement in both nations. China can open its world-class institutions’ branches in Nepal. The other way is to the translation of Nepali and Chinese literary works in both languages. This will greatly help to improve the ties.
Sixthly, China is investing in Nepal on hydropower and other trade sectors. But it should also open Chinese banks, IT companies, service sectors in Nepal to improve the ties. Why can’t Alibaba launch Alipay in Nepal? That would be a gamechanger for both countries. Also, the recent linking of China and Nepal internet is a great achievement. China can greatly benefit from Nepal’s talents while Nepal can achieve rapid economic growth from such investments. Can’t China launch Nepal’s first satellite?
Seventhly, China and Nepal should promote each other in its media such as Xinhua, SCMP, CRI, CCTV+, Sichuan TV & Radio, Nepal Television, and other media houses. It is imperative to continuously emit a positive image of both nations to its citizens. Also, both nations should engage in employing each other’s journalists. Nepali and Chinese journalists will learn closely about China and Nepal if they are employed by Chinese and Nepali media houses in China, Hong Kong, and Nepal. Both countries should set up a proper China and Nepal bureau to improve this relationship.
Lastly, Sports diplomacy is another salient feature to improve the ties of both nations. India recently acquired a Nepali teenager spin bowler (cricketer) and it kind of thawed the soured relationship. China too can include Nepali sports players in its own various big leagues. Also, China can also invest in sports infrastructure in Nepal i.e. cricket and football. Moreover, China and Nepal can improve the ties by conducting a yearly China-Nepal Sports event.
India still holds the top position as a trade partner and China can easily replace them. And it is understandable that China is reluctant about Nepal’s corruption issue. Nepal should address this grave matter and assure China that corruption won’t affect its investment. Whereas, China can teach Nepal on how to curb corruption and effectively finish its developmental projects.
In a nutshell, China and Nepal’s relations in the 21st century is moving forward in a great stride. The above points can be considered by both nations to further strengthen the relationship between the two nations. If the suggestions are implemented, Nepal will be a bridge between China and South Asia. And everyone will benefit from it.

Well, it’s a dream for many but Siddhartha Taneja is fulfilling those.

Siddhartha Taneja is a young 20-year-old Entrepreneur who loves to travel. He is among those who believe in chasing their dreams and making best out of that. We expect a 20-year-old guy to be a college student, right! But Siddhartha sacrificed his college last year just to move toward and achieve all his goals. He started traveling to influence and inspire the youth and conveying a message of loving oneself and the world. He believes that making memories is really important because memories are the only thing which will remain with us for a long time because everything else is temporary in this world.

Siddhartha is an active social media user, having more than 17.1k followers on Instagram,(https://instagram.com/ssidharthh). His recent achievements are something to emphasize on, he has traveled to 7 countries in a span of only one year that on his own earnings. Those countries are Dubai, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Moscow. That sounds phenomenal.

Thus, carrying an influential persona to motivate and encourage others for chasing experiences and making memories, by traveling Siddhartha is becoming an ideal for many.we wish him all the best for his future.

https://kathmandutribune.com/how-to-become-a-travel-blogger-anunay-sood-speaks/,"Everybody has a story behind how they got where they are. Anunay Sood has a particularly strange one.  
Having studied engineering, he struggled to find passion and motive in life, which is when he started traveling.
Every trip he took, every time he discovered how passionate he was about being on his feet, he thought about making his dream a reality (which he knew needed a lot of work).
He started off with taking a job, and traveling when he could on the budget he had. After a few trips, he left the job and started working on more flexible projects.
He then started working with Seclude chain of hotels, in Palampur, where he stayed for 3 months with interns building and creating a fun resort.
After that ended, he tried self-employing himself by photo tours and opening a starter trek organizing community where he took groups of adventure seekers like himself, on popular and otherwise treks.
Here’s where the story gets good.
Months into the practice, feeling confident, social and self-sufficient, he organized a trek to Indrahar Pass in the month of March. Now he realized that at that time of the year, they would need more than just trekking shoes to get everyone to the summit. He arranged ropes, spikes, and everything necessary for this once in a lifetime experience for the people he was taking.
For those of you who are unaware of the trek, it is one of the challenging treks in our country, apart from being high altitude, the month of March meant glaciers and hard ice over the paths they had to cross. Anunay, in the community, played the part of a guide, and a team leader.
Acclimatization, pitching camps on the base camp and training for the ice, all went to plan. They left for the pass early morning, to return safely by afternoon.
While walking up, they reached a point where they had to wear their harnesses and use the ropes they’d practiced on for 2 days prior to d-day, and up they went.
This was Anunay’s fourth time on the route to the pass, with and without snow, so it’s fair to say he knew it like that back of his hand. While climbing up, one of the trekkers, in the middle of the chain of people attached to the same rope, lost her speed due to the altitude and began losing her consciousness.
A small brief about the situation here now: Anunay is at the front of the chain leading, behind the main guide they got along with the group, the trekkers on the trip, and then the helper at the back of the 8 people on the rope. If one person falls, all of them go with her/him.
Back to the situation, she stops, falls dizzy. Anunay, with his ice ax, detaches himself from the rope and goes sliding down to do the same for her, and arrests himself close enough to where she was.

He climbs up to her, while he’s asked everyone to stop and dig their feet strong enough in the snow, removes her carabiner from the rope and rests her on the side so she can fall unconscious safely.
Intense yes? I bet it was a hundred times worse in real life.
He then shouted to the guide in the front to come down and take the rest 7 to the pass, while he rests with her to catch her breath and come to complete consciousness.
That was the last time he took a tour to the mountains, and the first and last time he decided to be a situation where he would have to be willingly responsible for a life.
If it wasn’t for being calm, and alert enough to execute what he did, the story would’ve taken an unwanted turn.
Not all heroes, wear capes; but they do carry a camera bag.

https://kathmandutribune.com/in-nepal-insurance-scam-still-unanswered/,"A multimillion-dollar fraud scam using rescue helicopters teams has been shaking the Nepali tourism business since last year. Even after being revealed by “Travel Assists” and continuously followed by the “Travel Insurance Fraud Journal”, the shady business still thrives on the back of an increasing amount of travelers throughout the Himalayan regions. A worrying fact as the busy trekking season is on its way and around 80% of the Sherpa community depends on this income.
The authorities have confirmed that rescue fraud exists but are watering down its extent that has been traced downed to high profile members of government and industries by International press.
Krishna Prasad Devkota, the Secretary of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, declared that only 186 rescues had taken place in 2018. That is a 88 percent drop compared to the previous year. And is justified by “new government guidelines.” Still, these numbers are far to concur with the 4million $ scam the assurance companies claim they have been victims of.
Credit: Traveller Assist
How does the scam Work?
It’s a nice sunny day, and you have decided to make the most of it. You hire a mountain guide, pack a bag, and decide to climb one of Nepal most impressing mountain tops. It’s maybe your first time in the country, or in the region, so you don’t want to waist a single minute.
The walk up the hill is hard, but you want to catch that sunset before it is too late. Drips of sweat beads on your entire body screaming of pain and tiredness. Your guide seems to be fine. To prove him how tough you are you decided to continue.
Suddenly, you fall on the ground and feel dizzy.
Worried, The Mountain Guide runs towards you and frows on you a diagnostic even faster than a doctor would. “You have mountain sickness”. Or sometimes “you have a fever, a broken ankle…”
Then he will leave you alone. Grab his radio and a few seconds later you hear the sharp whip of a helicopter cutting his way through the wind.
But the real pain comes once you have reached the bottom of the valley and find yourself with a $24,000 dollar tab.
Credit: Nepal Trekking
What Happened?
It is pretty obvious the mountain guide called the helicopter. He will justify it by a generic fact like: he “was worried for your safety” or “it’s dangerous to leave you in the mountains in this condition”, “I had to”.
But what really happens behind the scenes is simply a bribe. Helicopter rescuers company reportedly paid large amounts to guides who would call them for a rescue.
According to the Nepal National Mountain Guide Association, this concerns the unregistered or fake official guides. I was told only 60 can be 100% trusted by the government.
The trick consists in insisting you take an expensive helicopter ride instead of slowly climbing down on your own or resting.
Another twisted trick is making your client sick by poisoning his food with products such as baking soda which can cause vomiting and diarrhea. It frightens the victims into taking the helicopter option without expressing any doubt or concerns.
For the hopefully insured scammed hikers, the money is then drained from their assurance chests. And they are not happy about it. This is why they were the first one to blow the whistle. Using their resources to create an international headline that could no longer be ignored.
Who are responsible? 
Since August 2017, Traveller Assist, an international medical assistance and cost containment company based in Dublin, has been conducting a travel insurance fraud investigation in Nepal. In May 2018, they wrote a letter to the Nepali minister of tourism, pointing fingers to the guilty and indicating the scam has been going on since 2013.
Travel Insurance Fraud Journal: “Logos of 23-brands, under the umbrella of 18-companies, connected by only 10-people who control over 90% of Nepal’s insurance fraud”
We tried to contact the listed companies, few of them answered but denied any responsibility in the matter.
The corruption also thrives inside the government infrastructures. Last month, two official members of the tourism board were arrested and sentenced to jail for their involvement (update 12/04/19: this information needs to be checked).
Recently, the government has been reacting as they are afraid of the long-term impact it will have on tourism, especially with their Visit Nepal 2020 project. But Himalayan Mafia is still standing in the way.
The only advice we can give you: be careful what food is given to you once you are up in the wild and do your research before inquiring a Guide.

https://kathmandutribune.com/shailung-a-beautiful-travel-only-in-nepal/,"The Lost Balcony delivering  on The Himalayas

Shailung is a beautiful remote mountain rural municipality in the Center of Nepal. Hardly ever visited by foreign tourists, and still unknown from most inside travelers. The Valley hides the richest and most colorful cultural aspects Nepal has to offer.
After a day of Jeep, a day of Hicking, and a beautiful sunrise on the Himalayan chain, we were invited in one of its villages as a “Guest of Honour” during their New Years celebration. A magical experience we will forever carry. And a perfect illustration of the human treasures these mountains protect.
In only 48 hours, you as well, you can live inside one of the countries most beautiful paintings!
By reading this article, you will have an overview of the experience that awaits those ready to explore this region… And admire a few pictures brought back only for your eyes.
We hope this will inspire some of our readers to be the next one(s). And help the local heritage to be maintained.


Which way you’ll have to take to live this unique experience?


With exactly 128.67 kilometers square of land, it is easy to get lost in Shailung! But first, you have to arrive there.
Leaving Kathmandu, follow the Aranikho highway towards Dohlaka.
On the way, don’t hesitate to stop in the local villages to drink tasty organic coffee and tea. Especially if you need something to keep you up during the morning drive. As for passengers, don’t miss the opportunity of a car ride through the Bagmati Central Region countryside, where there is always a theatrical scene of Nepal being played.
At 900 meters above the sea level, the lowest Rural municipality you’ll encounter is Chanrnawat Dham. Then, you will have to follow the mountains earth roads in order to appreciate the highest point a view, in Shailung and it’s surroundings.
In Shailung itself, you will easily find Guesthouses where for a reasonable price you will have a nice bed, hot water, and delicious local food such as Dhido. A chance to take rest after this long 5 or 6-hour journey, and be ready for your next day of exploration.
Maybe a drink of Tongba, traditional drink alcoholic beverage of the Lumba culture, will help socialize with the locals before having a good night of sleep.

Sun Rise on the Himalaya, A Glimpse of Paradise.


Wake Up at 5 o’clock a.m, put on some warm clothing, find a local who knows the way, and please go see that amazing morning light the sunrise offers while reaching the mountain tops.
After a bumpy Jeep ride, an hour or two of walking, you will be able to witness the rooftop of our world, as the sun brushes the summits with a dark amber blaze. A unique scenery, not a many can brag to have lived.
Once on top of the mountain, you will be at an altitude of 3145 meters. Above the lowest clouds, floating in a Nepali dream formed by a rich biodiversity, green layouts, and challenging rock paths to follow.

A Sacred Place


Continue your journey towards the highest summit of “the Mountain with a hundred hills”. You will find a view tower and Religious Architecture, hard to miss.
The faithful can pray and meditate while listening to the wind sing its eternal song.
Shailung, is one of the most important religious and historical areas of the Dolakha District. People practice Buddhism, Hindu, and Bon. It is told (but not confirmed) that Buddha Sanghe Mhamorche shared is knowledge in these mountains after meditating in its fresh embrace. Thus, the first name carried by the municipality “Sangelung” Gods whispers.
The adventurous and curious can explore the numerous stone formations hidden between the 100 hills, take pictures facing the great emptiness of the sky, reaching the Himalayan mountain wall, under the multicolored banners. Those who like a bit more action can play in the fresh crispy snow!



Then go visits the cultural magic of Its valleys.


Mountains are not the only thing Shailung municipality has to offer…

We were lucky to be Guests of Honour during the New Years celebration of a small village. Dances were organized, politics talked, food and drinks were served. These people know how to offer hospitality. Their warm welcome is a blessing. Beautiful smiles are shared, while memories are forever saved.

This Year, the village was celebrating the New Year of the Pig. A moment enjoyed by every age group of the valley.

Local Political figures attended the ceremony, in order to share their visions and ideas regarding the future of the district. Tourism playing a great part in it.

Traditional music was played, followed by the villager’s voices and cheers! This man is playing local melodies with his Damphu Drum.

They are 10 thousand women in the rural municipality (more than 50% of the population). They make the most of the occasion by putting out their most beautiful flashy floral dresses, and shiny jewelry.

A Growing Region

In Shailung, around 90% of the families depend on agricultural activities. The breed of Yaks and sheep are the most popular on hillsides. Consequently, selling dairy products is the first source of income in this area.
The Government recently announced that main roads joining the important villages are soon to be black-topped, even if no official date has been released for the project. This will make connections and visit easier in the future.
As for education, the rural district can count 39 schools, but only one High School.
Also, it is important to note there are 6 health points and one police station. Safety and security are assured on a small scale.
Politicians are very positive regarding their future development projects, but proofs of advancement are still needed to be shown. Tourism is an economical key that can profit to everyone and would push forward the progress.

https://kathmandutribune.com/top-10-foreigners-visiting-nepal/,"Tourism is a vital part of the Nepali economy. Representing more than 10% of the national income, the country largely depends on its foreign visitors. Rather it is for vacations, trekking, or visiting parents and siblings, people all around the world gather in planes and buses sending them straight to the Roof of the World. But where do they come from? Who are these foreign faces you may cross at a corner street?
Using the Ministry of Culture, Tourism & Civil Aviation reports, this article will hopefully give you enlightenment on the origins of the top 10 foreigners you are more likely to meet in Nepal.
And don’t forget to book your transportation here.
1) INDIA (17%)

It is without any surprise, Indians arrive at the first place of this billboard!
Obviously, one of the main reasons being the proximity factor. Nepal and India share 1,758 kilometers of land border and 7 entry points which are very easy to cross.
A cheap and short journey but also, an easy one. Thanks to the governmental administration which makes sure that Indians do not need to apply for a Visa before entering Nepal. Therefore facilitating traffic and exchanges at the border.
Finally, visiting relatives is another logical explanation for this high rate of immigration. There are approximately 6 million Nepalies currently living in on their neighbor’s soil, which is the equivalent of 20% of the Nepalis population. On the other side, 4 million Indians have decided to build a life in Nepal. It is known by all, the concept of the family is very important, if not everything, for these cultures, so naturally, visits are regularly organized.
2) CHINA (11%)

Chinese tourism has just been a constant expanding boom around the world since the government authorized it in 1991.
In 2017 more than 130 million of them took a holiday trip abroad. A 7% rise compared to 2016, and these numbers keep growing. Countries across the world have started calling it a “wave”, a tsunami expected with open arms for the profits it brings to the tourism industry.
As for Nepal, in 2017 more than 104 000 inhabitants of China dropped their bags and took out their cameras around the country (4 times more than in 2007). Once more, the proximity and the no visa policy for a one-month stay helps.
Recently, prime minister Khadga Prasad Oli visited China. After a political meeting with the Ministry of Tourism, a year-long project called Visit Nepal year 2020 was introduced in a statement and strongly supported by the Chinese government. The objective being, increasing the tourist exchange between the two countries, as much as Nepal wishes to do so with the rest of the World.
3) USA (8%)

We enter a new category of visitors, those from overseas. Occidental usually come in Nepal for the mesmerizing wild landscapes it offers and makes the most of the trekking trails. Americans send each year a lot of its bravest amateur or professional athletes seeking for adventure tourism.
You just have to take a look at the Mount Everest records, you will see a lot of Stars and Stripes flags floating in between the Nepalis prowesses. Dave Hahn accented 15 times the Everest with no sherpa, Melissa Annot 6 times. You also have more surprising profiles such as Jordan Romero who is the youngest climber to ever make it on top of the world, arriving at the peak of the highest mountain earth has to offer only aged 13.
The United States of America is one of the biggest tourist industry in the world. More than 30 million Americans travel the globe each year but still, prefer Europe capitals or sandy tropical beaches to mountains.
Holiday and pleasure are the purposes of 70% of visits to Nepal in 2015, trekking only adds up to 8%.
4) THE UNITED KINGDOM (6%)

Her Majesty the queen’s subjects also seem to have put Nepal on top of their bucket lists!
This time Nepal doesn’t share a border with this country but a History, 200 years of it to be exact. This goes back to when Nepal was apart of the Empire where the Sun never set.
Since it’s independence in 1923, the two nations have kept close contact despite the colonization past. English occupation has had a grand influence on the modern-day culture of Nepal, especially in its language. British folks will be happy to discover a few common words such as “coffee”, “Computer”, “Bye Bye”… It’s not much but it is a good start for the 51 000 annual visitors.
5) SRI LANKA (4,8%)

“The Land of Glitter”
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: “Nepal and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka established diplomatic relations on 1 July 1957. Relations between the two countries are marked by goodwill, mutual understanding, and cooperation.” a formal description sure, but this can only be good for tourism.
The two countries share a profound belief in Buddhism. They have found a common path to peace and exchange through pilgrimages. The most sacred destination chose by Sri Lanka’s spiritual travelers is the birthplace of Boudha in the Lumbini temple.
In order to increase the number of visitors, the two countries have signed an Air Service Agreement in 2009, leading to an effective air service connection. Noticeably, it worked, because since then the number of visitors has increased by 25%.
6) THAILAND (4%)

“The smiling country” or “The country of Free Men”
Any of these two joyful sentences is a well-given name for its inhabitants. The 40 000 Thai people who have made the most of their liberty to visit Nepal these last years have always brought the happiness marked on their faces, and no doubt it returned even brighter.
The two countries have bounded around their close cultures and shared spiritual and ethical values. Like Sri Lanka, a lot of visitors come to recollect, pray and meditate in the many old temples Nepal has to offer, and especially to visit the birthplace of Buddha.
Yet the number of arrivals significantly decreased from 2014 to 2016. This was maybe due to the 2015 earthquake mixed with the Thai political crisis that occurred around the same time. Nevermind, today these numbers have caught up was where there were left 4 years ago.

7) MYANMAR (3,5%)

We have reached the last close neighbor of this top 10.
And once more, Buddhism is the common factor as 88% of the Myanmar population practices it. No stats are available before 2016 regarding immigration. But in only one year, the number of its visitors has increased by 25%, reaching nearly 31 000.
Economical discussions have been complicated between the two countries these past years, but in November 2018 they have finally reached an agreement, a positive outcome announcing future exchanges and more proximity.
Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar illustrate why pilgrimage is the purpose for 15% of visits in Nepal, which is more than trekking (8%).
8) AUSTRALIA (3,4%)

Kangourou Land is full of adventuress souls always ready to jump on the first plane towards the unknown. 
9) SOUTH KOREA (3,4%)
Busan, South Korea
“The calm morning country” what a poetic word for this small Asian republic situated the other side of China.
10) GERMANY (3,2%)

Germany is the second biggest country launching tourists around the world, approximately 70 million travelers for 80 million foreign travels. And they do not spare on expenses: 130 billion dollars spent throughout the continents. If you go out of Nepal, there are the faces you are more likely to see in your hotel, alongside the Chinese, Americans, and French.
30 000 of them visited Nepal in 2017.

https://kathmandutribune.com/international-news-update-5th-december/,"France and the USA disagree on the future of OTAN and Syria; Venice is slowly swallowed by the tides, Matteo Salvini rejected by humble Italian sardines, this is what the world has been talking about these last days. Stay updated on international news by reading the following feedback suggested by Kathmandu Tribune editorial team. Witness the world-changing and keep track of its highlights for a better understanding of the present.

NATO: Macron and Trump disagree, again
It’s like being sent back to high school years. Since the G7, renamed G2 by the foreign press, the two cool kids in the international political playground seemed to be Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron. With their not so secret breakfast meetings and the publicly exposed new friendship, the world believed that peace had overcome the weird handshakes and tap on the shoulders exchanged during their first encounter. But back home, in their respective political neighborhood, the backstabbing speech contest started. Between the French president’s new GAFA Tax on global technological groups imports and Trump’s answer on a 100% tax for French wine, bags, and cosmetics, let’s just say the honeymoon was over. In London, the romance seemed broken during the OTAN 70-year birthday ceremony. The subject of tension this time was Syria. Trump, angry with Macron for calling his expensive NATO “brain-dead” even after himself calling it “obsolete”, didn’t keep his tong in his pocket, once more. Viral videos highlighted two specific comments were the President of the United States called out his peer for “one of the greatest non-answer he ever heard”  on the question about the repatriation of foreign prisoners and even offered to the French president if he would like “some nice ISIS fighters”. “Let’s be serious,” said Macron when reminding his colleague that most of the prisoners are not European but originate from the conflicted region.
Trump officially announced last year his wish to send American troops back home has he considers that the enemy has been defeated. A scenario feared by the French government who wish to maintain an occidental presence on the ground.

ITALY: A Fish Farming revolution against Salvini.
The aquatic wordplay is relevant. On the 1st of December a human wave with no less than 25 000 people stranded on la Piazza del Duomo in Milan. To add a bit of poetic drama, yes it was a cold and rainy day, but that didn’t stop the people protesting the rise of the far-right party.
It all starts with the small activist work of 4 merchants spreading a message meant to be more than the joke through which it was shared: “No flag, no party, no insult. Create your own sardine and participate in the first fish revolution in history.” Their plan was to organize more than a flash mob, a “fish mob”, where everybody will be “as tight as sardines in a box”. The purpose was to stop the rise of Salvini, getting closer to the power each day, especially with the upcoming regional elections. And after the event became viral on social media, thousands of people joined the peaceful, insult free and civilized demonstration.

Will Venice disappear under the water?
Venice is flooded! It’s the same story every year during autumn, the return of what locals call the “Aqua Alta”. But every year the problem gets worst. From once every 3 years, to 20 times a year. It has reached the point where scientists have predicted a future Atlantis, the antic city beneath the sea level. In 2050, it is possible that nobody will be able to visit or live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Whose fault is it?
The southern wind of sirocco aggravates the rising of the tie in the Adriatic Sea lagoon on which the city was built more than a millennium ago.  The atmospheric depression of the seasonal bad weather is also an important factor, as it allows the sea to stretch. And as if it wasn’t enough, Venice naturally sinks into the ground because of its position on tectonic plates. But enough with the natural causes, because humans have a lot to do with the “Aqua Alta” as well.
The excessive groundwater extraction done in the sixties in order to obtain gas weakened the ground. More recently it’s the industrial activities that dried out the land and stopped water from naturally spreading throughout the land. Finally, we have the most popular cause: Global Warming, melting the ice continents and dangerously rising the sea level.
A six-billion-euro dam project was launched but was never completed because of enormous corruption and fraud scandals surrounding it. Biologists are the only ones happy by this, as they stated this solution would have destroyed the local ecosystem. Today, people of Venice are saying greedy industries and politicians have condemned their homes, and they are maybe right.

https://kathmandutribune.com/international-news-update-12-november-2019/,"A Bolivian president on the run, fires in Australia, escalating protests in Hong Kong, this is what the world has been talking about these last days. Stay updated on international news by reading the following feedback suggested by Kathmandu Tribune editorial team. Witness the world-changing and keep track of its highlights for a better understanding of the present.

Bolivian president steps down and takes off
On Sunday the 10th of November, Evo Morales stepped down on his presidential position after weeks of violent riots contesting shady elections and 14 years of disappointing leadership.
https://twitter.com/m_ebrard
While leaving the country for Mexico after being accorded political asylum by its foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard, he tweeted his disappointment to his people and vowed to come back: “I’ll return soon with more strength and energy”
A picture of him holding a Mexican flag in a jet on his way to Mexico was shared and social media. The socialist government supports Morales’s political legitimacy but after losing his political allies and the support of his army the Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador thanked him for stepping down rather than let the violence escalate and put more Bolivian lives at risk.

Australia harassed by bush fires
An uncontrollable series of furies are consuming the Australian bush in the State of New South Wales. Among the 85 registered, only half can presently be controlled. 1 million hectares of land and 150 houses have already been damaged, and 100 people are being treated for injuries. Several Emergency warnings are in place as inhabitants live under the threat of urgent danger.

The bush fire is the consequence of a 3 years drought, making the job even harder for firefighters.

Honk Kong stuck in growing violence
The fight between Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters and riot police is still ongoing and is taking a violent turn. On Monday, one of the protesters was shot by a policeman (he is now in critical condition) and a person was set on fire.
The fight is now taking place in the central district, home to several international companies and in universities. A symbolic call for help or attention to the western world against China’s desire to control the region.
Since its independence from Great Britain in 1997, Hong Kong is a land of freedom with a radical system opposition with its Chinese neighbor, trying to regain political and economic control of the city. Until this day, no compromise has been found for a return to relative calm.

https://kathmandutribune.com/in-france-women-walk-against-femicides/,"“Solidarity and Sisterhood for all women of the world” This sentence could be heard in many French city streets yesterday, as more than 50 000 women and men gathered to march against the alarming rising number of femicides.  The inspiring event tainted in pale purple was organized by the collective #noustoutes (#usall) to remind us of the difficulties faced by numerous innocents around the globe and call out the government to act.

In 48 hours, another woman will be killed
As many speakers reminded the participants of the march in Toulouse, where the pictures were taken, 137 women were killed by their domestic partner or by the result of pure criminal hatred since the beginning of the year 2019 in France (roughly one every two days).
“They call it passionate crimes, but it isn’t, it’s murder, end of story” declares one of the participants. “And they must not be one more”.

But to find an answer, one must first identify the problem. The French legal system still hasn’t inscribed the term “femicide” in the penal code. A flaw pointed out by ONU Women France in a shocking campaign last week, asking France to remedy as soon as possible. This illustrates a lack of clear designation. After every femicide, when the sad question “how can this still happen” comes up on the table, the political debate stutters.
The morning before the protest, media actors started to turn towards the doctors, and their legal boundaries to keep a professional secret when faced with domestic injuries. A doctor answered, “They are not looking at the right place. We, doctors, know what to do, the problem in France is the juridical protection, justice not being served, complaints not being taken seriously, this is what has to change.”

As a reminder, in France, according to the national statistics institution numbers, 219 000 women a year have been victims of physical and/or sexual violence by the spouse. During their lives, 14,5 percent of women have been concerned about violence linked to their gender.
Between joy and sadness
This walk could have been silent, but it wasn’t. The matter is sad, it even calls for mourning, as we remember those who have fallen under the violence used by men from their now past lives. However, even under the November rain, a beautiful display of colors (the symbolic color chosen was pale purple) showed women that they are not alone in this fight.

Smiles were more present than rage. It was a peaceful march where ideas could be exchanged and a surprisingly popular one too. Observers from the human rights league noticed that even the police force display showed authorities were expecting fewer people.
Feminism takes the form of many various movements around the globe, and France is not an exemption. Everybody has its own solution and means to pursue it.
If more than 50 percent of French women consider themselves feminists, they don’t all agree on what it means. “No mix !” was sometimes shouted in the procession by groups of demonstrators. A recent study made by miXitY TEDx ChampsÉlyséesWomen puts forward that more than a quarter of the population surveyed thinks that men can’t consider themselves as feminists. But student associations from local universities argue the contrary. Among these different groups and visions advocating for equal rights. There are also more famously radical forms of feminism that repeatedly create debates, like the Femen. A Ukrainian and now a global group of female activists well-known for their topless protests and strong messages targeting violence from the hands of men and the patriarchal cultures.

During the walk against women violence in the southern city Toulouse, three women got a lot of attention by covering their naked bodies with red paint and accusing the pornographic industry. Some other participants who strongly disagreed on their number one suspect asked them to stop putting themselves forward and even took away a few of their handmade signs.
Also in the spirit of plurality, Latino feminist associations were invited to take a stand and share their collective experiences in their respective countries that suffered an alarming total of 2 321 femicides last year.
An inspirational afternoon for some, a reminder that the fight has just begun for others.

https://kathmandutribune.com/scholarship-programs-bring-nepali-student-from-ut-tyler-to-uk/,"LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY, UNITED STATES — The University of Kentucky has offered a full-ride scholarship to Nepali student Ojaswi Piya, one of the 61 talented students from Nepal whose scholarships at the University of Texas at Tyler were recently canceled.
“This full-ride made my dreams and educational goals and aspirations seem possible again,” Piya said. “I was beyond happy — words can’t convey how grateful I am to have this amazing opportunity come to me.”
Piya, from Kathmandu, Nepal, has accepted the offer and will join the Wildcat family this fall. She plans to major in biology but is also interested in other areas such as sustainability, the environment, and waste management.
When searching for universities, Piya wanted to see which institutions had her programs of interest, as well as undergraduate research opportunities. That was one of the reasons she had originally applied to UT Tyler.
For the first time, the university was offering a presidential scholarship that covered everything — tuition, room, and board. International students would be well-represented in the awards. Piya was among the selected candidates. It wasn’t until after the offer letters went out that officials realized they had extended the scholarships to more students than they could afford.
“I was completely baffled,” Piya said. “I stared at my screen for several minutes. I pinched myself to see if it was a dream or if it was really happening.”
At that moment, Piya thought she wouldn’t be able to study in the U.S. anymore and that her efforts had gone to waste. “Then I went crazy searching universities but did not have much luck that day,” she added. “And even if they did take the application, their funding had been depleted.”
Piya, along with other affected students, quickly came together to devise a plan on how to find placements. She met with several advisers, including Selena Malla, who told her not to give up hope.
“Initially, I thought there wouldn’t be sympathy,” Piya said. “We’re from a small country, miles away from the U.S. I didn’t think it would lead somewhere but with the news spreading around, people taking measures in higher education to ensure we had options, a miracle started happening. People started stepping forward, universities started to step forward. And there came the University of Kentucky.”
Malla was one of the main contacts for the UK, as Audra Cryder, director of international enrollment at the UK International Center, reached out to the Education USA Nepal team via Facebook to offer help.
Cryder messaged Malla and offered a partial scholarship to one of the affected students but she learned those funds weren’t enough to support one’s full tuition and living expenses. Cryder came back to the drawing board and with the help of the enrollment management, as well as Asia Payne and Sandy Copher in the Student Financial Aid and Scholarships office, the team was able to pull the resources to assist and help fund one full-ride scholarship.
Piya was one of the students Cryder selected as a potential candidate based on a set of criteria; including being academically admissible, programmatic fit, leadership and engagement experience, and whether the location was a significant factor in making a decision on the university. Malla then reviewed the list and recommended Piya for UK.
“Once we knew that she was interested, we pretty much admitted her within the same working day,” Cryder said. Piya received her acceptance packet in only 10 days. “Everyone worked very quickly and very efficiently,” Cryder added. “It helped that Selena (with Education USA) provided all the documents immediately. Anything we needed was right there.”
Three scholarship programs and offices across campus came together to make this possible — the UK International Center, UK Enrollment Management, and UK Student Financial Aid and Scholarships offices.
Piya didn’t know the UK in-depth but after researching, she said she knew that the UK would be the perfect place for her to explore her research interest in the sciences and the environment, and potentially find solutions to what she sees are pressing and shared issues found in both Kentucky and Nepal.
“UK really came as a knight in shining armor for me,” Piya said. “I’m really grateful to the University of Kentucky and I will try my best to not let anyone down and make you proud of taking me in. I’ll do that by giving back to the university by sharing my culture and being successful in whichever career path I decide to pursue in the end.”
So far, 26 out of 61 students have been placed in a university.
Even though things have fallen into place for Piya, she said it is not over because she hasn’t been able to find homes for everyone yet. “I’d like to help them and continue on this mission to finding homes to all of the affected students,” she said.
For more information on the Nepali students who still seek replacement scholarship, or on ways to help, please go online or directly contact Selena Malla, with Education USA Nepal, or Joan Liu and Jamie Kanki.

Seeking hosts to house temporarily displaced residents and disaster relief workers; letting displaced residents and relief workers know about the Open Homes program
Airbnb has activated its Open Homes Program to help displaced residents and relief workers deployed to the regions impacted by flooding in Nepal.
The Open Homes Program recruits hosts who are willing and able to provide free housing to displaced residents and disaster relief workers in the activation area.
Airbnb Hosts within the affected areas have the ability to opt into listing their homes offering accommodation free of charge to those in need by visiting www.airbnb.com/nepalfloods19.

“Airbnb’s Open Homes Program connects those people in need or relief workers deployed to the region with temporary accommodation offered by local hosts who are opening their homes free of charge. We encourage hosts in the region who are able to consider opening their homes to those in need of temporary accommodation,” Mr. Thomas said.
The Open Homes Program is currently available to 4 August 2019. As a public service, Airbnb asks that media outlets consider sharing the following link: www.airbnb.com/nepalfloods19.
