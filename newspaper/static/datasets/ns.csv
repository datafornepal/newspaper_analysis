However, some financial experts claimed that the relief measures are not adequate to address the banking and financial tribulations incited by the coronavirus ‘pandemic’.
“This is an extraordinary situation which requires unconventional measures. However, the rate cuts announced by the NRB are not enough to address the current problem,” exclaimed Nara Bahadur Thapa, former Executive Director of the NRB.

What is ‘Coronavirus’?
Coronavirus are a broad range of viruses that can cause infections ranging from mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses like common cold to much more serious diseases like SARS. The virus can spread from human to human and from animals to humans.

As of now, there is no sustained human-to-human transmission, however, the WHO has warned the countries to prepare for the possibility that there could be a wider outbreak.

Anyone suffering from fever, difficulty in breathing and respiratory illnesses should be quarantined to decrease the risk of contracting and spreading the disease, said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/government/stranded-in-nepal-message-for-tourists-stuck-in-nepal/,"Find below information from Nepal Tourism Board who are stranded in Nepal.
1) If you want help, YOUR GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO KNOW WHO AND WHERE YOU ARE. The most important thing right now is to register your desire to leave with your respective Embassy or Consulate. You can do this electronically and you can find information on their website.
Remember that if your country does not have an embassy here, you should register with your responsible embassy abroad (likely in New Delhi). Be sure you provide a reliable way to contact you (email preferably). Get a SIM card if you don’t already have one.
2) If you have shelter and food, do not move until instructed to do so by your embassy. You must respect the lockdown and social distancing first and foremost.
3) You are not alone! There are currently between 1000 and 2000 foreigners in your situation. The embassies are coordinating with the authorities to establish an evacuation plan.
The airlines have stopped being effective or reliable, so there is no point in trying to book or rebook yourself until the airport reopens and regular airline services resume. The embassies are looking for a solution on behalf of the group.
4) Remember that it takes a lot of effort to gather 2000 people near the airport from all corners of the country while respecting social distancing. Then you must have enough planes to get them out (approx. 230 pax/flight). And most will have to connect to another flight to get home.
So, the logistics are complex and cannot be worked out on a case by case basis.
The embassies are working on:

Authorized transportation to Kathmandu
Designated hotels and restaurants to gather the group safely near the airport while respecting lockdown and social distancing
Special transportation to the airport and check-in
Special charter flights out of Nepal

5) You will be expected to pay for the hotel/food/flight. Some embassies might help you financially based a promissory note, but that is not offered by all countries.
The end horizon for this crisis is in mid-April at best. But it might take longer until some freedoms are recovered.
The best option if you can, is to stay put and respect the lockdown/restrictions until it is over. Conditions are most likely not going to be better in your country and the trip back is going to be long and dangerous.
Don’t worry about your Visa, Nepal has granted amnesty on foreign visas and it will be sorted out later.
BUT WHATEVER YOU DECIDE, PLEASE LET YOUR EMBASSY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE.

Where to Stay & Eat
We shall try to maintain an updated list of accommodations, restaurants and eateries still serving, but cannot promise the validity of this data. It changes on a regular basis.

The National Security Advisor and Commander of the Royal Guard Sheikh Nasser Bin Hamad Al Khalifa has already selected a team for the upcoming expedition.
But before climbing the Mt Everest the team has planned to climb Mt Lobuche East and Mt Manaslu to gain the required climbing skills and training to reach the world’s highest peak.

Earlier, the Nepali Government has suspended the 2020 Mt Everest Expedition in view of growing coronavirus threat.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/special-stories/lockdown-in-nepal-a-glance-at-stress-factor-among-working-population/,"The world is engaged in the most serious “civil health war” due to the novel coronavirus in nearly 20-21 years and Nepal is also not left untouched with this global health crisis.
The situation is incomparable yet reminds us of the SARS epidemic that happened approximately 17 years back.
There is a race against the time in campaigning and preparing for the battle, such as:

Battlefields of science and technology
Research on the fastest detection
Development of vaccines
Research on new antivirus drugs to inhibit viruses
Rediscovery of some “old drugs”

Ways to formulate and implement the most effective public and clinical treatment and logistics support measures… and more
There is no doubt that the world will win the battle of this pandemic, and the victory is just around the corner in the next few weeks, even though we are being optimistic.

Science and technology war can be won or lost which will be witnessed in the coming time. The earliest epidemic prevention and control on “human to human” transmission of the disease has led to the closure of many cities in many countries around the globe.
This worldwide blockage has resulted in a heavy loss in the financial sector as well as other resources.
Ongoing Psychological Stress due to Lockdown
Many posted on social media that the people were tired earlier than usual.
During their working days, they usually stayed up late for a short time. But now during this lockdown, they started sleeping at 10 o’clock.
A lot of people are thinking, when we are doing less work but still getting tired, how can this be possible?
The fatigue/restlessness we experience is more likely to be related to the mental load associated with COVID-19 than the physical load we usually bear.
Fatigue has both physiological and non-physiological reasons. The physiological reason for fatigue is we rest after hardcore work or when we get sick.
But studies have also shown that fatigue can be caused by some physical as well as psychological conditions, such as stress and anxiety.
This pandemic made people confused and fearful. All these feelings lead to poor sleep quality, which in turn makes people more tired and anxious.
To break the cycle, exercise is a useful tool. Walking or taking an online exercise class can make you feel tired. But in the long run, it will reduce your fatigue as your sleep quality improves.

Planning and setting goals is now both possible and necessary. Set a future date for unblocking and be prepared to reset it if necessary. Being optimistic about the future and looking forward to it will also help reduce anxiety and fatigue.
I feel that people can think about adaptation and transition during the current LOCKDOWN situation.
It will take time but in stages!
The first week of adaptation involves breaking away from previous ways of life and work and building new interactions like getting close to your families which we didn’t do while we were busy with our job or work.

These are usually achieved on the fourth or fifth day when your mind starts getting habituated for staying at home talking to family members unlike office talks, after which life begins to become more stable and predictable.
During the first few weeks of homestay, extrovert people may feel depressed and may cry but the opposite goes for introvert people who feel like the golden opportunity of staying away from people. This is a normal adaptation phase.
Method of Adaptation
We shouldn’t worry too much, but rest assured that this will pass for most people and you will feel better next week.
The shift to a new environment can be helped by writing a reflective diary. It helps to write down your thoughts and feelings. Then you can review your progress and see how you adjust.
Full adaptation to the new lifestyle will take place in the next several months.
However, there is a time to realize that this can happen approximately three weeks after the start of homestay, when one may survive depression and low morale.
In this context, the fear is that the blockade/lockdown situation is now permanent but once that this stage is never going to over, the frustration might return.
The next lesson on how to maintain energy comes from observing people in a state of existence.
To avoid a state of apathy, depression, and lack of motivation, it is important to build a clear structure for your day. The plan gives us some control in life.
It helps prevent the accumulation of ‘leisure time’, which can make you very aware of realization and lead to a growing sense of drift.
This can make people feel isolated and indifferent, have a sound sleep, and do not neglect personal hygiene.

An extreme case of the living world shows that when we suddenly face this kind of epidemic situation, the survival instinct emerges.
And I appreciate the support that Nepalese people have shown for the lockdown.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/world/4532-foreigners-airlifted-from-nepal/,"Even though Nepal has suspended all international flights, various foreign countries have managed to conduct international chartered flights to rescue their nationals stranded in Nepal.
According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), a total of 4, 532 foreigners have been airlifted from Nepal through 34 international chartered flights from March 24 to April 23.
Even the Nepalis with the green card have left for Australia and the US during the period.

Nine airlines companies have conducted flights to Nepal. They include including Nepal Airlines, Titan Airways, Malindo Air, Shree Airlines, Sudan Airways, Buddha Air, Druk Air, and Himalayan Airlines.
Nepal Airlines has conducted five flights while Qatar Airways conducted nine flights.

The party has launched a website www.Work4Nepal.com to provide information and required assistance to the helpless Nepalis willing to return to Nepal.
The portal aims at connecting returning migrant workers with the employers in Nepal.

The party is set to help the migrant workers to gain employment opportunities in government and non-government organizations as per their skill set and expertise.
Meanwhile, the party representatives have already held discussions with the Nepali ambassadors in countries including Qatar, Oman, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and Egypt to understand the condition of Nepalis.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/coronavirus/investing-in-wash-to-prevent-covid-19/,"More Nepalis abroad than in Nepal have contracted and died from the coronavirus. At least 33 Nepalis in the UK, 15 in the United States, two in the United Arab Emirates, and one in Ireland have died from COVID-19.
Many hundreds more have fallen ill in 21 other countries, including Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Malaysia.
This highlights the fact that Nepal sends more labor migrants abroad, per capita, than any other country in South Asia. The virus’s impact on Nepalis outside the country could portend significant long-term difficulty for the Nepali economy.
At least for now, however, the coronavirus direct effects have been much milder in Nepal than in many other countries. As of April 29, there were only 57 cases, of whom 16 have recovered and no confirmed deaths reported.
This can be at least partly attributed to significant advances in Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH).

Nepal was declared free of open defecation on September 30, 2019. The Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) data shows that in 2018, 97% of the population had access to basic sanitation facilities. This is a huge leap from 1990 when only 6% of households had toilets.
Today, almost all citizens living in hill and mountain belts have some kind of access to toilets.
As important, 87% of people have access to basic water supplies. This is critical to the handwashing that helps prevent coronavirus and other illnesses.
But for all the gains made over the past two decades, more needs to be done.
While the overwhelming majority of people have access to water, 13% still lack it. And while most Nepalis have access to toilets, many of them are shared by multiple households.  While this is certainly preferable to open defecation, it is not sufficient to fully minimize risk.
As important, many of these water and toilet facilities need maintenance and repair. The 2015 earthquake damaged many WASH facilities, especially in rural areas. While people technically have access to them, in reality, many are difficult to use.
Further, there exists a continued need for education about how to properly use the sanitation and water facilities that are in good working order.

Many toilets in rural areas go unused or have even been turned into animal sheds.  While people have access to water, it is often in limited quantities, so people understandably prioritize drinking over handwashing.  Or people wash their hands, but without soap and proper drying.
All this can and is being addressed. For example, our organization works with community groups in five districts covering 49 rural communities to implement holistic development programs. Central to all these programs is WASH components tailored to the needs of each community.
Community members are regularly given educational classes on:

Treating water through filtration or boiling for drinking
Proper handwashing with soap
Menstrual health management
Waste management at the household and community level
Regular maintenance of toilets
Regular maintenance of public water taps

Also, we work with local partners to install handwashing stations with soap and proper drying facilities.  We have also introduced households to drying racks for dishes and utensils to eliminate placing these items on the ground to dry.
These are simple and inexpensive innovations with large results:

Reduction in water-borne diseases, especially diarrhea in children under five
Significant improvements among women in reproductive health issues
New and well-maintained toilets
Virtually no open defecation, even among children
Drinking water filtered or boiled and covered while storing
Community pathways clear of animal and other waste

The abrupt nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020, made it impossible for our organization and others to visit communities to conduct refresher classes on hand washing and related preventive measures. The good news is these communities were already prepared, so phone call reminders were sufficient.
People in the communities in which we work are doing what they should in terms of hygiene and sanitation to protect themselves and their neighbors from the coronavirus.

The major challenge in these rural communities is ‘social distancing‘.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 21.6% of those infected with the coronavirus in Wuhan, China were farmers and laborers.  Although the villages with which we work are scattered in terms of distance from one house to another, rural communities usually have public water taps. In toilets can be shared by four to five households.
Further, farmers must go to the field to work, tend to their livestock, and travel to local markets to sell their produce. This is all difficult to do in ways that maintain social distance.  Addressing this will likely require more significant government actions.

Before the coronavirus crisis, advances in water, sanitation, and hygiene have played a significant role in preventing life-threatening diseases and improving lives.  The pandemic has reinforced the need for better and sustainable community-managed WASH facilities.

While private organizations like ours have a role to play, governments need to continue to invest in these basic human needs essential to sustained economic and social development.  Nepal has made so much progress in this area.
The coronavirus should be an impetus to do even more to improve health and living standards.

Lately, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has directed the banks and financial institutions in the country to provide a 2% discount on the interest rate to the COVID-19 affected entrepreneurs and individuals.
With this, the banks issuing loans from now on should reduce the interest by 2% and count the interest amount of the fourth trimester of the FY 2019/20.

The NRB has also ordered the banks to extend the payment due date of the monthly/trimester installments for months of Baisakh and Jeth and till the end of Ashadh.
According to the NRB instructions, no additional charges or fines can be levied in case of such installments.
Moreover, the BFIs should extend the payment of the principal and interest of all recurrent capital-type short-term loans to be paid during the lockdown period by 60 days.
However, the aforementioned provisions do not apply to:

Food processing, sale, and distribution
LPG bottling, sale, and distribution
Internet service providers
Telecom service providers
Television service providers
Tobacco and alcohol-based industries
Hydropower projects in operation

So far, Nepal has reported only 57 coronavirus infection cases. However, the coronavirus pandemic has halted all businesses, tourism activities, Everest Expedition, and international travel, among others.
As of now, the global coronavirus infection cases have raised over 3.22 million and death cases reached 228,270.
