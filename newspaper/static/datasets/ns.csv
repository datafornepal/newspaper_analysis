However, some financial experts claimed that the relief measures are not adequate to address the banking and financial tribulations incited by the coronavirus ‘pandemic’.
“This is an extraordinary situation which requires unconventional measures. However, the rate cuts announced by the NRB are not enough to address the current problem,” exclaimed Nara Bahadur Thapa, former Executive Director of the NRB.

What is ‘Coronavirus’?
Coronavirus are a broad range of viruses that can cause infections ranging from mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses like common cold to much more serious diseases like SARS. The virus can spread from human to human and from animals to humans.

As of now, there is no sustained human-to-human transmission, however, the WHO has warned the countries to prepare for the possibility that there could be a wider outbreak.

Anyone suffering from fever, difficulty in breathing and respiratory illnesses should be quarantined to decrease the risk of contracting and spreading the disease, said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/government/stranded-in-nepal-message-for-tourists-stuck-in-nepal/,"Find below information from Nepal Tourism Board who are stranded in Nepal.
1) If you want help, YOUR GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO KNOW WHO AND WHERE YOU ARE. The most important thing right now is to register your desire to leave with your respective Embassy or Consulate. You can do this electronically and you can find information on their website.
Remember that if your country does not have an embassy here, you should register with your responsible embassy abroad (likely in New Delhi). Be sure you provide a reliable way to contact you (email preferably). Get a SIM card if you don’t already have one.
2) If you have shelter and food, do not move until instructed to do so by your embassy. You must respect the lockdown and social distancing first and foremost.
3) You are not alone! There are currently between 1000 and 2000 foreigners in your situation. The embassies are coordinating with the authorities to establish an evacuation plan.
The airlines have stopped being effective or reliable, so there is no point in trying to book or rebook yourself until the airport reopens and regular airline services resume. The embassies are looking for a solution on behalf of the group.
4) Remember that it takes a lot of effort to gather 2000 people near the airport from all corners of the country while respecting social distancing. Then you must have enough planes to get them out (approx. 230 pax/flight). And most will have to connect to another flight to get home.
So, the logistics are complex and cannot be worked out on a case by case basis.
The embassies are working on:

Authorized transportation to Kathmandu
Designated hotels and restaurants to gather the group safely near the airport while respecting lockdown and social distancing
Special transportation to the airport and check-in
Special charter flights out of Nepal

5) You will be expected to pay for the hotel/food/flight. Some embassies might help you financially based a promissory note, but that is not offered by all countries.
The end horizon for this crisis is in mid-April at best. But it might take longer until some freedoms are recovered.
The best option if you can, is to stay put and respect the lockdown/restrictions until it is over. Conditions are most likely not going to be better in your country and the trip back is going to be long and dangerous.
Don’t worry about your Visa, Nepal has granted amnesty on foreign visas and it will be sorted out later.
BUT WHATEVER YOU DECIDE, PLEASE LET YOUR EMBASSY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE.

Where to Stay & Eat
We shall try to maintain an updated list of accommodations, restaurants and eateries still serving, but cannot promise the validity of this data. It changes on a regular basis.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/special-stories/lockdown-in-nepal-a-glance-at-stress-factor-among-working-population/,"The world is engaged in the most serious “civil health war” due to the novel coronavirus in nearly 20-21 years and Nepal is also not left untouched with this global health crisis.
The situation is incomparable yet reminds us of the SARS epidemic that happened approximately 17 years back.
There is a race against the time in campaigning and preparing for the battle, such as:

Battlefields of science and technology
Research on the fastest detection
Development of vaccines
Research on new antivirus drugs to inhibit viruses
Rediscovery of some “old drugs”

Ways to formulate and implement the most effective public and clinical treatment and logistics support measures… and more
There is no doubt that the world will win the battle of this pandemic, and the victory is just around the corner in the next few weeks, even though we are being optimistic.

Science and technology war can be won or lost which will be witnessed in the coming time. The earliest epidemic prevention and control on “human to human” transmission of the disease has led to the closure of many cities in many countries around the globe.
This worldwide blockage has resulted in a heavy loss in the financial sector as well as other resources.
Ongoing Psychological Stress due to Lockdown
Many posted on social media that the people were tired earlier than usual.
During their working days, they usually stayed up late for a short time. But now during this lockdown, they started sleeping at 10 o’clock.
A lot of people are thinking, when we are doing less work but still getting tired, how can this be possible?
The fatigue/restlessness we experience is more likely to be related to the mental load associated with COVID-19 than the physical load we usually bear.
Fatigue has both physiological and non-physiological reasons. The physiological reason for fatigue is we rest after hardcore work or when we get sick.
But studies have also shown that fatigue can be caused by some physical as well as psychological conditions, such as stress and anxiety.
This pandemic made people confused and fearful. All these feelings lead to poor sleep quality, which in turn makes people more tired and anxious.
To break the cycle, exercise is a useful tool. Walking or taking an online exercise class can make you feel tired. But in the long run, it will reduce your fatigue as your sleep quality improves.

Planning and setting goals is now both possible and necessary. Set a future date for unblocking and be prepared to reset it if necessary. Being optimistic about the future and looking forward to it will also help reduce anxiety and fatigue.
I feel that people can think about adaptation and transition during the current LOCKDOWN situation.
It will take time but in stages!
The first week of adaptation involves breaking away from previous ways of life and work and building new interactions like getting close to your families which we didn’t do while we were busy with our job or work.

These are usually achieved on the fourth or fifth day when your mind starts getting habituated for staying at home talking to family members unlike office talks, after which life begins to become more stable and predictable.
During the first few weeks of homestay, extrovert people may feel depressed and may cry but the opposite goes for introvert people who feel like the golden opportunity of staying away from people. This is a normal adaptation phase.
Method of Adaptation
We shouldn’t worry too much, but rest assured that this will pass for most people and you will feel better next week.
The shift to a new environment can be helped by writing a reflective diary. It helps to write down your thoughts and feelings. Then you can review your progress and see how you adjust.
Full adaptation to the new lifestyle will take place in the next several months.
However, there is a time to realize that this can happen approximately three weeks after the start of homestay, when one may survive depression and low morale.
In this context, the fear is that the blockade/lockdown situation is now permanent but once that this stage is never going to over, the frustration might return.
The next lesson on how to maintain energy comes from observing people in a state of existence.
To avoid a state of apathy, depression, and lack of motivation, it is important to build a clear structure for your day. The plan gives us some control in life.
It helps prevent the accumulation of ‘leisure time’, which can make you very aware of realization and lead to a growing sense of drift.
This can make people feel isolated and indifferent, have a sound sleep, and do not neglect personal hygiene.

An extreme case of the living world shows that when we suddenly face this kind of epidemic situation, the survival instinct emerges.
And I appreciate the support that Nepalese people have shown for the lockdown.

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), a total of 4, 532 foreigners have been airlifted from Nepal through 34 international chartered flights from March 24 to April 23.
Even the Nepalis with the green card have left for Australia and the US during the period.

Nine airlines companies have conducted flights to Nepal. They include including Nepal Airlines, Titan Airways, Malindo Air, Shree Airlines, Sudan Airways, Buddha Air, Druk Air, and Himalayan Airlines.

The party has launched a website www.Work4Nepal.com to provide information and required assistance to the helpless Nepalis willing to return to Nepal.
The portal aims at connecting returning migrant workers with the employers in Nepal.

The party is set to help the migrant workers to gain employment opportunities in government and non-government organizations as per their skill set and expertise.
Meanwhile, the party representatives have already held discussions with the Nepali ambassadors in countries including Qatar, Oman, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and Egypt to understand the condition of Nepalis.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/coronavirus/investing-in-wash-to-prevent-covid-19/,"More Nepalis abroad than in Nepal have contracted and died from the coronavirus. At least 33 Nepalis in the UK, 15 in the United States, two in the United Arab Emirates, and one in Ireland have died from COVID-19.
Many hundreds more have fallen ill in 21 other countries, including Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Malaysia.
This highlights the fact that Nepal sends more labor migrants abroad, per capita, than any other country in South Asia. The virus’s impact on Nepalis outside the country could portend significant long-term difficulty for the Nepali economy.
At least for now, however, the coronavirus direct effects have been much milder in Nepal than in many other countries. As of April 29, there were only 57 cases, of whom 16 have recovered and no confirmed deaths reported.
This can be at least partly attributed to significant advances in Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH).

Nepal was declared free of open defecation on September 30, 2019. The Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) data shows that in 2018, 97% of the population had access to basic sanitation facilities. This is a huge leap from 1990 when only 6% of households had toilets.
Today, almost all citizens living in hill and mountain belts have some kind of access to toilets.
As important, 87% of people have access to basic water supplies. This is critical to the handwashing that helps prevent coronavirus and other illnesses.
But for all the gains made over the past two decades, more needs to be done.
While the overwhelming majority of people have access to water, 13% still lack it. And while most Nepalis have access to toilets, many of them are shared by multiple households.  While this is certainly preferable to open defecation, it is not sufficient to fully minimize risk.
As important, many of these water and toilet facilities need maintenance and repair. The 2015 earthquake damaged many WASH facilities, especially in rural areas. While people technically have access to them, in reality, many are difficult to use.
Further, there exists a continued need for education about how to properly use the sanitation and water facilities that are in good working order.
[Also Read: Japan Grants NPR 51.7 Mn to Nepal for WASH Project]
Many toilets in rural areas go unused or have even been turned into animal sheds.  While people have access to water, it is often in limited quantities, so people understandably prioritize drinking over handwashing.  Or people wash their hands, but without soap and proper drying.
All this can and is being addressed. For example, our organization works with community groups in five districts covering 49 rural communities to implement holistic development programs. Central to all these programs is WASH components tailored to the needs of each community.
Community members are regularly given educational classes on:

Treating water through filtration or boiling for drinking
Proper handwashing with soap
Menstrual health management
Waste management at the household and community level
Regular maintenance of toilets
Regular maintenance of public water taps

Also, we work with local partners to install handwashing stations with soap and proper drying facilities.  We have also introduced households to drying racks for dishes and utensils to eliminate placing these items on the ground to dry.
These are simple and inexpensive innovations with large results:

Reduction in water-borne diseases, especially diarrhea in children under five
Significant improvements among women in reproductive health issues
New and well-maintained toilets
Virtually no open defecation, even among children
Drinking water filtered or boiled and covered while storing
Community pathways clear of animal and other waste

The abrupt nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020, made it impossible for our organization and others to visit communities to conduct refresher classes on hand washing and related preventive measures. The good news is these communities were already prepared, so phone call reminders were sufficient.
People in the communities in which we work are doing what they should in terms of hygiene and sanitation to protect themselves and their neighbors from the coronavirus.

The major challenge in these rural communities is ‘social distancing‘.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 21.6% of those infected with the coronavirus in Wuhan, China were farmers and laborers.  Although the villages with which we work are scattered in terms of distance from one house to another, rural communities usually have public water taps. In toilets can be shared by four to five households.
Further, farmers must go to the field to work, tend to their livestock, and travel to local markets to sell their produce. This is all difficult to do in ways that maintain social distance.  Addressing this will likely require more significant government actions.

Before the coronavirus crisis, advances in water, sanitation, and hygiene have played a significant role in preventing life-threatening diseases and improving lives.  The pandemic has reinforced the need for better and sustainable community-managed WASH facilities.
Source: WHO
While private organizations like ours have a role to play, governments need to continue to invest in these basic human needs essential to sustained economic and social development.  Nepal has made so much progress in this area.
The coronavirus should be an impetus to do even more to improve health and living standards.

Buddha Jayanthi 2020, the 2564th birth anniversary of Gautam Buddha, is being celebrated by Buddhists and Nepalis across the country with utter devotion.
Buddha Jayanti, also known as Buddha Poornima, falls on Baishakh Shukla Purnima as per the lunar calendar, which is a full moon day.
Usually, Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, and other sacred places and monasteries across Nepal will be thronged with devotees on this day. Devotees visit two great stupas Swyambhunath and Boudhanath to honor Lord Buddha.

However, the 2020 Buddha Jayanti celebrations are quite different from the way it is celebrated so far.
The coronavirus pandemic has thrown a spanner in this year’s Buddha Poornima celebrations.

The coronavirus uproar in foreign countries has inflicted economic turmoil in Nepal.
Lockdowns, travel restrictions and social distancing have drastically interrupted global economic activities. This, in turn, has disrupted the inflow of remittances to small economies like Nepal that partially depend on their migrant workers.

According to the World Bank, Nepal received USD 8.64 billion in remittances (27.3% of GDP) in 2019, among the highest in South Asia.
However, a recent World Bank report has exclaimed that the remittances to Nepal could slump by around 14% or USD 1.2 billion in 2020.

The World Bank warned that the remittances across south Asian countries could drop by 22% due to coronavirus pandemic.
“With the IMF projecting a contraction in economies of the Gulf countries in 2020, hundreds of Nepalis are expected to lose their jobs and return home. This will affect the inflow of remittance,” said Nepal Rastra Bank Spokesperson Gunakar Bhatta.

According to the Nepali Government, around 1.5 million Nepalis are living in Malaysia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait. Around 225,000 Nepalis are in the UAE alone. Moreover, 3-4 million Nepalis are in India.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/business/covid-19-nepal-bullion-market-incurs-npr-7-mn-loss/,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt nearly every aspect of daily life in the global countries, including Nepal.
Even though Nepal has managed to control the spread of coronavirus in the country, it couldn’t withstand the socio-economic implications inflicted by the contagion.
Lately, the Nepali bullion market has incurred losses worth NPR 7 million due to the closure of business activities and nationwide lockdown.

Earlier on March 11, the bullion price recorded an all-time high of NPR 82,700 per tola due to the tensions between the US and China and trade war between the US and China.
Moreover, the gold price is anticipated to reach another historical record after the lockdown as the bullion price in the international market is regularly increasing at the moment.
The Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association (FeNeGoSiDA) Senior Vice President Manik Ratna Shakya claimed the gold price would climb over NPR 85,000 a tola after the lockdown.

Despite the festering conditions, the Nepali Government has not yet taken any decisions in favor of bullion market players.
“Despite submitting many letters to the concerned authorities, no specific decision has been taken in the name of gold traders,” exclaimed Shakya.
The FeNeGoSiDA has urged the Nepali Government to reduce loan interest rates, provide discounts on import taxes and offer relief packages for business continuity after lockdown.
The coronavirus pandemic has affected not only the traders but also the workers including goldsmiths and sales assistants.
According to the FeNeGoSiDA, around 210,000 people are involved in the bullion market in the country. They include:

80,000 traders
100,000 goldsmiths
30,000 sales assistants

As per the FeNeGoSiDA, the gold price has already increased by around 12% this year as the investors stopped their investments due to the COVID-19 uncertainty.

COVID-19 in Nepal
With the sudden surge in the coronavirus cases, the Nepali Government is scrambling for ways to contain the coronavirus spread.
Lately, the government has introduced a ‘COVID-19 Tracing and Tracking App’ to prevent and control the coronavirus in the country.
Deputy PM and Defence Minister Ishwar Pokhrel has inaugurated the COVID-19 mobile app by switching it on from the CCMC-Ops.

People can download the mobile app from the Google play store or by logging in to www.covid19.gov.np.
According to the app design team member Ram Prasad Dhungana, the real-time database-centric mobile application is developed on par with the international standards.
“The mobile app has both the features of tracking and tracing those suspected people who fill-up the form or answer the questions asked by the application,” said Dhungana.
However, the user should switch on Bluetooth in their mobile while using the application so that the user’s real condition can be identified.
The application users will be categorized into green, yellow or red zones as per the details entered by them.

The Ministry of Home Affairs will monitor and store all the data and individual records of the mobile application users at the Government Integrated Data Centre (GIDC).

https://www.nepalisansar.com/education/nepal-mandates-see-exams-amidst-covid-19/,"Putting a stop to all the speculations, the Nepali National Examination Board (NEB) has reiterated its decision to conduct the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
It said that the ‘SEE examinations are mandatory’ as students cannot be promoted to the next level based on the internal assessment by the schools.
During a video conference by Education Journalist Network (EJON) Nepal, NEB Chair Prof. Dr. Chandra Mani Poudel said that the prevalent provisions in the Education Act have made SEE compulsory.
“We have to abide by the prevalent legal provisions and cannot defy them. We are the authority to work as per the prevalent regulations and will conduct the exam as provisioned,” said Poudel.
He assured the students that at least two weeks would be given for preparation and reaching the exam centers.
However, the NEB has not announced the new exam schedule as uncertainty prevails around COVID-19.

“Although the situation seems under control in some places, it may go worse again. Hence, it’s difficult to tell the date of the exam,” exclaimed Poudel.
Meanwhile, the Nepali Government is planning various ways to conduct exams like conducting exams in phases or placing exam centers at convenient places for the students.
Earlier, the government has allocated 1995 exam centers. However, a recent analysis has shown that 727 more centers were required to conduct examinations following social distancing in the exam hall.
So far, Nepal has reported 121 coronavirus infection cases. However, 31 patients were discharged after recovery.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/special-stories/a-sleepless-night-for-a-ray-of-hope/,"“I’ll drop Suju to his boarding school on my motorbike. Reema will assist me in running our grocery shop.” Krishna lost in his colorful imagination lying on the cemented ‘chautari’.
The Sun was slowly setting down the horizon. By that time, he had not managed to procure eggs and pulses, which Reema had asked him to get it for their only child, Suju. The chirping of birds returning to their nests distracted him. Krishna disheartened.
He was supposed to take food to his family after he returned from the furniture shop, where he works.
It had just been a week since he received his salary. But, it was already consumed, with which he bought Reema a new sari and a cycle for Suju. The amount to be paid to the shop has already mounted and the shopkeeper had warned Krishna to deal only in cash.
Krishna, with a dreadful face, stepped towards the shop with only a 50 rupees note in his pocket. Krishna didn’t have enough money to buy what he was supposed to. He asked the shopkeeper to give him a kilogram of pulses and 5 eggs, showing the 50 rupees note he had.
The shopkeeper grumbled that the money is insufficient for what he wanted to buy. Krishna, after handing him the money, requested the shopkeeper to add the remaining money to his account. The shopkeeper denied. With a heavy heart, he reached home with just a couple of eggs and half a kilogram of pulses.
There were only two eggs for the family of three. It was Krishna who didn’t eat. Maybe his paunch was packed with some other stuff. Maybe with poverty?
That night, Krishna’s mind quizzed. He asked a lot of questions to himself, but in reply, silence followed the tears. Krishna consoled himself, saying “Good days will come”, but suddenly raises a question within as to “When will they come?” 
Had his father saved the land and property, he could have spared this suffering. His father died of liver failure a years ago due to excessive consumption of alcohol. What little savings he had were spent on the treatment of his alcoholic father. That was the money he had saved to pursue the dream to fly to Qatar and earn a decent living for his family.
The night was passing miserably for Krishna. Tomorrow, he has to buy healthy food, full of protein, for his little son Suju.

Suju was not as strong as other kids. He has been suffering from growth hormone deficiency since he was 3 years old. Krishna’s promise to buy her mistress a necklace seemed to fade from his memory. It was on her last birthday, he had promised. But he could only afford a sari with his money.
At 11:43 PM, Krishna wrapped out Khukuri cigarette and pushed himself towards the balcony. The very first puff of cigarette warmed his cold heart but did not last long. The last smoke mixed up with the clouds and anguish, making him heartsick. He usually hears to clattering on the first floor, but that was not quite enough to distract his mind that was full of frustration. He gets lost in his thoughts suddenly.
“What about my dream of going to Qatar and opening a grocery store after I return?….What about my dream of buying a motorcycle and dropping my son to his boarding school on the motorbike?”…..One after the other, these questions arose in his mind. And, they seemed to never end. 
His alcoholic father had sold away all their lands to pay the debt, even the slightest gleam of hope dimmed with all his land sold. Given his schooling only till the 6th standard, a decent job was hard to come by. He has been earning meals for his family with his chore of splinting the logs in a furniture shop. Neither Reema was that literate to get a five-figure income monthly.
Reema had been working as a peon of the school near their house. She somehow manages a little money by working all day to assist her husband, Krishna.
The roof could not seal the water as it started to drizzle. A little drop of water splashed on Krishna’s wrist. He pulled himself back to get rid of those water droplets. It was 1:10 AM already. 
By that time, the whole world was supposed to be in a pleasant sleep, dreaming. Checking a cigarette in his pocket, he rested himself on the floor. The little drizzle was turning into a rainstorm with time. It had been 5 years since he last repaired his house.
Every summer, their family of three shared a single bed on the ground floor to avoid the disturbance caused by the rain and the hailstorm upstairs. The rain was getting heavier followed by the hailstorm.
Despite the turmoil in the background, Krishna felt lost in silence. He drew out the last stick of cigarette from his pocket to control his annoyance. But, how can a cigarette resist the ache felt in his senses? The water drops falling in front of him fuelled his trauma, increasing his urge to repair the roof.
“How can I manage to fix this rusty house?” he asked self, with another question overshadowing the previous one. How can I think of repairing the house when there’s no food to eat tomorrow? he mourned. 
The cigarette had already stopped generating smoke, but the questions in his mind never stopped arising.
“Suju will grow up one day. He must have a good education to compete with people around the globe. He may even demand a motorcycle when he grows up.”…..One after another, these thoughts bothered him.
The clock struck 4:00 AM. Krishna, wiping the tears with his old muddy shirt, stood on his feet. Lights were getting turned on all over. He trudged aiming for his bed.
Now, he has to sleep well and strive in the early morning in order to feed his son, Suju and wife, Reema.
Now, its already 7:00 AM! Myna’s chirping sounded as an alarm. As usual, he woke up after the sharp tone struck his ears.

The Sun has risen along with his hope. Krishna strides towards the furniture shop, as usual, bidding a good-bye to his loved ones.

Export revenues from products listed in the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS) have dropped by 17.57% year-on-year in the first 11 months of the current FY 2019/20.
During the period from mid-July to mid-June, the shipments of the NTIS products were valued at NPR 17.83 billion, down from NPR 21.63 billion in the previous fiscal.

“The export scenario was on track for eight to nine months, then the lockdown following the virus outbreak created havoc in Nepal’s trade,” said Sharad Bikram Rana, Executive Director of the Trade and Export Promotion Centre.
The products under NTIS include cardamom, pashmina, tea, ginger, medicinal and aromatic plants, fabric, textile, yarn and rope, carpet, and footwear.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/immigration/nepal-to-repatriate-migrant-workers-at-free/,"The Nepali Government has finalized the guidelines for repatriating the migrant workers stranded in foreign countries at its own expense.
The government will repatriate the workers through the Migrant Workers’ Welfare Fund as per the Supreme Court order.
Earlier on June 15, the Supreme Court has ordered the government to immediately repatriate those workers who are unable to pay for their airfares to return home.
According to the repatriation guidelines, the Nepali Government will bear the repatriation expenses based on the condition of the Nepali workers.
“The government will be bearing 100% expenses of the workers who had been to the foreign labour countries for less than a year and are unable to return home,” said Suman Ghimire, a Spokesperson for the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security.

The government will pay only 50% of the repatriation cost for those workers who have been in labor destination countries for more than a year.
However, the migrant workers should have a valid labor permit from the Nepali Government and the proof that their employer is not paying for their airfare.
Moreover, the government will consider the workers’ income during the period of their employment before their repatriation.
The concerned Nepali Embassies will ascertain whether the migrant workers were stranded without money after they lost their jobs, or being unpaid by their employers and did not receive any support from elsewhere.
The workers who had already returned home with their own expenses can also claim for reimbursement by filing their applications with the Department of Foreign Employment (DoFE).
In turn, the department will send the applications to the concerned embassies for verification before approving the reimbursement.
According to the DoFE, around 25,000 Nepalis are willing to return home from various countries, especially from the Persian Gulf states and Malaysia.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/government/locust-swarm-sweeps-into-52-nepali-districts-27-hit-hard/,"Nepal is witnessing its worst locust invasion in decades amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The swarms of locusts that entered Nepal on June 27 from India have spread to 52 districts of the country.
According to the Information Officer at the Plant Quarantine and Pesticide Management Center, Ram Krishna Subedi, around 7 to 8 million locusts have already entered Nepal.
Among them, only 3.5 million are active in damaging the crops, mostly maize and vegetables. Of the remaining, a large section was diverted into the jungle due to wind, while some have died after attacking each other.
Among the 52 districts, 27 districts including Rukum, Rolpa, Makwanpur, Dang, Pyuthan, Palpa, Chitwan, Kapilvastu, Rupandehi, and Kailali have suffered significant crop damage due to locusts.
According to Subedi, the swarm of locusts that entered Rupandehi is the largest of all, which consisted of 2 to 2.5 million.

In response, all the local and state governments are on high alert by mobilizing technical teams to control the possible loss due to the locusts.
However, according to the Center, the country is likely to witness another locust swarm in the next few days.
A locust swarm that is currently in Indian border areas Bhagalpur and Motihari might head towards the Champaran district of Nepal.
Informing that the wind direction from East to West might bring the swarm into Nepal, the Nepali Government has urged people from Tarai, inner-Tarai valleys and lower hilly areas to stay alert.
“Flowers and plants can be protected from the swarm if they are covered properly and crops cultured inside the tunnel can be protected by using lace. The damage to paddy fields can be minimized by collecting water in the paddy fields,” said Subedi.
Even though the scattered swarm has caused little damage to the crops so far, experts insist that a considerable swarm might enter Nepal, causing significant damage to the crops.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/education/nepal-grade-11-and-12-new-curriculum-2076-released/,"As a new turn in the policy and structure of school-level education in Nepal, the Curriculum Development Center (CDC) has released a new curriculum for Grade 11 and 12 from the academic year 2020/21.
The CDC has developed the new curriculum under the guidance of the Nepali Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.
The new curriculum made English, Nepali and Social Studies compulsory in the 11th grade and English, Nepali and Life Skill in the 12th grade.
However, the number of optional subjects for both the grades will remain the same, i.e., three.
Earlier, both the grade 11 and 12 had only two compulsory subjects, English and Nepali.
Moreover, the new curriculum has eliminated the stream-based education system that includes Ten Plus Two (+2) Science, Management, Humanities, Law, and Education.

With the new decision, as many as seven subjects, five compulsory and two options, will be taught in Grade XI and XII from the next academic session.
Meanwhile, the CDC has decided to prepare and publish the textbooks only through the Janak Education Material Center, breaking the trend of allowing publications by private institutes.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/government/nepal-intra-party-disputes-ncp-leaders-demand-pm-olis-resignation/,"While the world governments are striving to control and prevent the coronavirus pandemic, the Nepali Government is reportedly indulging in political issues.
The inadequate healthcare facilities and improper management of quarantine centers have put Nepal at a higher risk of coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, the intra-party disputes in the country are making the situation worse.
What PM Oli has been long attempting to avoid has finally come as the top leaders from the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) have demanded him to resign as both prime minister and party chairman.
During the Standing Committee meeting on Tuesday, Executive Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, senior leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, and Bam Dev Gautam, have demanded Oli to step down from power.

A total of at least 18 Standing Committee members sought PM Oli’s resignation claiming that he had failed to run the government and the party effectively.
“Not only Dahal, all Standing Committee members who spoke today univocally demanded Oli’s resignation from both the party chair and the government saying that he cannot run both,” said former PM Khanal.
Though the meeting was supposed to be focused on the coronavirus pandemic response, the agenda was diverted by the Prime Minister’s recent controversial statements on India.
Earlier on June 28, Prime Minister KP Oli stated that the forces within Nepal and India were conspiring to oust him from power in an apparent bid to take revenge against his resolute move to endorse a new political map.
“I have come to know that meetings and seminars were being organized in India against Nepal’s decision to amend the constitution by incorporating the revised map in the coat of arms,” said PM Oli.

These remarks have drawn huge criticism and confusion among the party leaders and the public.
As soon as the meeting was started on Tuesday, Chairman Dahal slammed PM Oli for his controversial remarks on Sunday.
“The PM’s remarks that India was conspiring to remove him were neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate,” he said.
“You have tarnished the image of the party by speaking against India. International relations cannot be balanced by fighting with India,” Dahal told PM Oli.
“PM Oli has lost the moral ground to lead the government and the party after his recent remarks. It is time for him to step down from power to pave the way for others,” said leaders during the meeting.

https://www.nepalisansar.com/us-nepalis/nepal-to-reassess-us-mcc-compact-start-date/,"Given the repeated delays in parliamentary ratification of the MCC Compact, the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal (MCA-Nepal) is striving to reassess the Entry into Force (EiF) date for the agreement.
MCA-Nepal, the government agency formed to manage the grant, is working with all the concerned authorities to complete the preconditions required before starting the EiF date officially.
The agency also considered the global coronavirus pandemic as a reason impeding the process of the compact.
According to the MCA-Nepal, June 30, 2020 is the EiF date. However, the intra-party disputes simmering inside the main ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) over the much-talked US grant has led to persistent delays in tabling the legislation to ratify the MCC Compact agreement.
The deferral of the meeting of the HoR until July 1 has further made it impossible to reach the target to start the EiF date.
Under the compact, the US Government will provide USD 500 million in grant while Nepal will invest USD 130 million to implement the Electricity Transmission Project (ETP) and the Road Maintenance Project (RMP).
However, the unutilized funds of the compact will return to the US if the projects are not finished within five years of the EiF date.

Availability of MCC Is Not Open-ended: US
Due to the delays in parliamentary ratification of the MCC, the US Government has clarified that it cannot indefinitely wait for Nepal to make the final decision on the 500 million grants.
“Accepting this grant is Nepal’s choice, but the availability of the funding is not open-ended. Tangible, near-term steps in Nepal are necessary to ensure the continued viability of the program,” said the US Embassy in Kathmandu on Monday.

The statement comes amid the growing speculations that the US Government is exerting pressure on Nepal to accept the grant.
The US embassy further clarified that delay in ratification would delay the benefits of employment opportunities and improved economic growth for nearly 23 million Nepalis.
It also brushed aside the speculations that the MCC has a hidden agenda.

“MCC’s transparency as a development partner is also recognized globally. This year, MCC was once again ranked as the top bilateral donor in the Aid Transparency Index,” said the US Embassy.
