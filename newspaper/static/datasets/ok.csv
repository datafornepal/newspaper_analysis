Kathmandu, January 31
The central bank is preparing to conduct a biannual review of this fiscal year’s monetary policy as the first half has recently been over. A senior official at the Nepal Rastra Bank says the review will begin next week.
He reveals that the review will address multiple concerns that the stakeholders have been raising.
In particular, commercial banks, financial institutions and automobile entrepreneurs are keeping an eye on the review. Recently, the Nepal Bankers Association, a group of commercial banks, had submitted a memorandum to the central bank demanding amendments to some of the provisions of the policy. The bankers have also consulted Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada in this regard.
Likewise, auto entrepreneurs want the central bank to relax its provision on auto loans. Sources say the minister is already convinced on the demand.
Meanwhile, the central bank has hinted that it can partially address the demands.",/business,"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 06:23:53 +0000"

Kathmandu, January 29
The government-run fuel distribution monopoly, Nepal Oil Corporation, has withdrawn from its proposal to open a pipeline from Motihari of India to Chitwan of Nepal for the transport of liquified petroleum gas.
After the successful operation of the petroleum pipeline from Motihari to Amalekhgunj, the corporation had floated the proposal and India had also expressed its interest. However, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli opposed the plan saying Nepal was preparing its own alternative to replace the cooking gas, forcing the corporation to drop the plan.
Stating that the government had a plan to promote electricity production in the country, the prime minister reportedly told the officials, “Let’s focus on the transport and storage of petrol and diesel only. The alternative to gas will be ready in our own country.”
While floating a proposal to extend the petroleum pipeline up to Lothar of Chitwan, the corporation had also proposed establishing a parallel pipeline for the LPG supply.",/business,"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 08:11:14 +0000"

Kathmandu, January 29
The government on Tuesday appointed Dhananjay Regmi as the chief executive officer of Nepal Tourism Board, the government authority dedicated to developing the lucrative industry of the country. As Regmi starts off his four-year tenure, he has the challenge to make the ambitious Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign a success.
A selection panel led by Kedar Bahadur Adhikari, the secretary at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, unanimously appointed him to the position. Besides him, eight others including the immediate past CEO Deepak Raj Joshi had filed applications for the position. Last week, the government had shortlisted three after a written test and interviews.
Who is Regmi?
Regmi is a tourism and environment ‘campaigner’. He was educated in the United States and Japan. In the past, he also taught geography at Tribhuvan University and Budhanilakantha School in Kathmandu.
Of late, Regmi has been working as a consultant for various projects related to environment and climate change. He is also a businessman. He owns various enterprises in auto, tourism and hospitality industries. He has also invested in a few hydropower projects.
He is interested in lowering the outburst risk of glacial lakes by utilising the water there to produce electricity. Regmi says he has been studying if it is possible in Nepal.
Though Regmi was involved in the student wing of the then CPN-UML in the past, he is not a political figure. However, he is believed to have sympathy for the ruling Nepal Communist Party.",/business,"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 03:09:25 +0000"

After the death of eight Indian tourists at a hotel in Daman of Makawanpur district last week, the Hotel Association Nepal has told its members to completely abide by the government standards introduced for hotels and resorts.
The government has recently issued a new set of rules for hotels and other hospitality facilities. The standards are different for different categories.
Concluding that the Daman-based hotel’s inability to provide air conditioners forced the visitors to use heaters during the nighttime and they caused asphyxiation, the association urged the facilities to implement the standards strictly, though one week after the incident.

Just two weeks after Nepal enthusiastically inaugurated the ambitious Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign with a target of bringing in at least two million foreign tourists in one year, seven people including four foreigns went missing in an avalanche in the Annapurna trekking region.
A few days after that, eight Indian national died of asphyxiation as they switched on a heater to warm the room before going to bead at a poorly equipped hotel in Daman of Makawanpur district, near Kathmandu.
Whereas many have thought these incidents would have an adverse impact on the country’s wish to aggressively promote the tourism industry. Concerned officials and entrepreneurs alike also view that these incidents have become alarms to them.
Rudra Singh Tamang, the spokesperson at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, however, maintains that the government is serious about avoiding such incidents in the future. “There are many works being done to give a message that Nepal is a safe destination.”
The entrepreneurs, however, are more worried. “Such incidents apparently affect tourist arrival. The government’s role should be more active in such situations,” he says.
Meanwhile, some stakeholders view that the absence of the chief executive officer at Nepal Tourism Board would also affect the campaigning.

The telecommunications regulatory body of the country, Nepal Telecommunications Authority, has directed telephone service providers to decrease the charge they impose on inter-network calls. The directive will come into effect on April 2.
The authority recently issued the Interconnection Guideline requiring the companies to decrease the charge. The authority’s spokesperson and director Min Prasad Aryal says the customers can directly benefit from the new rule. “After it is implemented, companies earn more profit. Based on that, they have to decrease the call tariff.”
Whereas other interconnection charges have been slashed, the guideline has increased the cost of calling a landline number from a mobile phone.

As many as 20 pilots of the national flag carrier, Nepal Airlines Corporation, have warned of resigning in masse, urging the management to end the discrimination they have been facing.
The pilots have claimed that there is a gap between facilities and services given to them and other foreign pilots recruited by the government-run corporation on contract. They have given the management three months’ time to meet the demand, threatening they would quit otherwise.
The ‘resignation notice’ dated January 17 was registered at the NAC Office of the Executive Chairman on Thursday evening.
“The management is happy in hiring expensive expatriate pilots or pilots on contract with a much higher salary,” the letter reads, “But nothing has been done to replace such expensive pilots with its own in-house pilots or to increase the salary and benefits of its permanent pilots.”

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kaira-movie-review-an-average-love-story-to-avoid.html,"
With the onset of monsoon, there are a lot of romantic movies being released in Kathmandu. After Romeo and Muna failed to attract the crowd last week, it was the Aryan Sigdel-starrer Kaira that tested its luck at the multiplexes in the Valley and around the country.
The romantic movie revolves around two characters Jay (Aryan Sigdel) and Kaira (Samragee Shah) who accidentally meet at a bar in Kathmandu. In a topsy-turvy journey, both seem to be ‘lucky’ in all matters except for romantic relationships. The story takes a turn when both of them meet in the Philippines where their love story deepens. What happens next changes and both an emotional ride begins.
The first half of the movie was quite engaging with the director showing the audience how the two characters met and the story behind the growth of their friendship. The half was gripping but there seemed to be something missing as the director tried to show a lot of things. Like most Nepali movies, Kaira too didn’t have an element of surprise–the story Was quite predictable.
The second half of the film failed to live up to expectations and lost its audience halfway through. The story got a bit intense and sad but it was over-stretched.

One good thing that stands out in the movie is the acting. It shows how much the actors have worked on getting their role right. Shah is good and so is as Kaira. Her acting is good, especially in the emotional scenes where she’s poised and natural. I didn’t think she Samragyee had it in her to play such an emotional role.
Sigdel, like always, is natural and calm throughout the film. His dialogue delivery, along with his expressions, is good. What is commendable is the flawless chemistry between the duo.
Other actors like Shishir Rana, Hitesh Sharma, Tsuresh Neupane and Marisha Shrestha are not as natural as the main cast but have complimented the two.
What is poor is the script which seems to have been inspired by a lot of Bollywood and Hollywood flicks. The story is quite good and gripping, but the way it has been presented is poor and shows a lack of originality. The screenplay does not do justice to the story which makes it a bit of a drag and makes the audience wish it was over as many left before the film ended. If not for the actors’ hard work, the movie would have been a poor watch as there a lot of faults with the planning of scenes and sequences throughout the film.
The songs are good as they feature a host of good singers such as Sugam Pokharel, Yubraj Chaulagain, Ketan Chhetri and Shreya Sotang. The cinematography is exemplary with Shivaram Shrestha capturing all the beautiful places in the Philippines elegantly. The wardrobe used is quite good too except for a few scenes in which you feel that Sigdel’s dress up is a bit over the top.
Overall, the movie is borderline average. Having expected so much from it, it disappoints.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kaala-movie-review-rajni-steals-the-show.html,"
South Indian movies being screened in a Kathmandu multiplex is a rare site.  Apart from Bahubali, not many have done well when shown to the public. But at a time when Nepali movies aren’t doing good business, bringing Rajnikant starrer Kaala seems like a no brainer.
The movie revolves around Kaala (Rajnikant), the don who rules one of the slums of Mumbai named Dharavi. Due to its central location, many builders want to take over the land and promise the people migrated from Tamil Nadu new houses. But the story takes a turn when Kaala sees the plans of these builders and opposes them. This makes him a prime target of the builders and a local politician Hari Dada (Nana Patekar) who want to eliminate him in order to get the land.
The first half of the movie is engaging and intense. It focuses on how we believe that by destroying, we can develop a case that has been seen here in Nepal too. It shows the hardships of the people who live in the slum. It shows how the people are brainwashed into selling their houses in return for fake promises.
The second half, even though it has a lot of action, is less engaging than the first as the audience can predict most of what is to come. The ending is a bit confusing and could have been better but the movie does end on a positive note giving the audience plenty to think about.

Superstar Rajni is superb like he was in his previous movie Kabali in which he was fighting for the rights of Tamil workers in Malaysia. His acting is natural and has that certain charisma that he has always shown. He has helped the director sell the movie which focuses more on the people of the slum than Rajnikant. But that said, Rajni is flawless, particularly in the action scenes on a fly over in which he rolls back the year and that too in slow motion with an umbrella in hand.
Nana Patekar as Hari Dada, the corrupt politician, is quite superb. He is natural and has played the role of an antagonist with grace. His confrontations with Kaala are terrific to watch, particularly the part in which he refuses to drink water in Kaala’s house.
Zareena (Huma Qureshi) who plays the role of Kaala’s ex-girlfriend and a social worker has also performed very well. Her acting is powerful and the chemistry between her and Rajnikant is worth admiring.
Eeshwari Rao (As Kaala’s wife) and Anjali Patil (As Kaala’s son’s girlfriend), also put in noteworthy performances.
The background score has been well planned and is quite good along with the songs in the movie which have been timed well but could have been a bit short.
The cinematography is brilliant as all action scenes are flawless. George Williams gives the film a polish that makes it very slick.
Kala is a movie that stars Rajnikant, but is not a movie about him or his character. It’s a movie about the people of Dharavi and how they make ends meet by doing manual labour. It’s a story about how the blue coloured people help maintain the city and how the city fails to function without them.
Most Rajini fans might find Kaala a bit dull. But the nearly three-hour film has the potential to grow on those many audacious departures from the norm. Kaala is a film for the people and the fact that Rajnikant is there is just a bonus.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hari-movie-review-this-artistic-experiment-may-not-sell-in-cheesy-market.html,"
For a second week running, Nepali movie lovers have been treated with a movie that producers hardly consider making. Producers normally make movies which are either funny or are full of cheesy love stories because they know that these movies will sell and their investment is safe.
Breaking that trend, filmmakers have come up with a different movie which is sure to give the audience a new experience.
The movie Hari revolves around Bishnu Hari (Bipin Karki), a religious man in his early 30s who lives with his mother Parvati (Sunita Thakur). Hari’s life is pretty laid back as he has no worries, apart from his receding hairline and an oversmart colleague at work. The story takes a turn a bird ‘shits’ on his head, which also brings bad luck to his life.
The first half of the movie establishes Hari as the lead character. It gives the audience an insight into Hari’s monotonous life and his family history. Like the trailer, it’s abrupt and fails to answer many questions. Apart from a few jokes, the half is not very engaging as there is a feel that something big is going to happen in the second half of the film.
The second half though is just a continuation of the slow first half which fails to grab the audience’s attention but does get better with its various twists and turns. The fact that the directors have connected the characters helps the audience make sense of this playlike movie.
Bipin Karki, the star of this movie, had said this movie gave him artistic pleasure and he has done his role justice. He’s almost ever present in all scenes as he has played five roles in the movie, but there are times one feels he has performed better when not being Hari. The movie starts and ends with him and if you’re not his fan, you best not watch the movie.

Over the years, the audience has seen Karki in many roles as he has established himself as a versatile actor. We’ve seen him as Bindu in Chhadke, Bhasme Don in Pashupati Prassad, Pittal in Loot 2 and Goldie Don in Naakaa, but his role in Hari stands out from his previous roles.
Thinley Lhamo in her second Nepali movie has done well. Even though she has no dialogues, her emotions and expressions stand out. Sunita Thakur, who plays Hari’s mother, has given a stellar performance too along with Kamal Mani Nepal, who plays the role of Hari’s adversary naturally.
Safal KC and Pratik Gurung have done a good job with the direction as they have planned out most shots very well and the lighting is particularly noteworthy.
The story, however, could have been better. Although both KC and Gurung have tried to keep the audience hooked, the slow presentation makes it hard not to use the phone time and again.
The cinematography is what keeps the movie alive. Chintanraj Bhandari has captured most scenes very well and there is hardly anything bad one can point out.
Overall the movie is a good watch if one watches it with an open mind. If you’re looking for something entertaining, then there are other movies in the multiplexes you can watch. But if you’re looking to watch a unique Nepali movie with an artistic touch, Hari should definitely be on your list as this is more like play than a movie.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sunkesari-movie-review-predictable-and-boring.html,"
There was a lot of hype surrounding Sunkesari but the movie has failed to live up to that hype mainly because of its poor storyline and script.
Having watched the producers and actors promote the movie so vigorously, many would have thought the movie would change the way people look at Nepali movies. But after watching Sunkesari the audience would have realised that Nepali movies disappoint more often than others.
The ‘horror’ movie is set in a mansion-turned-boutique-hotel in Australia where Sunkesari (Reecha Sharma) goes to take a break from her sad life. Yadav (Rabindra Jha) a housemaid is the only person in the huge mansion which seems to be haunted. Soon Sunkesari is joined by two more guests Rupen (Sunny Dhakal) and Emma (Lauren Lofberg) after which strange paranormal events begin to unfold.
The start of the movie is abrupt, clichéd and fails to give context. The start is decent but the writer and director Arpan Thapa fails to explain what is happening and why it is happening. The first half gradually gets better thanks to Rabindra Jha’s acting but the filmmakers have failed to scare the audience even though they have used loud sounds and spooky background sound.
The second half of the film has been rushed. With a runtime of 1 hour and 30 minutes, the movie fails to explain a number of things such as the background story of Rupen and Sunkesari.

The acting in the movie isn’t that great either. Sharma as Sunkesari is par and has delivered a flat performance. She seems to be lost and her turning into the ghost is so unnatural that it will make you laugh–especially when she ‘levitates’.
The movie introduces a foreign actor Lauren Lofberg who seems to have done a decent job but again the writing doesn’t help her. Thapa doesn’t seem to have thought about how to incorporate a foreign character before writing the film. But Lofberg as a ghost looks good and far more convincing than Sharma is.
Jha as Yadav is the most entertaining character in the film without whom the movie would have been a drag. The rest of the characters are unnatural and lack identity. The two ghost girls are good as they have done justice to their roles.
The cinematography is good along with the location and is the only thing that makes you feel that you’re watching a horror movie. The movie has been shot by both Nepali and foreigners–both seem to have done a good job to make sure the movie gave a spooky feel.
The writing though was poor and cliched as Thapa offers nothing new. He seems to have rushed the movie from start to finish as he fails to explain many plots. There are two songs in the film which are out of place, pointless and extremely unnatural. Maybe watching too many Bollywood horror movies made the director put them in the film.
Overall the movie fails to live up to the expectation. Its predictable and that makes it funny. The people in the hall were extremely disappointed as they expected more. The movie with his impressive promotion might have done well at the box office but its success there will not make the movie great.
There are signs that there will be a sequel but how many will watch it after such a disappointing prequel is a question for the filmmakers to answer.
P.S.: A+ for the effort.

Superhero movies are making money these days. After the success of Black Panther and Avengers Infinity War, Marvel Studios have come up with yet another superhero movie which is sure to tickle all your funny bones thanks to Ryan Reynolds’ superb performance as ‘Deadpool’.
Deadpool 2, like its predecessor, revolves around the story of a foul-mouthed mutant mercenary Wade Wilson aka ‘Deadpool’ (Reynolds) who has lost everything. He tries to bring together a team of fellow mutant rogues to protect a young boy blessed with supernatural abilities from the brutal, time-travelling mutant, Cable. But the story takes a dramatic turn when Cable has a change of heart. The events that follow will surely surprise everyone.
The first instalment of Deadpool didn’t seem to please the critics with its humour and to rectify that, the new movie has a bit more than just humour. The sequel has a better storyline and that makes this movie better than the first one as it shows the other side of the persona of Deadpool.
The story flows from start to finish. There is no confusion and the humour compliments the good storyline. The first movie had a lot of pop culture references which were hard to understand. But this one has better jokes (still inappropriate), which people can relate to. And this one also offers surprising depth and handles the story of the troubled teenage character with grace.
Reynolds as Deadpool is hilarious. It seems like he has learned from his first movie and added something more to his acting than just jokes. He showed that even a troubled superhero like him can have emotions and is particularly good in the second half of the film.

Julian Dennison as Firefist is good and delivers a stellar performance as a tough teenager who’s been dealt a rough hand at an orphanage.
Josh Brolin as a mutant from the future is just as good but if you look at it the movie is all about Reynolds as you can’t take your eye (and ears) off him.
The action scenes are quite brilliant throughout the movie (not that it was any worse in the first movie). Some scenes do look painful and the fact that the censor board hasn’t cut the film too much makes it much better.
For the brilliant action sequences, we can thank director David Leitch who has specialised in action films after his hit movies Atomic Blond and John Wick. You can expect the same hyper-real fantasia of the first film. Leitch and Reynolds (who also contributes as a writer) throw everything at it as they let your imagination wander.
If you liked the first movie, you’ll surely enjoy watching this one as it offers the same humour but on a larger scale.

PS: Don’t miss the post-credits and yea please leave your kids at home!

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/lamphoo-movie-review-boring-presentation-of-a-common-mans-struggle.html,"
Nepali movies are full of surprises. One doesn’t know what to expect from them. The trailers give out very little as one can expect numerous twists and turns while watching one. But Kabir Khadka starrer Lamphoo is a movie that can be judged by its trailer. Like the trailer, the movie is abrupt, haphazard and downright boring.
Lamphoo revolves around Ramesh (Kabir Khadka), a carefree unemployed boy in the town of Kusma. Looking at where he is going, his parents constantly nag him and don’t let him peruse his dream which leaves him frustrated. He is fed up with life and spends with his friends who constantly get him into trouble. But his life changes when he meets Aarati (Mariska Pokhrel) who desperately wants him to change the way he lives life.
But that doesn’t go as planned, as he is tricked by his friends because of whom he has to leave the girl and the town and go to Kathmandu where his life changes drastically when he gets into the trap of selfish people. There are only two ways left for Ramesh, either surrender or fight with them.
The movie starts abruptly. It feels like a few scenes are randomly put together as it lacks proper planning and execution. The first half is extremely long and pretty avoidable. It focuses on Ramesh and his bid to get Aarati to like him which stretches so long the audience stops paying attention and the interval comes as a welcome break.
The long first half results in a confusing second half, which makes one wonder if the filmmakers themselves watched the movie before releasing it. It is full of twists and turns, but that makes the audience scratch their heard wondering what exactly is going on.
The script is poor and has been written by someone who clearly lacks experience. The director hasn’t been helped by the script, but the way he has introduced so many characters in such an abrupt manner makes one question his ability as well.
The actors are average. Khadka is decent as lead but the way he is presented is quite odd and apart from his chemistry with his little brother, there is nothing good to talk about.
Pokharel in the movie is decent, but she could have been better especially while portraying emotions in the film. Her chemistry with Khadka is poor.
Salon Basnet, who is introduced as Lekin in the second half, fails to live up to expectations. He has tried to lighten the mood with his witty acting, but at times goes over the top with his acting. That said, he is the only actor in the movie who has done a good job.
Sanjit Bhandari is poor as Dipak, a rich businessman. His acting is unnatural and his chemistry with Chandani Sharma is quite poor.

The movie also has a special cameo for ‘Tarkariwali’, Kusum Shrestha, whose photo of carrying vegetables had gone viral last year. She doesn’t have a big role and appears in a few shots making it obvious that her name has been used for promotion purposes.
Director Gopal Chandra Lamichhane is particularly off with his direction. He has haphazardly introduced characters and has also failed to explain few plots especially after the climax which seems to have been rushed.  He also randomly adds songs to the movie which is the primary reason that the movie is so long.
The cinematographer is just poor, particularly during the action scenes which have not been planned well. There are a few blurred and shaky shots along with a night shot where one of the characters is barely visible.
Above all, the flow of the script prepared by Bhupati is weak and it is evident that he clearly needs to work on his dialogues if he wants to do well as a scriptwriter. What these writers need to learn is how and where to add English into a Nepali film. The use of English in this movie is odd and very unnatural.
The only saving grace are the songs which are quite nice and are doing well but their placement in the film is out of place.
To sum up, the movie is not worth a watch. It’s a movie that will give aspiring actors a hope that even they can someday make it in this industry which doesn’t seem to be evolving.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/damaru-ko-dandibiyo-movie-review-remembering-the-forgotten-sport.html,"
 
Nepali movies these days have a similar storyline that revolves around money. If it isn’t about money, it is about mimicking films made in India or abroad. Most of the producers fear of losing money–no one wants to think outside the box and break the trend.
However, once in a while a movie comes along to challenge this. Damaru Ko Dandibiyo, which was released across Nepal on Friday, is one movie that brings in a gust of fresh air into the cinema industry.
Damaru ko Dandibiyo revolves around the forgotten sport of dandibiyo. Damaru (Khagendra Lamichhane) returns to his village with an aim to revive dandibiyo. But his father, once a reputed dandibiyo player, opposes him and tells him to concentrate on his career.
Damaru is left with no option but to defeat his father in a dandibiyo match to pursue his dream. But that doesn’t go to plan as his father defeats him and in the match and he leaves the village thinking it’s better to quit.
Damaru ko Dandibiyo is directed by Chhetan Gurung–this is his debut movie. Both the writer (Lamichhane) and the director have done a stellar job in showing the audience what ‘the lost sport’ is about. The strong script keeps the audience engaged and the tone in which the movie is shot compliments the script.
The first half of the film teaches the audience about dandibiyo and its rules. The second half was equally good and engaging as all those present in the hall wanted to know if Damaru would revive the sport or not.
All the actors have given stellar performances. Lamichhane, in the lead role, comes out with his best. His natural acting throughout the film makes him stand out from the rest of the cast.

Along with Lamichhane, Anup Baral who plays the role of Damaru’s father is equally good. His seriousness in the first half of the film is worth admiring as well as his role as coach in the second half.
Menuka Pradhan gives a powerful performance as Mala. She was particularly good in the emotional scenes where the rest of the cast were a bit weak. But the lack of chemistry between her and Lamichhane was visible. Supporting actor Buddhi Tamang is his natural self and has given another decent performance along with Ashant Sharma and Laxmi Bardewa who have done justice to their respective roles.
The background scores and the music in the film are good and they do not feel out of place. The cinematography is simple as the cinematographer has captured all scenes well, especially the dandibiyo matches that take place in the second half.
To sum it up, the movie is a worth a watch. It’s quite disheartening that more movies like these aren’t being made. The movie informs the audience about the country’s de facto national sport. Maybe this movie will encourage youngsters to take up the sport.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kohalpur-express-movie-review-a-cheap-copy-of-mumbai-express.html,"
A recent trend in the Nepali film industry: rope in a group of well-known actors and give them funny roles to play. The reason: people will come watch the movie no matter how boring it may be. Kohalpur Express–I’m not surprised–does not buck the trend, even at the cost of creativity and presentation.
The story begins with SP (Buddhi Tamang), Krishna (Binod Neupane) and Salo Keto planning to kidnap (Rabindra Jha) Agrawal’s son. The mastermind behind this kidnapping is an expecting mother Champa (Priyanka Karki) who wants to have a happy life. She believes that looting a rich and corrupt man is the only way to do it without trampling on her ‘morals’.
But the story takes a turn when kidnappers SP, Krishna and Salo Keto get injured and Kohalpur Express (Keki Adhikari) has to kidnap the kid. However, all goes horribly wrong after she not only picks up the wrong kid, but also loses the ransom money.
Initially, you think the movie is quite nice. But when you realise the movie is an adaptation of the Kamal Hassan-starer Mumbai Express, the movie loses its appeal. Apart from a handful of sequences and dialogues, the movie offers nothing different. It revolves around the same narrative Nepali films normally play around money.
Keki Adhikari, also the producer of the film, has done a decent job as she plays the role of a woman who has difficulty hearing–she can do no wrong. But that said, she has no proper emotions in the movie and is always serious.
Karki is good as usual but her role of an angry pregnant woman is not as good it could have done. At times you wonder: Why is she is always mad? But her chemistry with Tamang does look genuine, unlike her ridiculously large belly.
Tamang doesn’t have a huge role but he makes you laugh with his usual witty dialogues. He is slowly becoming the Brahmanandam Kanneganti of Nepali movies.
Reecha Sharma is just odd. Her role of Agrawal’s second wife is awkward and she is too loud most of the times and overdoes things with her expressions.
The other actors are bearable. Child actor Kushagra Bhattarai gives a good performance but needs to work on his emotions in the future. Neupane, in a different role, has done quite well and pulled off the role of a stammerer with grace.

The script and screenplay are more than just an adaptation of Mumbai Express, so there’s not a lot one can talk about them. The positive aspect of the movie is that the writer has keeps the suspense under the wraps pretty effectively. The cinematography is quite good like all movies being made these days.
The music is not so great. The song ‘C-O-W Cow’ has received over 8 million views on YouTube. All other songs in the film are a just there to prolong the runtime.
The background score given by Rohit Shakya is good, especially the title song.

Multiplexes in Kathmandu are screening yet another romantic movie this week, the much-awaited Lily Bily. The movie starring popular actor Pradeep Khadka and debutante Jasita Gurung has been directed by Milan Chams.
This ‘rom-com’ revolves around the story of two characters Avash (Pradeep Khadka) and Shruti(Jasita Guring) who meet at a restroom at a cinema hall in Scotland. Both come from different family backgrounds–with their own baggage of emotions. During an unusual and interesting journey, they start to look for their soul mate inside one another before falling in love. But the story takes a turn when they find out the truth about one another.
The first half of the movie is avoidable and lacks substance and good writing. The start is abrupt as the movie loses the audience in the first half itself. The dialogues are clichéd and the sound is poorly dubbed.
The first half ends on a cliffhanger–it is the only reason people stick around to watch the movie. The story in the second half gets better, but again clichéd dialogues and screenplay leaves many in the hall restless and bored.
Pradeep Khadka has tried to do his best in a movie which he should never have signed up for. Rather than playing similar type of movies, he should have tried different roles to showed his versatility. But he had a movie to forget.

Jasita Gurung is below par and had a debut to forget. Her lack of experience in the field was the reason for such a mediocre performance–something the director must have noticed while shooting. All she does in the movie is cry from start to finish and brings nothing new to the table as she gives a flat performance.
Priyanka Karki does her best in a short cameo and the gulf in class and experience between her and Gurung os glaring. Anoop Bikram Shahi can be seen in a negative role again, but again his role was so short that nothing can be made of it.
The reason the actors were bad has to be the story. It plays on the same of narrative that we’ve been watching for decades. The writer of the film hasn’t tried anything different and has been lazy with both the dialogues and the screenplay. The only thing that makes it different is that it’s been shot in a foreign land.
The cinematography could have been better. Most of the film was shot in Scotland, which is an extremely picturesque and they have shown that. But it could have been done by literally anyone. There are times when the shot jump from one place to another without explaining why.
When it comes to romantic movies, at least the songs are good, but it’s not the case when it comes to Llily Bily. The songs aren’t any good and the choreography is just avoidable.
To sum it up, the movie doesn’t leave a good impression. One thing can be learned from the film: Shooting a flick in a foreign location doesn’t make it better. There are a lot of factors that make a movie great and this movie does not have any of it.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/timi-sanga-movie-review-cliched-tale-of-friendship-love-and-sacrifice.html,"The story revolves around three characters, all from different walks of life destined to travel together. Niti (Samragyee RL Shah) is an NRN visiting Nepal for the first time and she meets Shuvam (Aakash Shrestha). He is her guide for her trek to Poon Hill. Bharat Raj Mishra (Najir Husen), an unusual trekker from Terai with his own personal mission, meets Niti and Shuvam on the way. During their journey, they go through unexpected love and emotions with each other.
Beginning of the movie Timi Sanga along with the first half is enjoyable as romantic comedies generally are; but there is a feeling that the director got carried away in the second half and stretched it too long. The actors have done a steady job trying to connect with the audience, but they fail to materialise in the second half of the film. One could sense what was coming because the second half of the movie plays on a similar narrative old Hindi movies used to play with corny dialogues in the forefront of it all.
The actors have done a decent job in the film. Fan favourite Samragyee Shah looks to be in her zone playing the role of an NRN. Acting as the lead in her third film, she has come a long way since her debut movie Dreams. Her attitude stands out in the film along with her acting in some of the emotional scenes.
Najir Hussain like always is brilliant with his witty acting and powerful dialogue delivery. One can’t help but feel that without him and his constant jokes, the movie would have been difficult to watch.

Acting in his second film, Aakash Shrestha also looks in his zone as his chemistry with Shah stands out. But there are times his inexperience shows especially during some emotional scenes. That said he also needs to dance better if he wasn’t to be a versatile actor.
The actors, however, have been let down by a poor script. The storyline has been thought of well but the dialogues are not as good. Some are witty and makes you laugh but most are frail and uninspired.
The film is over two hours long thanks to a number of songs, most of which are futile and drag the movie making the audience restless. The song ‘Man Ma Ago’ was needless and maybe would have been popular a few decades ago. Romantic movies do need songs but apart from ‘Ladyo Ladyo’. The rest of them are below average along with the background scores.
The cinematography is good given it was shot in such picturesque destination around the Annapurnas. However, they have done nothing new in the film and one can notice ‘grains’ during some night shots which makes it clear that the director didn’t give enough attention to details. Along with that, dubbing is equally bad as the audio isn’t in sync with the visuals.
Influenced by romantic Bollywood films, the movie isn’t a bad watch. The story is good and is engaging thanks to some fine acting by the cast. But with better planning and a shorter script, it could have been much better.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/high-energy-consumption-should-not-be-discouraged-now-ghising.html,"NEA Managing Director Kulman Ghising
Nepal Electricity Authority’s Managing Director Kul Man Ghising is retiring in a few months. When he was promoted to the position in 2016, the country was in a severe power crisis. Nepalis had to endure up to 18 hours of load-shedding every day. However, the regular power outage is a once-upon-a-time story now. Rather, Ghising’s team in the authority is currently advocating for increased energy consumption in Nepal, claiming the country will see more hydropower projects in the next few years.
Onlinekhabar’s Rabindra Ghimire recently talked to Ghising about why he is promoting energy consumption though the country still imports electricity from India.
Excerpts:
Media reports claim that the NEA is in a comfortable position regarding the balance between energy demand and supply. Are you really confident about the company’s capacity to meet the demand?
Let me clarify the confusion first. Some media reports have said that demand is on a steady decline, but it is not true. Every year, the demand falls in October and November, mainly due to two reasons. The first: this period is one of transition–there is not much heat in the southern plains, neither there’s too much cold in the mountains. That’s why consumers don’t operate appliances such as heaters and fans that require heavy load. Besides, there are many festivals such as Dashain, Tihar, Chhath and Bishwakarma Puja. Factories close their operations for such festivals and demand significantly dips.
This is the usual trend. But definitely demand has slightly increased this time, so has the availability of power. The peak demand has not increased above 1,300 megawatt, which is good. Likewise, to maintain balance, many projects are underway to enhance energy efficiency whereas we have run a successful programme to control pilferage.
Daily load management is difficult because the demand amount differs every hour. Currently, our power generation capacity is around 1,200 megawatts, at least during the five months of the monsoon. This year, we also exported around 200-megawatt energy to Bihar because the generation exceeded the demand.
In the monsoon season, we do not need to import energy. Now, the monsoon is over most of our run-of-the-river projects are generating power below par. Hence, we are importing energy for peak hours. However, it is very nominal in comparison to the past. Till April-May next year, the import amount will increase as our production capacity continues decreasing–this has been the trend for every dry season. Despite that, we estimate that the amount of imported power will be less than that of last year.
On the other hand, we are completing some new transmission lines so that we can import power whenever we wish. They will also enable us to enter the Indian energy market for trading. We hope to produce an additional 1,000-megawatt energy by June-July the next year. It means we have to export at least 500 to 600-megawatt power in the monsoon. We are discussing how we can become more efficient in the Indian market next monsoon.
In the winter season, however, we do not have that flexibility. Nonetheless, we have to increase consumption in the domestic market. It means we have to increase the capacity of our distribution systems, substations, transmission lines. We also need to expand the scope of power consumption, for example to cooking. We are studying all these issues.
We believe that a certain volume of energy, at least 15 to 20 per cent of the demand, should remain on reserve. We are planning to convert the Indian grid as the reserve margin for us when Nepal is self-reliant to meet the demand. Likewise, our export to India can be a reserve margin for them.
NEA Managing Director Kul Man Ghising
Do you think replacing cooking gas is possible immediately?
Yes, it is possible. Of course, we are still importing energy during the dry season. But, we are also selling it during the monsoon, at a competitive price. If importing helps us improve our economy, we should not consider it negatively.
The government should introduce a demand stimulation plan. It will address the need for increasing domestic demand and adjusting the tariff structure. The current tariff structure discourages high consumption, but it should not be discouraged now.
However, we are clear that we should not change the tariff for the families which use the least amount of electricity every month–power is a lifeline for them. There are more than 1.2 million customers who pay Rs 3 for one unit of electricity. But at the next level, for the middle-class and upper-class people, the amount of consumption and the tariff rate should be inversely proportional–the more they consume, the lower the rate they are charged.
Likewise, we are thinking of using smart metres, which calculate different rates for different times of a day, for example, power goes quite expensive during peak hours. Such technology also helps us maintain balance. We can also calculate the tariff differently for different seasons, for example, it should be cheap in the monsoon.
You are thinking of imposing a higher rate for the customers who use less energy. But recently, a report has claimed Nepal’s electricity is the most expensive in South Asia already. 
I don’t accept that our energy is the most expensive in South Asia. You cannot compare us with Bhutan because it has so much surplus amount and has earned a lot by exporting energy to India. Consequently, people get power at subsidised rates. I don’t think you can compare Nepal with Bangladesh also because it also has so many subsidised schemes. India has different rates for different districts; but, overall, the rate is higher.
Our energy is not expensive. The current tariff is not benefitting us; it is just enough to maintain a breakeven. The amount that we earned in profit recently comes from other sources like interests paid by the projects of our investments. The tariff does not contribute to our profit.
Apparently, we should sell it at a higher rate than our purchase. Our average cost price is Rs 7.5 per unit, but we are selling it for Rs 3 to 5, not only for the lower-class domestic consumers.  Industrial enterprises are using power for Rs 4.15 per unit during nighttime. On average, a factory in Birgunj pays Rs 7.64 per unit; we buy it from Bihar at the rate of Rs 10 whereas domestic hydropower projects have different rates, as much as Rs 15.
Do you think the authority is ready for some subsidy schemes like in other countries if the government wants?
Rather than subsidies, we are working for a scientific tariff that will increase our demand, meet our revenue target and make the energy cheaper in the long run. We have a plan for that.
You said the current tariff is already enough to maintain a breakeven for the company. So why are you looking for increasing the revenue target? As a government authority, you are not supposed to earn any profit.
We have assets worth Rs 400 billion, but we are in debt of Rs 200 billion. We have to pay for its interest regularly. Also, look at our long-term liability. We have around 12,000 staff; of them, around 6,000 are entitled to the pension for the entire life.
If the authority is stronger, it can invest in other projects. It can build new hydro projects. There are costs involved in the maintenance of substations and other infrastructures. I agree that we should not look for any big profit like a private company, but we need profit at a certain level so that we can also catch any reinvestment opportunities.
We are not distributing our profit to the staff; we are investing it for people. If we had earned a profit of Rs 20 billion, the authority could have built the Budhi Gandaki project on its own. That would have been another benefit for the country and its people.
When the authority grows self-sustained, the government can channelise its money that it earlier used to give to the authority to other sectors like education, health, and roads.",/interview,"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 07:06:02 +0000"

Broughton Coburn of Wilson, Wyoming has worked in conservation and development projects in Nepal, Tibet and India for the four decades, for a variety of international agencies. In Nepal, he worked for the establishment of the Annapurna Area Conservation Project (ACAP), which attracts thousands of tourists, domestic and foreign, every year.
Ahead of the government’s ambitious Visit Nepal Year 2020, Coburn recently spoke to  Onlinkhabar about his time in ACAP and how conservation areas in Nepal are facing an uncertain future.
Excerpts:
How did you get into ACAP?
I came to Nepal as a Peace Corps volunteer and was posted in Syangja, where I lived with an elderly Gurung woman, and wrote two books about her life.  Then I got the chance to work with the Agriculture Department’s Division of Soil Science on a USAID-funded project in which we explored the potential for biogas (gobar gas). I played a small role in that, but am proud to say that there are nearly 200,000 operating, self-sustaining gobar gas plants in Nepal, now. I also worked with UNESCO in Sagarmatha National Park.
What were your first works in conservation?
I became associated with King Mahendra’s Trust for Nature Conservation (later renamed the National Trust for Nature Conservation), and ACAP was one of their lead projects. This ambitious effort resulted in Nepal’s first “conservation areas”, and was gazetted in 1988.  Again, I played a small role, and need to give a big shout out to Dr. Hemanta Raj Mishra, Dr. Chandra Prasad Gurung, and Dr. Mingma Norbu Sherpa. Chandra and Mingma and I toured the Annapurna region, gathering information and speaking with villagers and village leaders. We then started looking at various development plans and objectives. Tragically, Chandra and Mingma were killed in the devastating helicopter crash in the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area a number of years ago.
Looking at it now, aren’t you disappointed that it doesn’t run with the same values as it did back then?
I would say that as ACAP has grown, it has become a bit bureaucratic, and is not operating at the same level of motivation and energy it once had.  But this can happen as any organization grows and matures, and eventually ages.  Perhaps it is time to re-design or re-configure it, to address the changing economic and environmental situations in Nepal — and breathe new life into it?
What are the major challenges for an organisation like these?
Well, the major challenges I see concern growth and development. I believe growth is outpacing ACAP and other conservation areas’ abilities to manage the resources in a sustainable manner. More specifically, the Act and regulations underpinning ACAP expire on January 17, 2020.  I’m not sure that ACAP staff are entirely certain what will happen next. But with careful planning they can hopefully re-configure an ACAP that will re-engage conservation productively and strive to achieve the project’s original goals.

Is the area too big? Can it not be broken down so works can be done more effectively?
I personally feel that ACAP might be too big, and that it has potential for being redefined and restructured. Maybe we were too ambitious in the 1980s in drawing such large boundaries. I wonder if some of the villages along ACAP’s southern border areas would necessarily need to be included a slimmed-down, re-designed protected area, one that focuses more on core management zones that are enduring the heaviest impact from tourism and development.  But there are likely political considerations involved, and this adjustment may be difficult to propose. Especially in Dr. Chandra’s and Dr. Mingma’s absence, and in the spirit of their tireless work, I have offered to help ACAP in whatever limited way I can with the future design process. I see great potential for re-formulating an exciting new ACAP.
Is money also a problem? No one wants to give up on it.
Well, that is one of the problems. No one wants to give up the ACAP royalty revenue stream, so there are likely to be some political tussles with that.
What about the roads? Are they affecting the conservation areas?
It’s discouraging that ACAP (and MCAP, where I was recently) do not have the power to enforce the commissioning of environmental impact assessments for the roads that are penetrating even the most remote corners. From what I’ve gathered, those who propose EIAs, or raise questions about road approval and alignment, are regarded as anti-development. ACAP gets this accusation whenever they raise questions. Conducting the EIA and enforcing the recommendations is part of their mission, along with overseeing and monitoring the environmental standards of the roads that are coming into ACAP and MCAP.
Trekkers complain that the motor road has killed the trails. Do you feel so?
Along some sections of the “alternate” trek routes — the trails that typically bypass the road or travel on the opposite bank of the river — trekking can be tricky or dangerous. Himalayan rivers are prone to landslides, and if slides take out a road, every effort will be made to clear it.  But typically trail maintenance budgets are inadequate to clear large landslides that don’t impact a motor road. After some years, the alternate trekking routes may become unpassableas where they encounter deep landslide scars.
Your thoughts on conservation area projects in general?
I recently visited the Manaslu Conservation Area (MCAP).  As someone involved in the early stages of ACAP, I was disappointed to see virtually no rangers patrolling in the higher elevation areas, and lack of management is evident. If there is an intention to follow the mission of providing for sustainable development, alongside the goal of preserving the environment, I feel there will need to be more attention applied to the environmental and conservation side of the equation.
Why do you think that’s the case? These places get thousands of tourists every year who pay a lot to get in. Yet the area is polluted and the trails are bad. Have they been following conservation ethics?
These questions should be posed to the NTNC, ACAP and MCAP.  They have established the Conservation Area Management Committees (CAMCs), which are doing a good job in many areas, and they have received support from the Hariyo Ban Project, but in some areas environmental protection efforts have been inadequate.
I sense that they’re interested largely in the revenue that tourists bring in. Our group of nine people recently paid $1,900 in permit fees to the NTNC.  I would like to ask where the money goes and how it is used.
Could you share some incidents that you saw there, in MCAP?
I saw an employee working for a new lodge above Samdo run down to the river with a bag of garbage — plastic bottles, tin cans, papers — and dump it all directly into the river, sending it downstream. I had a talk with the lodge manager, who said that “it’s just the way it is.”
And near Bimthang (ACAP side of the Larkya La), I saw uncontrolled goat and sheep grazing. Arguably, goats, which are very destructive, don’t belong in a pristine, bio-diverse protected area. The farmer told me that he doesn’t pay any fee to ACAP, and that there is no restriction on goat grazing.  In landslide-prone areas, small livestock can also trigger landslides, and our group had to dodge falling rocks triggered by grazing goats.
By the way, what brings you back to Nepal?
Every other year or so, I return to visit the Manaslu Conservation Area Project, partly because we have an adopted son who is from the area, so I am keen to follow the socio-economic changes and developments, and to observe livestock management and agricultural techniques.  Of course, the advent of a motor road into the area will have a transformative effect on the valley.",/interview,"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 04:45:06 +0000"

Paras Khadka, who stepped down as captain of the national cricket team, is not playing the series against MCC. However, Khadka, who is preparing to go to Dubai to play the T-10 league, is ever-present at the TU Cricket Ground to cheer up his teammates.
On Wednesday, Onlinekhabar’s Raj Kumar Shrestha caught up with Khadka and spoke to him about why he didn’t play this series, his aspiration in the T-10 league and his future plans. Excerpts:
The team you’ve captained for a decade is playing right now but you’re not a part of it. How does it feel to watch the team from the stands? 
When I resigned I had said that I wanted a break from international cricket. That is why I’m not playing. But as a player, it doesn’t feel great to not be playing. If you talk to any player, they will tell you that they want to be playing. When you play, the feeling is different from that when you are on the sidelines. But I’m enjoying watching our boys play in whites. It’s been a while since Nepal played three-day cricket, which in itself is good for us going forward.
Don’t you think the team needs you during this transition phase? Why aren’t you playing? 
I’d asked the management to not put my name in the T-20 and three-day squad. However, I did want to play in the 50-over match. Sadly, due to health reasons, I could not play in that one.
So you’re disappointed no to play?
I wouldn’t say disappointed. It’s just part of a cricketer’s life, to be honest. You’ll obviously miss some games in your career. As I missed out, someone else has got a chance to play for Nepal so I wouldn’t stay I am disappointed.
After this, you’re going to Dubai to play the T-10 league. Is it a coincidence that you were selected to take part in the league after you resigned as captain? 
Well, you have to call it a coincidence. I think I received an offer to play the T-10 league five days after I resigned as captain. When the approach was first made, I was quite unsure. I consulted with family, friends, and coaches who told me that it’s a great opportunity and that I should go play.
I had decided to take a break from cricket as a whole, but coaches told me that this was too big an opportunity to miss out on. It’s funny that I left one thing and got something back in return. But as I said, this is just a coincidence.
I’m looking forward to it as well. I want to play and prove to the team that I can do well in the competition. I will be representing Nepal in the league and if I do will it can open doors for other cricketers as well.
Personally, what is your view on T-10 league? 
Well, this is new to me. As a player, you want to play in these global franchise leagues. I’ve got an opportunity and I feel lucky to have got it. It’s a different format and I’m excited. I hope I can justify my team buying me. But that said, I think I’ll play the way that I always play – giving 100 per cent. It’s a good opportunity and I hope more Nepali cricketers will get this opportunity.
Is this the beginning of Paras Khadka’s international franchise career? 
As it’s the first time I’ll be playing international franchise cricket, you can call it the beginning.

Are you hopeful that this will open the door to popular T-20 leagues like IPL, BBL CPL?
That will depend on my performance. I know Nepali cricket fans want players like me to play in these league but it depends on my performances. If you do well, international cricket will recognise you. Which is why my aim is to play good cricket.
Some have been saying that these franchise leagues were not your priority when you were captain. Is that true? 
I feel playing international T-20 leagues like IPL, CPL, and BBL is every cricketer’s dream. Me being captain does not affect that dream I think. But I will say that as a captain you have to think about a lot of things. I’ve tried my best to do what is good for Nepali cricket. Some decisions that I’ve made have been correct and similarly, I have also made some bad decisions.
What feel is right now I can just concentrate on playing cricket and playing well. I have nothing else to worry about and I guess that is going to be fun. Cricket is something that will stay with me for life. I will not be able to go away from it. The best thing for me is the ball hitting the middle of my bat. I want to play cricket. I have no other agenda right now. But I do feel a bit relieved as I am no longer the captain.
Had you wished to be part of the IPL or other leagues for that matter? 
I’d say yes. But if you ask this to any cricketer they will say yes. I wouldn’t just say IPL. No cricketer would say no if you asked him to play in a franchise league. What I feel sad about is we have only been able to play one world cup. We have failed to qualify for the ODI World Cup and have missed out on 2/3 T-20 World Cups. Had we played in these tournaments, we would have had more exposure. I guess it would have opened the door for more competitions. That said, I do feel we can play in these tournaments in the future. I think we are more than capable. But for that, all of us need to come together.
Do you think your performances in Singapore was the reason for your selection in the T-10 league? 
Maybe. Because in cricket they say one catch can change a match and one innings can change a career. Maybe that 100 in Singapore is that innings for me.
Are you talking to Pakistan Super League and other leagues as well? 
I’ve sent my name for the PSL draft. But I don’t know if I’ll be selected. Let’s see what happens. People were asking me if I will play in the Emerging Nations or the T-10. I do feel the country should always come first, but I had already committed to play the T-10 league. I asked our coach Umesh Patwal if it was fine with me playing in the T-10 league and he told me to go. He told me that young players will be given a change instead of me which is why I decided to go to Dubai. But in the future, if the choice is between country and franchise team, I’ll always choose the country.
As you said, one inning can change a player’s career. Can we expect such an inning during the T-10 league? 
I cannot guarantee anything like that. But that said, I will try. In this sport, as you play along you get to create records. For me what’s important is that the team wins.",/interview,"Thu, 07 Nov 2019 09:57:18 +0000"

Anjal Niraula is a distributed solar expert. He is also a member of the Future Energy Leader’s group with the World Energy Council where he works on the Energy Access taskforce. As CEO of Gham Power, one of Nepal’s leading solar companies, he oversees R&D and product strategy, including business development, design, and engineering. He has been with Gham Power since it’s early days in 2010, when Nepal faced a severe power crisis with outages up to 18 hrs a day. Gham Power, which was first established to provide back-up for households during the crisis, now develops solar microgrids in rural areas and in urban areas it is developing itself as an energy service company. Onlinekhabar’s Abhaya Raj Joshi talked to Niraula recently on his company’s work and the way forward for solar power in Nepal, Excerpts:
Let’s start the interview talking about some global issues. The Chinese government recently made some policy changes to slash financial aid to developers after Chinese companies overshot targets. How has this affected your business? In Nepal, most of the PVs are imported from China.
As we all know is the world’s major solar PV producer and the demand and supply in the Chinese market affect markets worldwide, including that in Nepal. The policy change comes at an important time. There was a time when solar power cost around 50-60 cent per watt. But after the Chinese policy change, it dropped to 20-30 cents per watt. Before the price drop, solar was considered as an alternative source of power because of its price. But now we are past the price point where solar power can compete with other power sources. Thanks to the drop in prices, Gham Power can now offer power to its customers at a rate cheaper than that of the government grid. So if we look at the cost involved, it has hit the right price point for us to develop ourselves as an energy service company.
If the policy change had not come, what would have happened?  
Solar PV prices have been falling for a long time and any other trigger would have also done the job. But the Chinese policy made it quicker. I believe that it would have eventually happened. When we started our business, people were using diesel generators as back up for power because the state utility could not supply reliable power. Back then also, solar power asaback-up was cheaper compared to diesel. But it was not considered a mainstream source of power. That is why we chose to go to places where access to grid power was limited to geographical reasons. We built micro-grids in areas where bringing grip power was costlier than setting up solar plants. But with the drop in prices and the restored stability in the grid, the commercial market soon began to look feasible for us.
One big criticism labeled against solar power is that it is not reliable. It depends on the amount of sunshine available.
This is the case with all the renewable energy sources. The amount of solar radiation and wind available to us is not under our control. Same is the case with hydro. The power output is directly related with the water available during different seasons. I think the bigger question most certainly is — how you devise strategies to integrate these intermittent energy sources into the grid which also has a variable demand. Digitisation and storage technology could play a bigger role there.
In the past, Nepal Electricity Authority was considered the sole provider of electricity in the country. But these days, companies such as Gham Power are also providing electricity. How does that work?
Until now, we have developed around 2-3 projects under the model we developed to provide cheaper power (compared to the grid) in urban areas. This model is a bit investment-intensive. We need to seek investors to put their money on such projects. This is a problem we’ll talk about later on.
But what we do is make the model feasible for the customer. We talk to potential clients, look at their roof space, their electricity bill, load profile and calculate the potential power that can be generated using solar PVs. At the moment, we only talk about offsetting the consumers’ dependence on grid electricity by using solar power. When the client signs up with us, they don’t need to pay anything for the solar plant; they pay a certain fee per unit of electricity they receive from our solar plant and after 15 years they get to own the entire system. They no longer have to pay us. As the system works for around 25-30 years, the customers get free power for around 15 years.
We are bearing all the risk and the cost associated with the project that’s why we are keen only on at least 50-100 KW projects. The downside is that if the grid becomes unstable again, we have to think about storage. But what we do is we design the installed capacity of our system to be lower than the actual consumption, so that we don’t have to sell excess power to the grid.
We talked about the fall in PV prices, but what about the batteries? Is that why your project model focuses on day-time offsetting rather than night? 
To some extent yes. If you look at our nation’s peak demand, it occurs during the evening when solar production is not at it’s maximum. So, you eventually have to look at storage as an important part of integrating solar into the grid. But, in Nepal, the battery is still expensive. The tax incentives are still not there so just from an economic standpoint it might not make sense right not if you were to invest in batteries alone.
But, on a positive note, if you look at the international market, the price of batteries is also falling. There is great R&D work being done all over the world and we expect it to drop much more. In the very near future, I fully expect batteries to become a part of our grid and they would help provide much needed stability to the grid.
There was a time when the price of the PV was so high that it did not make economic sense to talk about it in a country where hydro has been the most popular source of energy. But now that the prices have fallen, what are some of the challenges you face in developing solar power projects?
That’s true. A few years ago, when the solar prices were high it was viewed more as an “alternative” source of energy. Either to provide power to remote communities, to have a reliable back-up during loadshedding or to displace diesel. Now when you talk about solar, you can actually start to talk about it in purely economic terms, because it can easily be cheaper than the grid and help you reduce your energy costs. But, for solar to really take off there are multiple challenges especially regulatory that need to be addressed.
First, it seems that government policy and laws related to energy, are framed with only hydropower in mind. Almost all the documentation that you need to submit to the authorities are hydro-related. For example, the EIA requirements of a hydropower plant and a solar plant are inherently different, but they need to have a similar structure. There is no consideration given for distributed solar which can be built on rooftops. So, the legalities around how approvals can be obtained for such projects are a bit vague.
Is finance a problem for companies like Ghampower? 
Yes, it is. Financing solar power projects from a local bank still requires personal guarantees from project promoters despite which this can still be quite a lengthy process.  In this case, companies like Ghampower which do not have the funds to perpetually bank-roll these projects struggle to develop a large portfolio..
The other issue with finance is that foreign direct investment proposals take at least 6-9 months to receive government approval. The threshold of foreign investment has been raised to 5 crore per tranche, which can be hard to obtain for a nascent market. Raising debt into SME’s from commercial foreign investors has also been barred. So, there have been instances where we have had to ask our sales team to actually reduce the size of project that we execute. For example – there was one instance where our client was intent on installing 500 kW of solar, but we had to reduce the size of the project to 200 kW.
Despite the tremendous potential the market holds, these policy bottlenecks have really slowed our path to scale. But, I am very hopeful that with the recently suggested amendments to the Electricity Act and the Foreign Investment Act will allow us to tap into this huge market and deploy cheap, reliable solar power at scale.
How does solar compete with hydro these days?
The beauty of solar is that it is very demand-driven. If you need 10 kw you set-up a 10 kw plant. The installation time is minimal and you can set it up on your roof, however much you need it. And guess what, it can be cheaper than what you are paying for the grid electricity.
Hydropower is definitely going to be the mainstay of energy generation in Nepal for the foreseeable future, and the fact that the National grid is so reliable has actually allowed us to set up these grid connected solar systems. So, in our case solar and hydro are not competing but are complementary to each other.
Distributed solar can help reduce the burden on the distribution infrastructure and bring massive monetary savings in terms of reduced losses and reduction in investment cost towards upgrading of the distribution infrastructure. With the increased electricity consumption planned through Electric vehicles and clean cooking, distributed solar will have a big role to play in allowing the utility to manage this demand. Digitisation is key in managing these distributed systems and creating a more robust grid in the country.
What is your take on the future of the energy market globally?
It’s going to be decentralised, it’s going to renewable and it will be digital. Storage and infrastructure will remain the key.
And for Nepal?
I see solar massive potential. Within a few years solar PVs will be a common sight on all houses in Kathmandu. What we need to do is get all the stakeholders together and focus on building the right policies for the future.

Wolfgang Nairz is a renowned mountaineer and the leader of Austria’s 1978 Everest expedition, in which Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler reached the top of Everest without bottled oxygen.
Nairz first came to Nepal in 1970 and since then has been coming to Nepal on a regular basis. Last week, Nairz arrived in Nepal for the 100th time, becoming probably the first foreigner to do so. Upon arrival, his hosts and fans gave him a ‘hero’s welcome’ at the Kathmandu airport and took him to Thamel on a traditional carriage (baggi). Later, Nairz spoke to Onlinekhabar about his impression of Nepal, how things have changed here and about his projects in the country. Excerpts: 
How does it feel to come to Nepal for the 100th time? 
It doesn’t feel any different actually. It feels like coming back home. It has nearly been 50 years since I came to Nepal for the first time, but the joy I get coming to this country is the same. Initially, I was interested in the mountains, but now I also come for the culture and the people. We have a lot of projects here.
What brings you back every time? 
Well, it has to be people. Over the past 50 years, I’ve met a lot of good people. Along with the people, I’d also say the landscape and the culture and religion. I’d say a harmony between the three.
You came to Thamel riding on a carriage all the way from the airport. How was that feeling?
Incredible. I have some great friends here who have given me a terrific reception on my 100th visit to Nepal. They had told me they were not there, but then everyone was at the airport. It was a great surprise, the one I will never forget. The streets were clean, flowers everywhere. It’s like they had done it not for the Chinese President, but for me.
Nairz riding towards Marsyandi Hotel in Thamel on a carriage arranged for him by his friends.
How have things changed since you first came to now?
A lot has changed. I don’t think you can even imagine how things were during those times. There were only three or four big hotels; others were only small guest houses. We rode only bicycles as there were hardly any cars on the roads. We used to go to Bouddha, Patan and other areas on our bicycles. It was really a different time.
Kathmandu has changed the most. It was much calmer. Now it’s a bit wild. I remember we had to carry our own bags off the plane before going to the immigration office. I’d say the change in Kathmandu is negative. However, the changes in the remote areas have been positive. I think that is all thanks to tourism. It’s helped develop areas like Namche into something better.
How would you describe your Everest expedition in 1978?
I’d say it was difficult. Things are a lot easy now. Back then we had to do a lot of work. When I reached the top of Everest, only 60 climbers had reached the top so you could imagine how tough it was. But we had a good team which had Reinhold Messner among others and I think we did a fairly good job. We had no icefall doctors so we had to fix ropes and also prepare camps. It was not as easy as people have it now. We also did not have communication with the outside world. Any source of communication had to come through Kathmandu first, then fly to Lukla and then to base camp.
Was there pressure to summit Everest? 
There wasn’t actually. We were quite calm. Yes, we did have our fair share of luck thanks to the good weather, but we were good climbers. We knew we had it in us to get to the top of the world’s highest peak. Our Sherpas were quite good too.
What other mountains have you climbed here? 
I’ve been to seven 8,000-metre peaks here in Nepal and led the expedition in all of them. I’ve climbed Manaslu South Face in 1972, which was my first, then Makalu South Face in 1974, Everest in 1978, Ama Dablam in 1979 where we rescued Sir Edmund Hillary’s son. I also summited Dhaulagiri, Cho Oyu South Face.
What have these mountains taught you? 
Well the one lesson that the mountains have given me is that there’s always the next time. It’s taught me that coming back down is as important as going up. I lost a friend during the Dhaulagiri expedition which still hurts me. It’s taught me that every mountain is different and each should be respected individually.
What do you do when you come to Nepal every year? 
The first thing I do is meeting my friends. After that, I go to monitor various projects which I’m funding. We’ve been doing a lot of charity work here, especially after the 2015 earthquake. We’re working on the Hillary Hospital to which my and Messner’s foundation has donated around $400,000. We’re working with Tashi Tenzing and Green Tara Foundation building schools. I also have a Sherpa Project where I take 25 Nepalis from remote areas to Austria and give them lodge management training.
This is a win-win situation for both the lodge owner in Austria who gets human resources and to Nepalis here who can learn a lot by spending three to four months in Austria. They also get a good salary there.
We’re also building schools here. One in Sindupalchok for around 200 children with Tashi Tenzing. In Chilaune of the district, we’ve built another school. We’re also working on a reforestation project in the Khumbu region. We’ve also help build a few cultural monuments in the region so people can go practice their faith there.
Wolfgang with his wife Edith
How do you raise money for these projects? 
Well, my organisation has over 150 members and we do various fundraising activities. We give lectures, attend various programmes which help us get money. If you look at the things post-earthquake, we’ve nearly spent $700,000 rebuilding schools and hospitals in the remotest parts of Nepal.
So your charity only involves Nepal? 
Yes. Just here.
What about your partners here? 
They have been important to me. Sonam Sherpa, Tsering Lama, Tashi Tenzing, Ang Rita all have been great. I can trust these people wholeheartedly. They know where help is required and through them I can send funds there. I know that the money we’re raising is going to good hands. Corruption is quite high here in Nepal, which is why we need people like them.
How often do you travel around here? 
I travel a lot. How do you think I reach 100? I love to trek around. I’ve been to some really good places. Upper Dolpo, Mustang, Nar Phu… these places aren’t visited by many. I bring friends with me most of the time and we go trekking. This year, we’re going to Langtang.
Do you think tourism has got better here?
I think it has, but there is a lot more we need to do to make sure that Visit Nepal 2020 is a success. They have increased visa fees. They take so much money for permits, but where is the money? People need to ask the government what they’re doing with the money coming in from tourists. It needs to be addressed. The private sector is doing well when it comes to tourism. However, I don’t see the government is doing enough.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/everest-climb-in-autumn-sounds-tough-but-can-be-done-garrett-madison.html,"
Garrett Madison is one of the most sought-after foreign climbers and mountain guides. Since he first summited Everest in 2006, he has led over 60 climbers to the summit of Everest and started his own company, Madison Mountaineering.
Madison holds multiple high-altitude mountaineering world records. He is the only person to have climbed Mount Everest and Lhotse in a day, that too three times. He is also the only American to have climbed K2 twice. Madison spoke to Onlinekhabar about his current expedition where he plans to take a team to the top of Everest in autumn for the first time since 2010 and about mountaineering in Nepal. Excerpts:
How did you go from being a mountain guide to starting your own company? 
I started working as a mountain guide in 1999 when I was 20. It was a summer job to guide people up Mount Rainer. That is how I started. As I loved mountaineering, I joined Alpine Accents International and worked for them until 2014 when I thought why not start my own company. That’s how Madison Mountaineering started. My maiden project was to lead the climb on Everest in 2014 and it’s been a fun but a challenging adventure ever since.
How different was running your own company from working for an expedition company? 
It’s basically the same stuff that I do now. It is just a bit more responsibility on the logistic side. But I have a good team that handles it. So I’d say I’m lucky in that regard.
You recently climbed Everest in the spring season, what made you come back in the autumn? 
I’ve never climbed Everest in autumn. However, I have attempted other 8,000 metre peaks such as Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu in autumn. But I wanted to do Everest too. The main reason is that we’re doing Everest this year because Mountain Hardware, which makes clothing equipment for high altitude climbing wanted to test its new product line. We felt that the best place and time to test it was on Everest in the autumn. We’ll be testing everything from down suits to sleeping bags to tents.
Apart from that, we at Madison Mountaineering wanted to do something unique. As the spring season is overcrowded, we wanted to see if we can market Everest for the autumn. That would help minimise the crowd during the spring. Everest hasn’t been summited in autumn since 2010 and we want to see if we can change that. We have some good climbers on the mountain like Kilian Jornet and Andrzej Bargiel so hopefully, we can work together to reach the top. Our Nepali climbers are just as good and are currently fixing ropes and arranging the base camp so we’re positive about this expedition.
But I am concerned that it’s been raining so much. Rain here means a lot of snow in the mountains and that means there’s a risk of avalanches.
How different do you expect that mountain to be in autumn as compared to spring? 
Well, post-monsoon is different for a variety of reason. Firstly, there’s is a lot of snow up there. Secondly, there are a lot fewer people on the mountain. In spring, there are around a 400-500 people on the mountain, but now there’s going to be around 10-15 max. Autumn is also more winter-like. With winter around the corner days will be shorter and will be windier. The summit weather window will also be shorter. Will be a lot challenging. I’ve done Everest 10 times all in the spring so if we can prove that Everest can be done in the autumn that would be great.
How’s rope fixing going on amidst the rain? 
It’s going on at a slow pace. The weather isn’t good and the Nepali climbers have told me that it’s very cloudy up there. They are one-quarter of the way up the Khumbu icefall. They’re hoping they’ll reach Camp 1 in a week’s time. Our plan is to reach base camp by mid-September and hope by then they’ll be able to reach Camp 2.
Your success rate is quite high. What, according to you, makes a good mountain guide? 
I’d say lots of experience and willingness to learn from mistakes and surrounding yourself with good people. You’ll also need some natural ability and some physical fitness to function well in the death zones. Apart from that we also need proper mountain training and techniques. It’s a combination of knowledge and skill I would say.
Madison on the summit of Everest.
People often say that climbing in Europe and the Americas is different from climbing in the Himalayas. How true is that? 
It’s very true.  In America and the Alps, it’s more like one-day climbs. You start from a mountain hut and climb for one day and your back. You’re just out for a day or maybe half a day. But here you’re up for two weeks. It’s a real expedition here. Have to carry a lot of stuff to be self-sufficient like medical kits, food and a lot more. There is also no quick evacuation. In the Alps, you get a helicopter rescue at any point, but you don’t get that luxury here in the Himalayas.
What do you feel is the toughest part of being a mountaineer?
I guess it’s the sacrifices you have to make. Spending all this time away from family and loved ones isn’t easy. It’s not like a normal job where you leave home and come back in the evening every day. I’m out for two-three months at a time, and spend around 10 months on the road in a year. So I’d that that is the toughest part.
Do clients appreciate your effort when you take them to the top?
They do. I feel happy when they do. But there are times when I cannot fulfil their expectations and they’re not happy. But I try to tell them that their life is much important that the summit. I don’t like risking people’s lives. My first priority is to make sure everyone comes back safe, this includes the Nepali climbers we have on our team.
Do you enjoy climbing mountains? Here the people from Khumbu climb because they don’t have a choice. They say it’s not fun. Do you have fun? 
Yes, I love climbing. This is my passion. When I was a young man and climbed my first mountain I didn’t want to look back. In the US it’s not a lucrative profession, but I didn’t care about it. Because when you do something you love, you don’t feel like its work. I love the challenge too. Made a lot of memories climbing and will continue to do so.
How satisfied do you get when to take clients up to the summit? 
It’s very satisfying as you’ve helped them reach their goal and also helped changed them in a positive way. What I like is how people get new experiences in a foreign land. They tell me they learn a lot about the country as they spend from a few weeks to a few months depending on where they are. They also make friends and take back more than just a climbing certificate.
What do you love the most about the mountains? 
Just being out there in nature with similar-minded people. We share the same passion and enthusiasm. It’s just the best thing.
When we talk about Everest, we have to talk about the traffic jam picture. For someone who was there, how bad was it? 
Well, it wasn’t as bad as the photograph. It was a busy day but it wasn’t the busiest day I’ve seen on Everest. The reason why it looked so crowded was that there were 200 people queuing up to reach the summit. If you have 100 people going up and another 100 people coming down there is sure to be a traffic jam. That’s when the photo was taken. But the media thinks that it is like that all the time which it’s not. It was maybe one hour, one day, in one year. Feel it was blown out of proportion.
Would you blame the traffic jam for all the deaths? 
I don’t think I would. The lives lost in Everest this year could have been saved with good planning and good managing. There are two types of expeditions on Everest. There is a guided expedition like mine where they hire someone like me and my company to manage logistics and in the long run take them to the summit and also make decisions for them.
And then there is the other type of expedition is when a company just manages the climber’s logistics like permits, oxygen, porters and food. But in these expeditions, the climber makes his own decisions.  The company doesn’t tell them to turn around if they can’t climb. That is when people die. Because when you’re up there you can’t think straight. And if you’re not experienced that can cause a lot more problem.
Those that died this year didn’t have experience climbing such a tough mountain.

Will the government’s plan to make it mandatory to climb a mountain in Nepal before attempting Everest prevent these deaths?
I don’t think it’s a bad idea to try to ensure that Everest climbers are more qualified. However, with this rule, if a climber has climbed K2, he/she would still be ineligible to climb Everest which is wrong in my opinion. It doesn’t make sense to me.
How has mountaineering changed in Nepal since you first came here in 2006?
For starters, there are a lot more people in the sport. I feel the sport has grown for several reason. People want to go to these iconic places like the top of Everest. And now that’s it’s possible for more people, the mountain has seen a lot of people since I first climbed in 2006.
Is the rapid growth in Nepali expedition companies the reason why the number of people climbing Everest as risen significantly? 
These new Nepali companies are simply offering a product that has a demand in the market. The climbers want this product. They want to be able to come and climb Everest at a cheaper price. Some people feel they don’t want a guy like me making decisions on their behalf. They want to make their own decisions. The clients are demanding this service and the companies we see now are just fulfilling their demands.
But is that the reason the mountains are getting inexperienced climbers which causes deaths on these 8000 m peaks?
The business model for Nepali companies is different from mine. I make sure that I have experienced climbers on my team and try to keep my team small up to 12 members. The team has high-level support as we have both high-level mountain guides and experienced Nepali high altitude climbers. Along with that we also have top equipment and ample supply of oxygen. I try to offer and run a good program on the mountain.
But the Nepali companies’ model is different. They believe in volume. They offer a similar programme for a much lower cost. Per person, there is a much smaller profit margin, but if you’re able to bring in numbers, you’re definitely going to make money. So their product is volume-based and it’s not a guided trip. The climber makes his/her own decision. The companies provide just logistics and service to climb the mountain, but there’s no one telling them if it’s safe to go up. Well, they have Nepali high altitude climbers but they can’t tell their clients not to go up and it’s dangerous.
The fatalities are that of climbers who don’t have experience and really want to go to the top of a mountain. The people compare prices and always choose a Nepali company as its half cheaper than companies like mine charge. These people don’t have anyone to ask if it’s worth the risk. Most push themselves which makes it tough on their body and collapse.
What makes you different from these other companies?
My risk tolerance is lower than theirs. They tend to think they can do anything, whereas I feel that I can’t. It’s because I am liable for the safety of my clients which is of paramount importance. I need to take that into consideration before making a risky decision. It a fundamental difference of approach. Some of my clients get really irked when people from other expedition agencies summit and we don’t. It happened this year in K2 when we came back because it was not worth the risk. But one client was not happy that we didn’t summit and other teams did. It is hard to explain to people like him that it’s not worth it. But hey, they pay a lot of money so they are right to think that way I guess.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/daraz-ceo-need-to-localise-if-we-want-to-achieve-success-in-nepal.html,"
Bjarke Mikkelsen is the co-CEO of Daraz Group, a popular online shopping company of the region. He has been with the company for the past four years. Prior to joining Daraz, Mikkelsen worked at Goldman Sachs where he worked as its Executive Director for its branch in London.
Mikkelsen spoke to Onlinekhabar about how his company has changed after being acquired by Alibaba and why localising strategies here in Nepal was important for them to grow as a business. Excerpts:
What has changed since Alibaba acquired Daraz?
Three things have changed mainly. First is the technology. Our value proposition to the customer has improved significantly as we are providing a lot more services. For example, we have started the instant messaging service which allows customers and sellers to communicate with one another in a regulated way. It has opened a world of opportunities. The way we display relevant product to relevant customers at the right time is also a huge improvement we’ve made in recent times.
Number two is the supply change. It has increased substantially as now we are working with sellers around the world and also opening up to Nepali sellers to sell to consumers around the world. This is something we’re working on as a big project with Alibaba to integrate all of their different marketplace platforms. We’re also working on a project which will allow a Nepali seller sign up on Daraz and then automatically be eligible to sell to China or anywhere around the world through one single account.
Number three is just learning. So far, we have been figuring out all on our own, but now that we are affiliated with Alibaba we can do things a lot more efficiently because what we are doing here now, they did it in China years ago.
When can people buy items from Alibaba here in Nepal?
You already can, to some extent. We have a global collection in the app through which you can directly order stuff from China.  Slowly, we will be doing more in that aspect.
Why did 11:11 fail in Nepal as compared to other markets?
In general, that was a new concept here in Nepal and we got to learn a lot from it. Alibaba’s 11:11 is the biggest shopping date worldwide and we wanted to try it here too. From a sales perspective, I don’t think it failed. The sales volume was higher than what we expected. But we had these learnings.
We found after the event the certain customers had to wait longer for the items they had ordered. But considering the order volume that we had, we actually enforced a lot after this campaign. We focused a lot on logistics infrastructure.
Since then, we have also been evaluating the performance of every seller. We do not want our customers to suffer. We sit with them and bring out solutions to make them better.
After 11:11, we also launched a campaign in Nepali New Year, and it was good. We have delivered items in a better manner during that campaign than we do on normal days. Be rest assured, 11:11 will be better this year.
How is Alibaba’s model in South Asia different from that of other countries?
I think it’s a lot more localised. What we’re doing now is trying to understand how the local sellers work and what services do they need. Because the services here may be different from, for example, the services they need in China and Malaysia where everything is digitised and integrated.
It is the same principle which is mainly about being engaged and having something for everyone and using technology to manage a huge marketplace with a lot of sellers and a lot of customers.

Is the app also localised?
It is. The algorithm, mainly, is. We look at what people are searching for and what do they want to see and we try to give them that experience. We also try doing local campaigns which aren’t happening in other countries. We did Nepali New Year earlier this year and now we are doing one for Dashain which starts on September 15.
Have you achieved the breakeven? 
No. Not yet. But we will do that. We plan to be a profitable company by 2022. So far we are still investing in the country. We need to build the infrastructure and we need to have the scale.
Kyamu, when it came to Nepal, advertised on Facebook and Google. That has now changed as you have been advertising in the mainstream media. What brought about this change? 
Advertising, in general, has changed since Kyamu was here and we just evolved with it. The manner in which Nepalis interact with media and the internet has also changed. That way we also learned year on year on what was better for our business. As for our advertising strategy, it didn’t change after we rebranded as Daraz or after Alibaba’s acquisition. When we came here with Kyamu, we came in as a startup, but now we are an established business. In general, our strategy is to stay current and relevant which is why we have been working with more influencers than before.
What inspired Daraz University? How have sellers here taken to it?
It was inspired by Taobao University in China started by Alibaba. When we first started working with Alibaba who had a gigantic university in China we wanted to do something similar to give sellers the knowhow to sell. That was the inspiration. After that, we sat down with a blank piece of paper and started to design a curriculum and we started to do it. That way anyone who has a smartphone can start his/her business.",/interview,"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 08:36:34 +0000"

After reports of a ‘mass suicide’ by monkeys in Chautara of Sindhupalchok district came out, zoologist Dr Mukesh Chalise’s phone was abuzz the entire week. Chalise, the most quoted ‘monkey expert’ in Nepali media, retired from the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University last month. Onlinekhabar recently caught up with Chalise, whose PhD research decades ago focused on the food habits of male and female monkeys.
Excerpts:
Let’s begin the conversation about the ‘mass suicide’ case. You told the media that animals don’t commit suicide or any other crime intentionally. What grounds do you have to support your thesis?
In the course of evolution, the primitive species developed the simplest of nervous systems, which would enable them to feel heat and cold; light and dark. Gradually, other organ systems developed and later specific parts such as nose, ears, and eyes came into being. Then, after thousands of years, mammals came into existence. Humans are mammals whose nervous system has achieved the highest level of development among all the species, and far high enough than lower species.
If you love someone, you can sacrifice your property for them. You can donate the blood flowing inside your body; you can even donate your own organ so that another person can lead a better life. Human beings don’t only have the highest level of benevolence, but also the highest level of selfishness. We can commit heinous crimes such as rape and murder. Suicides are also a result of the highest depression resulted by the influence of genetic characters, religious, social and political situation that impact on human instinct.
Though monkeys are also mammals, they cannot develop such desires because their brain is not fully developed for that. They can make efforts to save themselves and their partners, but they cannot think of killing themselves intentionally. Many animals die falling off cliffs while running to protect themselves from predators, but it should not mean that they commit suicide in fear of predators.
Many people in the Tarai report to me that they have seen many langurs falling off the trees to kill themselves after seeing carnivores, but it is not true. What happens in such cases is that the langurs lose balance after seeing predators and accidentally fall down.
Monkeys have a peculiar interest in investigating things around them, but humans misinterpret it as ‘mischief’. When they find new things, they check if they can eat it; when they go to any new place, they check if they can play there. In 1996, a monkey in Pashupatinath area of Kathmandu touched an unshielded wire; it received an electric shock and cried–without detaching itself from the wire. Another monkey heard the cry and came to save it; it also cried for help. In this way, a total of 41 monkeys died in their efforts to save one monkey. This cannot be considered a mass suicide case because they wanted to save their friend, but that does not mean they wanted to kill themselves.
Like other human societies, Nepali society is also living with animals for ages. But why doesn’t it understand basic things about animals and misinterpret cases like these? Wasn’t it the responsibility of academic institutions like university departments, such as the one you worked for over three decades?
In order to understand why we failed, we need to understand how our education system was developed. If you analyse the historical development of schools in Nepal, you see that our education system always concentrates on meeting the needs of the bureaucracy; this is reflected in both what is taught and how it is taught. It was not concerned with producing experts of certain disciplines or connecting sciences with society. Before the ‘new education system’ (Naya Shiksha) was implemented in the early 1970s, we were required to study ‘civic education’ (Nagarikshastra) and ‘bylaws’ (Ainshastra) in school. They were compulsory subjects, but maths and science were not. We had to learn how to prepare a ‘tamasuk’ (an agreement to facilitate local loan transactions) and how to fold a paper to write a tamasuk.

At the higher level also, the study of science began only in 1959 with the establishment of the Tribhuvan University. Among various disciplines of natural science, many people were attracted to physics because it was comparatively easier and it would not require the students to go beyond the campus. Subjects like zoology came much later, in 1965, because they were more difficult and required practical insights. In the beginning, professors from other countries would visit Tri-Chandra College to teach us. Our university [Tribhuvan University] did not conduct exams on such subjects. If you check the certificates of science professors of that time, you can find they acquired the degrees from foreign institutions including the Patna University of India. Overall, the education system focused on meeting immediate needs, it did not help address practical concerns of common people and uplift the country in the world of sciences.
So, how long did the problem exist? It must have been solved by now. 
No, even our academic programmes just copied courses from Patna University. Even after I joined the university, I remember, we had to struggle to include material related to Nepal’s flora and fauna in the curricula. Intentionally or unintentionally, the professors copied from others, without considering the dignity of their own country.
So far, only around a dozen have completed their PhD in zoology from the Tribhuvan University. I did my PhD in 1995; I was the seventh Nepali zoologist to obtain a PhD and the first in my generation to do so. In the past 24 years since then, only eight persons have done their PhD in this field from the TU. Some went to foreign universities.
Exactly! The number of science students at the high school level has significantly increased. But most of them study medical science or engineering. No one is willing to take up zoology or botany.
Many students, who studied zoology at the master’s level, did not continue their study in the field, but joined the civil service. Former chief secretary Bimal Koirala; and former secretaries Bal Krishna Prasain, Madhu Raman Acharya, BHoj Raj Ghimire, Sushil Ghimire and Mahashram Sharma studied zoology. But they left the discipline after realising that the civil service did not have any position for zoologists. The Public Service Commission calls applications for various positions that require people who have studied accounts, statistics, forestry, geology, or medical science, but not zoology.
Even the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation did not accept us. From its inception, it decided to recruit people who have studied forestry. They though zoologists know about animals, not about the forest. All high position holders of the department are students of forestry. They continued to ignore zoologists.
The zoology department of Tribhuvan University has so far produced around 1,000 zoologists; around 100 have completed their PhD from foreign universities. But still, the Public Service Commission does not recognise the discipline.
Of late, some national and international nongovernment organisations have begun looking for zoologists. Our students have achieved remarkable scientific results in exploration, the discovery of species and impact assessments for developmental projects.
Maybe the commission thought the discipline did not have any importance at the government departments. After all, they are functioning okay even without the zoologists.
No. Zoology is one of the most important scientific disciplines for Nepal. We still proudly claim that we are an agricultural country. Animal rearing is a major branch of Nepali agriculture system, and this is where the farmers can use zoological knowledge. Zoology gives you information about habits and behaviours, life cycles, food systems, reproduction systems and habitats of animals and birds. It means if farmers begin their businesses with the knowledge of zoology, they can reap additional benefits.
If you talk about agriculture-based industries, zoology is equally important. For example, you want to open a modern slaughterhouse. You need zoological knowledge there because veterinarian knowledge is not enough.
Zoology is important for the social sciences as well. You may know that Germans developed the kindergarten system in education after noticing that animals that were separated from their parents early could not socialise well. You can also take the Sindhupalchok case as an example here. After the incident of the deaths of monkeys, locals now need to take additional safety measures to protect their children from drowning. Studying animals has always helped the human society.
If you talk about medical science, if you can extract venom from poisonous snakes like cobra, you can use that to produce anti-venom medicines and save thousands of lives. You might know that the vaccines that are applied to human beings were first tested on animals…

Yes. But, rights activists have always protested the act of using animals to test medicines. Do you think that is ethical?
So do you want to kill human beings in order to save animals? Without causing significant loss to their number, we need to use a few animals to save humanity. Do you wish for the continuous increase in the number of leopards around Kathmandu at the cost of lives of people living there? Or do you think that is ethical?
I am clear that we need to kill animals if they cause harm to humans or other beings. As a human being, I don’t want the destruction of the human race just to increase the number of other species. I continue giving the medicines tested on monkeys to my aged parents who are suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes. If you love monkeys more than your parents, you can abstain from using the medicines. If you want your mother to die in the pain of uterine cancer because you don’t want to carry out a surgery that is tested on an animal first, that is fine. Do you know that cataract surgery started by testing it on monkeys? But if you don’t like it, fine. I don’t argue with you.
But if we develop zoological studies in Nepal, the country can earn millions of dollars every year by selling the medicines. If the country wants to capitalise on its biodiversity, zoological knowledge should be used in medical science. For example, China earns money from every panda of a particular species that is born in any part of the world because the species is originally available in China only. Similarly, macaques (known as red monkeys) that are available in Nepal are ‘purer’ than those in India or China; hence we can experiment medicines of AIDs and tuberculosis on them, and earn millions of rupees in revenues. We should move towards that model. In the name of rights, we should not promote wrong concepts and practices that avoid the value of natural resources. We also should be aware that such experiments affect only very few animals.
Fine, perhaps we can discuss the ethical concerns in another meeting. Now, I want to conclude the conversation on a positive note. Tell us something from the field that is improving.
The zoological study in Nepal has shifted from the traditional approach to the application-centric approach. TU has developed different courses for four branches of zoology; namely: fishery, entomology, parasitology, and ecology. Recently, our students have worked for hydropower projects, urban planning and forest monitoring. Our parasitologists have emerged as professors of medical science. The discipline’s scope has expanded.
Does it mean that Mukesh Chalise will not be the single source for media to talk about any zoological issue now onwards?
Haha… You need to know why I was called and quoted every time. Thanks to my family’s encouragement, I began exploring new places and study about animals living there from my youth. Before Makalu Barun was named a national park, I visited that place and carried out the research. When I submitted my proposal about monkeys to the university for my PhD, many people laughed at me. They said I could have received huge foreign grants if I had chosen elephants, tigers or rhinoceros. I said I did not need money, but knowledge.
Many things are yet to be improved in the discipline in Nepal. The discipline has to be made more practical and connected to daily life. For example, institutes of eastern Nepal should teach their students about parasites and insects affecting the tea cultivation; colleges of western Nepal should teach them about tigers and elephants. They should know why Indian elephants cross the big Mahakali and come to Nepal. The students of the Koshi region need to learn why wild water buffaloes are found in that region of the country only while similar river systems exist in Karnali, Rapti and Narayani regions as well. The students should be taught about pesticides that are applied to vegetables of this region. If that had been the case, our students would have tested pesticide residue on the vegetables imported from India even if the government did not care about it.
This is a global practice and we should follow that. We should thoroughly overhaul the university curricula. Otherwise, the degree you have earned only serves as your prestige label.",/interview,"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 04:18:00 +0000"

With the controversy over a Public Service Commission notice calling applications for 9,000 plus vacancies at the local level, Nepali political leaders and commentators are once again debating the relevance of reservation allocated to various social groups. Along with that, many issues about rights of the disadvantaged groups have come to the fore again.
Dalits, or ‘the untouchables’, constitute a significant section of the disadvantaged populations in Nepal. While many stakeholders associate this problem with Hinduism, Harvard scholar Suraj Yengde from India argues it is a global problem. Yendge claims he has understood multiple dimensions of the issue as he spent a miserable childhood in a Dalit settlement in Maharashtra before he got a scholarship to study at prestigious international institutions like Harvard Kennedy School.
Yengde was recently in Nepal to discuss his new book ‘Caste Matters’. He talked to Onlinekhabar over his growth into a global Dalit scholar and his thesis that an independent global Dalit movement is needed to solve the global issue.
Excerpts:
How did you rise from an underprivileged young boy to an international scholar?
My story reflects the story of most of the Dalits in India and South Asia. Different people came into my life in different life. The most important person in my life was my father, who was a peon at a private bank. As an elder child, he had to take many responsibilities. But, he was really devoted to the social movement of Dalits. He was associated with various organisations. He was educated up to the ninth grade only, but he was learned beyond educational qualifications. He was an activist who was interested in empowering his community.
As a Dalit, the only option you have, except doing your traditional occupation, is education. If you don’t pursue education, you go back to your caste-centered traditional job such as cleaning bathrooms and toilets, doing manual labour.
We belong to a caste called Mahars, we were traditional village servants, not limited to one specific job, but doing all kinds of menial jobs like cleaning the carcass of dead animals. But Mahars were also like militants; they fought against the Brahmins.
Hence, my father decided to educate me because I could have ended up like every other member of my community doing menial jobs. Or I could have turned into a criminal like a pickpocket if not educated.
But how did you pursue your education despite your miserable economic condition?
I grew up below the poverty line. Five members of our family lived in one small room. But, my father wanted to educate his children in an English medium school. All his colleagues did not take it well. They said to him, “You are just a bank peon. The school fee is more than your salary. How can you afford it?” Paradoxically, the manager of my father’s bank had also enrolled his son in the same school. He was my classmate.
Every week, we had a sports hour at school. I did not have additional shoes, so would wear my school shoes for football and other sports. I only had two socks, and they had to be washed again. The same with clothes; it rained the next morning you washed them, you would have to go to the school in wet clothes. Further, if you did not wear your school uniforms, they would ask you to go back home.
But I liked my school because home was not the place that I wanted to live. There was sewage running outside, and it smelled foul every day. Women would be fighting. There used to be filthy abuses. People were literally beating each other. The school was an escape from every such trauma.
So how did your father pay your tuition fees which were higher than his salary?
My education was also supported by my uncles, paternal as well as maternal uncles. My mother would frequently go to sit with her brother and ask him to support me. Because the brother-sister bond is deep in our culture, he would support me. Also, we borrowed money. My mother had one mangalsutra that she always put in pawn to take loans for me.
But still, I could not participate in recreations and other activities in the school. It was a kind of limited education. I used to feel ashamed of my status. I used to lie to my friends about my dad’s profession because they were people of high castes. I used to tell them that he was a bank clerk. In fact, he was a servant to their parents and I didn’t want my schoolmates to know that.
Till when did you remain ashamed of your identity? When did you gather the courage to feel that you had to talk about it?
I got a scholarship to study abroad and went to England for a master’s in law. My specialisation was human rights law. While doing research, I saw that the problem of untouchability was across the continents, in Africa, in Europe, in South Asia, in North and Latin Americas. But, I realised the research has not been done; and hence I had thought the problem I was grappling with was my personal problem, but a structural one.
It was in 2011 only. Since then, I felt good because I was not alone.

Besides that it was a global problem, what were other highlights of your learning and recommendations to cope with them?
We have rejected the humanity of the Dalit population. We have not given them a desired equal respect.
To solve it, the Dalit voice needs to be prioritised. The Dalit women, doubly or triply oppressed, need to be brought to the front. We have to look in a mirror that we have never seen ourselves in. It is important if we want to go to the next level of human achievement. As long as caste system remains there, we cannot go beyond the medieval-era society; we cannot become modern. Even though we have fashionable clothes, our minds will be still rooted in the medieval era thinking.
So far, the cosmetic change has happened, but not the structural one. For that to happen, we have to move away from the medieval-era thinking. If we carry that, our modernity will hit a wall, it will not progress.
Right now, we need an autonomous Dalit identity movement which also makes other caste groups feel that they also need to be a part of it.
Can you please go back and explain what did you mean by the medieval-era thinking and what is the thinking that you want to replace it with?
Nepal still practises untouchability. It was created in the past to make sure that one group has supremacy over another, to make sure that the people working in the farms and fields remained there for generations. The caste system gives it a sanction. In the South Asian society governed by the Hindu ideology, the caste system becomes a religious authority.
If you want to think about the medieval era thinking, think about how many Dalit priests are there in temples of Nepal. How many Dalit politicians are there in Parliament? How many Dalit bureaucrats are there in policy-making positions? How many Dalit independent media enterprises do exist? More importantly, how many Dalits are valued for what they are beyond their caste? You get very negative answers to these questions.
You mean to say the caste system is a problem of the Hindu society. 
What I am advocating right now is the caste problem is a global problem. The term itself is a Portuguese term, meaning ‘division’. If you go to any society, there are structural divisions historically. Muslims, Buddhists, and people believing in every other religion that trusts in the idea of supremacy practice caste. Supremacy exists in Europe also, for example, white supremacy. For me, there is a global Dalit and there is a global Brahmin.
But, there are similarities and differences between these practices. The first similarity is the historic form of oppression continues. The second, it is based on one’s birth; whichever family you are born to defines your lifetime. The third is, it’s structural; structures have been brought in. Fourth, it is personal, people practice caste discrimination based on their personal understanding. Fifth, the system is retained in various cultural forms. Then of course, economically and politically, they are at the bottom. The struggle for economic rights has to be a part of Dalit movements…

Exactly! Many sociologist scholars and the public believe that caste is an outdated issue and it doesn’t have any effect anymore. What matters more is your control over socioeconomic resources, decided by your class.
This is a very farcical argument. It is trying to dissuade and befool the public. Every society that is economically divided has other structures that make the divisions possible. The divisions are not only results of different amounts of control over the capital; the division thrived because the caste system already existed.
If the caste system is outdated, why do the Brahmins still continue to retain their control over the spiritual wealth? Why do they still have a monopoly over the temples? Those who believe that the caste system is outdated have to give up the privileges they had because of their caste.
The caste system is very much intact and it needs to be seriously handled.
But how can you claim that Brahmins and other people have caste privileges? They too have to do a lot of struggles if they don’t have control over socioeconomic resources. Instead, Dalits have privileges in the form of reservation.
In a caste-based society, if you are a Brahmin, you are already 10 steps ahead. Your network is already set up. The very element of being a Brahmin carries a certain privilege. You are not brought up with the ideology of being inferior. You are always taught to rule and command. You are taught to walk in confidence. It’s such an enormous privilege that nobody can take away from you.
Imagine some Dalits living in your community, whose parents are living as servants at other people’s houses or cleaning the sewage of their community. What are these parents going to teach their children? What is the future they will offer to them? They don’t have a vision because they are not taught how to think. More importantly, they don’t have idols–whom they are looking up to where the father is a drunkard and there are altercations with other people in the community?
Caste system takes away confidence from every Dalit person. Compare that with being a Brahmin, who has a monopoly over education for thousands and thousands of years.
So you still believe that a reservation based on caste categories in public service and other sectors is still relevant?
The reservation system is meant to uplift the communities who are not at a similar level. It is an opportunity for all of us to make sure that people who never had access to the resources can come with us. Through reservations, we have a golden opportunity to meet fellow people to come onto a similar plain and have camaraderie.
But now, some people are fighting against the reservation or affirmative actions. These are people who lack confidence, who don’t have merits. If you have merit, come what may, you will still survive. Why are you getting insecure about the people who have come to school for the first time? If you have merit, you should be able to compete with the people of any quality, any talent, and any background.
The reservation system should be more radical. It should go beyond giving seats. It should create more positive discriminations. We should make sure that the system supports the persons belonging to the lower caste to go to the top.
But focusing on the reservation, we are missing a lot. Reservation and other progressive measures should go together. We need more than a reservation.

Should the reservation system continue indefinitely or do we need to set a time limit?
Time limit is subjective. We can say, “Tomorrow, we will finish untouchability.” If we finish it tomorrow, no reservation is needed. But, it’s only imaginative thought. It is just an attempt to befool everyone.
Let’s say, the caste system is a train passing through a village. Its speed is so high that many people are missing out. Reservation provides the people with a mechanism to catch up on the train. But that does not take you to the final destination. Reservation and redistribution of resources have to go side by side. We will need at least 10 to 15 measures like the reservation for us to reach the common goal.
Ending reservation is not a solution. If you want to have equality, there should be a proportional representation of every caste group. Say, if there are 12-13 per cent Brahmins, give them 12-13 per cent reservation. Let their communities get represented proportionally.
Otherwise, it will only end at the moment when you stop treating other Dalit persons as sub-humans, as others not belonging to our group. Don’t worry about ending the reservation. The moment equality will be established, the Dalits themselves will get rid of it.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/everest-season-2019-nepals-image-was-tarnished-due-to-lack-of-coordination-among-expedition-operators-says-ang-tsering-sherpa.html,"
Ang Tshering Sherpa was born in Khumjung Solu Khumbu, to a yak trader and mountain man who befriended Edmund Hillary. Sherpa received his education at a school set up by Hillary. He was involved in mountain various expeditions, helping his father assist climbers. In 1982, he bought a trekking company called Asian Trekking, which grew into a trusted name in the business. Sherpa, who also served as the chair of Nepal Mountaineering Association, is also the President of Climate Alliance of Himalayan Communities (CAHC) and Honorary Consul of Belgium to Nepal. Onlinekhabar’s Shashwat Pant recently talked to Sherpa about mountaineering on Everest and issues that have come to the fore during the climbing season this spring. Translated excerpts:
Let’s begin by talking about the yesterday of mountain climbing in Nepal. How was it different from what it is now?
Until the 1990s, we had a system called the ‘one-team-one route’ system under which only one expedition would be allowed to climb a mountain using one route. But after the restoration of democracy, the government started issuing permits to multiple groups for the same route. There are many routes to mountains such as Everest, but most of them are difficult. There’s one route via the South Col which everyone wants to take.
Similarly, the climbing equipment used to be heavy and bulky. A lot of improvements have been made in the last few years to make thing s more comfortable. There was a time when Sherpas did not have the skills nor the training to climb mountains. We didn’t get weather reports the way we do now. We had to rely on brute force.
In 1963, when the first American expedition came to Nepal, their communication equipment had to be carried by seven porters. But now communications equipment have changed and become smaller. An average bottle of oxygen would weigh around 7-8 kgs. But now it is hardly 3kg.
If you talk about the climbers, things have changed there as well. In the past, we used to have expeditions from specific countries–the government in those countries would sponsor such expeditions. The team members would climb another mountain together before coming to Everest to improve their coordination. But now we have mixed teams whose members do not know each other until they reach base camp.
How important is mountaineering for Nepal’s tourism?
Mountaineering provides employment to so many people and brings money to Nepal. It is also one of the biggest means to promote Nepal. Whenever someone decides to climb Everest, the person talks to the local media about his/her plans. When they come here, they send constant updates saying they have reached base camp, they have set foot on Camp II and so on. Journalists also come to Nepal to cover the expeditions. Their family members friends and sponsors are also interested in what goes on. When someone is done summiting Everest, he/she writes a book, prepares a documentary or presents his/her story before large gatherings. We’ve seen that expedition members have made effective promotion of Nepal.
Over the years, various issues have propped up in the mountaineering business in Nepal. The first of these problems is that Everest is becoming dirty.
The first thing I want to say is that because of climate change, snow is melting and waste that was buried in snow is propping out. The other thing is that in 1993, a photo in an international magazine showed that Everest was becoming a garbage dump. The photo brought a lot of criticism, but it also raised our awareness about the issue.
In 1996, we conducted a clean-up campaign and started a scheme under which we provide cash for waste. The government also introduced a system under which climbers have to deposit a certain amount as a waste deposit. There is an anecdote I want to share. I remember a Russian team making its way to the base camp huffing and puffing and carrying loads of garbage on their back. They were thinking that Nepali officials would come to inspect their waste. But no one came. This shows that we need good monitoring to back up rules to keep the mountain clean.
Do you think mountaineering in Nepal, received a lot of bad press this year especially because of the infamous ‘traffic jam’?
I think we could have easily managed the traffic jam. The representatives of the mountaineering operators’ association tried to coordinate the expeditions, but the operators did not coordinate with them. This year, we had a climbing window from May 21-25. While 60 people made their way to the top on the 21st, 300 attempted to climb the mountain on the 22nd. But on the 24th only 15-16 people attempted, and by 25th everyone had left. If the expeditions had coordinated, then 100 people could have attempted on 22nd, or 50 people on the 23d and so on. They would not have had to stand in line for a long time. The three-hour-long jam tarnished Nepal’s image; as climbers spent time on the line, they got altitude sickness, some of them suffered from frost bites.
Do you think any of the nine deaths this year could be attributed to the traffic jam?
No, one died of the traffic jam this year. What happened was that some of the climbers spent all their energy going up, and they did not have it in them to come down.
The other important issue we face is that of human waste. During the climbing season, which lasts for around one-and-a-half months, we have 700-800 people on a mountain where we don’t have toilets. This is a problem with all popular mountains. For that reason, we came up with the idea of Everest Eco Expedition in 2008. Under the expedition, we bring special bags made in America to dispose of human waste. The bag has special enzymes that decompose human waste. The bag itself is also biodegradable–it degrades in around three years. We bring the human waste to Gorakhshep and bury it in pits. Even if we fail to bring the bags to base camp, it will decompose in three years. I think that all mountaineering companies should use these kinds of bags, the government should also make it mandatory for them to use it.
 

Following reports of deaths on Everest and the government’s decision to issue a record number of permits this year, there have been calls to reform the way permits are issued. Some are saying that the government should make it mandatory for anyone who wishes to climb Everest to at least climb a 6,000m-odd mountain to prove that they are worthy of climbing the highest mountain in the world. It this something new?
Yes, we suggested to the government to implement a rule that would make it mandatory for anyone who wishes to climb Everest to first climb a 7,000m peak. We did that for two reasons, first the climbers themselves would be more confident and second, the human resources we have could be utilised better. But we could not implement the decision as foreign climbers said that mountains in Europe which are only a few thousand metres tall are more difficult to climb than the 7,000m mountains in Nepal. Some diplomats based in Kathmandu were also against the idea so it could not be implemented.
The other issue that comes up regularly is about the local people of the Everest region. While there are people who are benefiting from tourism, there are others who are not involved in the tourism business. How are those people benefiting from tourism giving back to the people who are not?
I understand that the situation is not easy for them. Daily commodities have become expensive because of tourism. There are monks and nuns, along with the elderly, who do not have anything to do with tourism. There are also those people who do not live on popular tourist routes. I think it is the social responsibility of mountaineering operators to help them sustain. When we had a helicopter company, we would ferry essentials such as grains, tea and sugar for these people. But now, they have become more prosperous. Now we are thinking of new ways to help them.
In one of the regions, where we work, the local community chopped down a forest in one year. I asked them if they knew how much time it takes for a forest to grow. They said, “400-500 years.” When I asked them why they’d cut the trees if they knew what went into growing the forest, they said that they cannot keep their families hungry to conserve the forest. Which is why we are starting an awareness campaign to make these people aware of the importance of trees and also the impact of global warming on the mountains.
To wrap up, do you have any vision of how the mountaineering business in Nepal should move forward?
I think the most important thing is to build a system. I would like to share an example. When I went to Europe to climb Mt Blanc, we saw that around 50,000 people come to the base of the mountain– something like our Namche– every year. But when we climbed the mountain, there were around 100 people ahead of us and another 150 behind us. I’d imagined that only around 16,000-17,000 people would climb the mountain every year, but my son told me that more than 21,000 people climb the mountain every year and it was not dirty. They have a strict monitoring mechanism in place. Sagarmatha is 4-5 times bigger than Mt Blanc, we can easily manage it with the right system.
What about the liaison officers? Are they not doing the monitoring?
We say that instead of deploying government officers as liaison officers, the government should deploy climbers to monitor activities on the mountain. The liaison officers cause problems only, even when they are not at base camp. When they do come to base camp–like the 4-5 of the 47 officers this year– they demand chicken and mutton every day and hot water to go the toilet in a place where boiling water is very difficult. There are officers who stay in Namche and play cards the whole day. If they lose, they make the operators pay. Some officers even don’t care to leave Kathmandu. They make arrangements with the airlines to produce fake tickets and hotels in Namche to produce fake bills.",/interview,"Tue, 02 Jul 2019 04:51:54 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/dozens-of-nepalis-lose-their-lives-to-overseas-waters-every-year-why-are-they-at-a-higher-risk.html,"
A local news portal in Sudurpaschim province of Nepal, Dinesh Khabar, reported on January 12 that a Nepali in Malaysia died after falling into a fishery. Just two days after that, a United States-based news portal run by Nepalis there reported the death of two Nepalis in Portugal while they were fishing in a sea.
Researchers say these two incidents, reported in the same week from different parts of the world, are just the tip of the iceberg. They suggest dozens of Nepalis drown abroad every year and it is ever increasing. They argue that the lack of swimming culture in Nepal contributes a lot to the problem, advocating for practical measures to be exercised by the government, the migrant workers and students and other stakeholders.
The intensity of the problem
No one knows the exact numbers of Nepalis killed in aquatic accidents abroad in a specific period. Forget about specialised data about fatal drowning cases, the government does not have any records about exactly how many Nepalis die abroad, due to whatever causes, in a specific period. Suresh Adhikari, the information officer at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, says Nepali embassies in the countries which host Nepalis in a big number might have such a data system, but there are not any integrated records. Therefore, there are not sufficient data to prove the intensity of the problem.
However, the concerned government agencies have also agreed that the problem is significant and it needs immediate attention. Subsequently, recordkeeping has started to some extent. The Nepali Embassy in Australia, for example, has been recording the deaths of Nepalis due to drowning since 2016. A senior official of the embassy informs that 10 deaths have been recorded since then. It means two Nepalis died in the water every year on an average.
“As the number of Nepali migrants is increasing every year here, the number of fatalities is also going up,” Dila Kharel, a leader of the Non-resident Nepali Association in Australia, says, adding there could be some unrecorded cases also.
The Royal Life Saving Society Australia has a different data set, but it has also noticed that a significant number of Nepalis are losing their lives to Australian waters. “The Nepali community has been identified as an emerging community at risk, with 14 drowning deaths recorded in six years (2013/14 – 2018/19),” the society’s Research and Policy Manager Stacey Pidgeon says, “It does not include three most recent drowning deaths of Nepalis in the last few weeks.”

Researchers believe the problem is not restricted to Australia only. Puspa Raj Pant, a Nepali injury prevention researcher currently based in Britain, says Nepali communities living in all coastal cities in different parts of the world are at risk. Stating that he read news reports about drowning deaths of Nepalis from different countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Australia, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Japan and India in the past few years, he says both Nepali migrant workers and students face equal risks.
Pant estimates that at least two dozen Nepalis drown abroad every year.
The Nepali side of the universal problem
Of course, Nepalis are at the risk of aquatic accidents, but is this problem only a concern for Nepalis? After all, anyone who cannot swim is prone to losing their life if they surf or swim, notwithstanding their nationality or origin. Why should it bother Nepalis only? Why is the number of deaths among Nepalis higher than that in other communities?
Pant explains, “As Nepal does not have sea or beaches, Nepalis do not have any experience of waves, tides or water current, nor are there any places where one can learn about water safety or seawater safety.” Pidgeon also agrees, “Key risk factors for drowning include lack of swimming skills and being unfamiliar with the environment. We know that many people come to Australia as adults and may not have had the opportunity to learn swimming and water safety skills previously yet they still participate in risk-taking behaviours.”

Similarly, Pant says, “To be honest, we Nepalis tend to underestimate the hazards, perhaps comparing the seawater with water in rivers and streams in our countries. This is the biggest mistake.” He thinks Nepalis are more innocent than ignorant, about such risks. “I feel sorry and have sympathy for those who have lost lives. But, I am not blaming them; it is about our culture that is responsible.”
The embassy official believes a section of the problem also attributes to carelessness, “Sometimes, many Nepalis swim under the influence of alcohol.”
Likewise, the people who are not familiar with the beach recreational activities find it exciting to visit a beach and many of them want to jump into the water straight away, the Australian researcher explains her observation. Her theory seems realistic in the experiences of Nepalis living abroad.
As a child brought up in Nepal, Pjay Shrestha moved to Australia along with his family in 1999, when he was just six. He shares that his experiences with rivers in Nepal and seas in Australia were different. “The way Australian beach water flows is different than the rivers in Nepal; it can be very deep in a few seconds.”
“It is one of the reasons many schools in Australia teach swimming and beach safety at a young age.” Shrestha also learned surfing lessons at school, which he realised was essential for him to go to the sea.
Being raised in a different environment is not a problem, but being deprived of adequate knowledge and skills to become familiar with the new environment is a real issue, according to Shrestha. “Many Nepali young people who move abroad from Nepal these days do not get any training about beach safety. There is a serious gap regarding information such as you should swim between yellow flags. This is the biggest cause of the problem.”
Domestic solutions of the overseas problem
Though the fatalities take place abroad, the most practical solutions to the problem should be sought in Nepal, before Nepalis, migrant workers or students alike, fly abroad, according to the stakeholders.
Passing English language tests such as the IELTS is not enough for the young Nepali students to keep themselves safe and easy in Australia, says Shrestha, adding, they also need to study a lot about Australian culture and activities they will engage in, including potential dangers related to exposure to water, before leaving the homeland.
Similarly, Pant suggests, “Nepal must include some modules to educate about potential hazards of being into or near the sea and beaches. This will alert people right from the beginning.”
The official at Nepal’s embassy in Canberra also agrees, “We have advised concerned agencies in Kathmandu to give some information about this issue as well before their departure.” The official also adds that the embassy, the NRNA and other organisations of Nepalis have been carrying out some awareness-raising activities in the foreign land also, of late.
“We feel very sad for the students and their parents, who had such unfortunate accidents. Our focus now is reducing such cases and work closely with the NRNA and other community organisations,” the official says.",/lifestyle,"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 04:42:08 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/this-man-cannot-walk-now-he-hopes-his-artworks-will-take-him-around-the-world.html,"Ramesh Barahi
For the past six years, Ramesh Barahi has been trying his hand at painting, but he does not have the comfort of boasting himself as an artist at various events and gatherings. Owing to a physical disability, he cannot move alone.
Yet, this 32-year-old man from Sundhara of the ancient Patan city in Kathmandu is committed to continuing his struggle to make himself recognised as an artist and support his family with the proceeds. He also wants to inspire others, ‘abled’ and ‘differently-abled’ alike.
“I love to paint when I am happy or bored,” Barahi says, “I never feel limited because of my condition.” Instead, he has perceived painting as a medium that would help him explore the world.
Overcoming limitations
A person with short stature, Barahi suffers a medical condition named hydrocephalus, in which there is excessive cerebrospinal fluid in his brain.  His bones are also fragile. Therefore, he cannot move whenever he wants. He needs a wheelchair or a walker to roam around.
“My parents were hopeless that I should live,” Barahi explains, “because my limbs were like cotton.”
Commuting has always been an issue for Barahi. “Public buses do not usually stop for us. Even taxis are reluctant to take us because of our wheelchair,” he says, “When they are ready, they ask more money.”

He loves to go around Mangal Bazaar, which is in a ten-minute walking distance from his house during the evenings, but the road turns out to be a hellish experience for him.
“The road is not as good as it was in the past,” Barahi expresses his dissatisfaction.  “Normal people can walk there. They do not have experiences of using a wheelchair.”
Now, he recommends, “They need to understand our problem. In other countries, there are disabled friendly infrastructures. The roads should be equally accessible to everyone. Our needs are not prioritised much. And we are never into the limelight. I feel sad that the differently-abled are not in the government’s priority.”
Yet, so far, his confidence has been his lifeblood, and of late he has found the medium of colours to assert his presence. “Even if I cannot be mobile much, I wish my art explored the world. It would mean that I would be going everywhere through my art.
Struggle to make living
Perhaps confidence is not enough to make a living. Hence, this confident man turns restless whenever people talk about his earning.
“I am not as economically independent as I wish to be” Barahi reflects on his experiences. “People usually spectate. My paintings are piling up and I do not sell them much. People do not understand my needs. People have asked me to draw their portraits before. But when I quote my price, they think it’s expensive.”
But even in these hard times, his family has supported him. “I get very depressed sometimes but I talk to my father or meet my friends to forget these pains.”
“Others tell me that I am lucky to have very caring parents. They tell stories of other people living with different disabilities being locked or chained. They say I have freedom. I myself met a few people who were chained during my treatment at Patan Community-based Rehabilitation Organisation (Patan CBR).”
Barahi has found a brother is an employee of his father’s handicraft workshop because he, too, cannot speak and hear. Yet, the father has mobilised him in assisting Barahi in his daily activities.
Ramesh Barahi is flanked by his father (left) and a man who assists him to roam around.
“We go out together and he takes me around, pushing my wheelchair. I signal him and he understands my gestures.”
Now, Barahi wants some woman to marry him so that she could provide him emotional support whenever needed.
“I wish I had a life partner. I will not have my parents or Raj Kumar Dai (his dad’s employee) around me all the time. I might need someone to take care of me. But people laugh at this. They do not understand that I have a life to spend.”
Becoming an artist
Due to his disabilities, Barahi could not complete his school. He dropped out in the seventh grade.
“My school was half an hour away from my home,” he remembers. “Although I had good friends and good teachers, I couldn’t go to school anymore. There was a person in my father’s workshop that used to take me to school on his bicycle. Later he went abroad.”

The struggle to become an artist was even harder. “My legs are weak. I wanted to go to take art classes, but I could not. I used to cry. I wanted to learn but I had no one to teach me. “
Eventually, he started taking art classes with Erina Tamrakar, a renowned Nepali contemporary artist.
“At first, it was hard for my teacher to teach me painting. But understanding my condition, she changed her approach. She helped me put my hand in the right position to hold a pencil and held my hand herself so that I could move it on the paper.”
Building on her lessons, Barahi has had three art exhibitions so far. Currently, he runs a gallery, Barahi Kalaa Kwotha, near his home in Sundhara, Patan.

Once, Barahi had an opportunity to meet and gift the executive chief of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, his portrait during Dahal’s premiership. Barahi recalls, “It was one of my best experiences so far.”
Asserting the self
In a society where differently-abled people are treated well, out of pity or sympathy rather than respect, Barahi is trying hard to make his self-esteem high as an artist.
“Contemporary artists are more respected today than yesterday. I feel happy to be recognised.  I get constructive criticism sometimes. In my exhibition at Bhrikutimandap, there were many who commented on what I could improve upon.”
But some of his social experiences are bad too. He frequently feels bullied by his neighbours and others. But instead of limiting his endeavours, such encounters make him stronger to assert the identity of differently-abled persons in society.
Therefore, he has recently gathered two other differently-abled friends and begun doing the art together.  “We enjoy each other’s company very much. Sometimes, we dance together,” Barahi happily shares, “We worked together on painting and sold it abroad.”

Despite all the odds, Barahi is proud of what he has achieved so far. “I feel I have done respectable work. I am proud of my artworks. People talk to me with respect.”
“But I wish those who respect me would also buy my paintings so that I could live a dignified life.”",/lifestyle,"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 03:44:03 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/what-astha-rauts-father-has-to-say-about-the-airport-controversy.html,"Hari Bahadur Raut
Hari Bahadur Raut is a renowned folk musician of the country. However, since the past week, people are identifying her as the father of Astha Raut. As Astha is also a popular singer of the country, Hari Bahadur should have been proud of the identity.
In fact, he is always proud of his daughter. That’s why he recently came to Onlinekhabar to apologise on behalf of his daughter.
Since Astha’s reported disagreement with a police staffer at the Tribhuvan International Airport on January 15, she has earned an ill repute. If that is not enough, police have been given a warrant for her arrest.
So what does Hari Bahadur feel these days?
—
Hari Bahadur was busy with his own stuff when it happened. He knew his daughter was heading to Sikkim for a tour. However, with hectic schedules on both sides, there was not much communication in between. With Astha’s remarkable popularity, it was nothing new for the parents that she was not home. Sometimes Astha could not even update her parents about her schedule. She would always be rushing.
Hariba Hadur, however, has devised a trick to learn about her trips. “When she is touring abroad, she leaves the small suitcase at home”, he says. “And when she is visiting within Nepal, she leaves the big one.” She had taken away her smaller case last week.
—
Hari Bahadur was unaware of the incident before he was called by a journalist. The caller had viewed Astha’s live Facebook post that had gone viral on the day of Maghe Sankranti. As the report told him about the video, Hari Bahadur also checked the post. Meanwhile, his phone kept ringing.
“My daughter behaves aggressively”, Hari Bahadur says, “She is reactive to unjust treatment. She speaks her heart out. Her reaction was probably caused by some bad treatment.” Nevertheless, the confident man maintains, “But she also did not choose her words much wisely either.”
Later, the CCTV footage of the quarrel leaked out. It too received mixed reactions from the public. While some people have consoled Astha, others have criticised her actions. What does Hari Bahadur think about it?
“You cannot hear any audio there”, he says. “It is, hence, hard to jump into any conclusion. The only thing I can say about it is that, if the policewoman had not used any foul language, my daughter would not have reacted as such. There must have been mistakes from both sides.”

“Maybe wrong actions were taken by both parties,” he adds, siding with his daughter “But everyone has a right to speak the truth. What would be the difference between the Panchayat System and the modern days if one has to fear to speak for themselves?”
As the case is under police investigation, he states that he could not express much about it. “The police have received a warrant against my daughter. I am waiting for what happens next.”
But, he does not believe that his daughter will be taken into custody.
“The police have their own responsibilities. Many culprits of crimes such as rapes and murders are still at large. I do not think that the police system at whole will be after my daughter for few bad choices of words.”
—
Hari Bahadur also accuses the media of making a mountain out of the mole. He says he has been hurt by headlines such as “Astha Raut at large”.
“Everyone knows that my daughter is touring Sikkim at present. She has agreed to assist in the ongoing investigation. She will return when her programme ends. She might cut short her schedule if the police want her here. How can anyone claim that my daughter is into hiding? How can media personnel report the only one-sided story?”
“Although she seems stubborn outside, she has a very soft heart. She gets emotional very soon. She has cried many times over the phone since the incident. She has committed to reporting everything to the police,”
He is also dissatisfied with the police for filing a case regarding the matter.
“Such things can be settled with a discussion with the concerned party. No one benefits in raising such issues. The country will be in loss as it is celebrating the Visit Nepal Nepal 2020 as artists are also promoting the campaign nationally and internationally.”",/lifestyle,"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 04:53:43 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kokroma-blending-the-uniqueness-of-nepali-bhoto-with-european-business-tricks.html,"A child wears Kokroma daura-suruwal.
Rewati Gurung was well-exposed to the western world during her formative years. She studied English literature in her master’s first and moved to development studies–both courses were dominated by theories and examples from America and Europe. Consequently, her brain was programmed to think that foreigners, whites in particular, were better than Nepalis.
In 2015, Gurung attended a summer school in Finland, during which she learned about the impacts of ‘Finnish Baby Box‘, a cradle along with a package of clothes uniquely designed for newly born infants and their moms after World War II. Three years later, she ordered one such box to be delivered to her in Kathmandu, all the way from Helsinki. Having seen some women-led enterprises in Nepal, Gurung was thinking if any Nepali woman could replicate the Finnish model. It was a part of her personal research.
Gurung’s ‘colonised’ brain was expecting some ‘scientifically-designed’ and ‘real European’ items in the box. “But, I was shocked…,” when the filmmaker-cum-enterprises narrates it after nearly two years, the ‘shock’ is reflected on her face again, “… because that box had something exactly like our bhoto.” [Bhoto is a typically-designed homemade vest for children in Nepal.]
That ‘Finnish bhoto’ brought a paradigm shift in her mind. At first, it compelled her to research why Nepali and Finnish societies have the same kinds of apparel for babies. After completing the research, she decided that she would follow, not replicate, the business model and design a ‘Nepali’ baby box instead. Once the white-is-better thinker, Gurung today owns a startup named Kokroma that manufactures and sells Nepali-design baby clothes.
The science of Nepali baby garments

The findings of Gurung’s informal research were interesting. She got answers to the questions like why a bhoto usually has an inner layer (bhitri), why it has laces (tunas) instead of buttons, and why they fill pillows with mustard seeds.
“From old grannies in my extended family and neighbourhood, I learned that the inner layer of your bhoto has two functions: it absorbs sweat, and it protects the baby’s soft skin from the less soft outer,” she elaborates, “Likewise, the laces were scientific because the kids could swallow buttons.”
She also learned that the Nepali society preferred pure cotton for baby clothing “because it is a natural fibre; it does not cause any harm even if the baby chews and swallows it.” Similarly, mustard seeds are filled in the pillows because they help the baby put the head in a right posture. “You cannot use millet seeds or anything similar because millet easily breaks into dust and it has a certain smell that makes the infant sneezing.”
Having learned the rationale of the old science and seen Europeans following the same, Gurung then decided to produce a ‘Nepali baby box’. She initially thought she would also use cardboards to make the bed/box as it is handier than a kokro, a traditional Nepali bamboo crib. “But, as I began exploring, I found several advantages of the kokro,” she explains, “The flooring in Nepali houses is not as fine as it is in other countries. Cardboards are not much sustainable on such floors.”
Therefore, Gurung not only included a kokro in her production list, but she also made it her brand name. [‘Kokroma’ means inside a kokro.]
Empowering women
Gurung says there is another story behind the establishment of Kokroma, besides her summer school experience.
Kokroma employs six tailors, all women, and Gurung claims she pays them a ‘fair wage’.
After attending an all-women filmmaking workshop in 2017, Gurung independently produced a documentary featuring Drichu, a local clothing brand of Bauddha. Building on this experience, Gurung and Finnish filmmaker Gary Wornell applied for a World Bank-assisted project run by the Poverty Alleviation Fund. They were selected and assigned to make documentaries featuring women entrepreneurs from across the country.
“Between December 2017 and February 2018, we travelled from Taplejung to Dailekh and collected stories about Dhaka weaving, Mithila art, hemp clothes and bamboo baskets,” Gurung recalls, “Overall, what these women were doing was impressive, but I was not happy for them because they did not have access to the market. The sustainability of their business was questionable.”
Gurung compared the businesses with Drichu, also led by a woman, and found “it was far successful because it had a market. It was established as a brand.” She then thought about what other enterprises could be appropriate for starting-up women in Nepal. That was the time she remembered the Finnish Baby Box and ordered it.
“Yet, it was clear that I was not going to be an entrepreneur. That was not my cup of tea; I hated maths throughout the school. There was no one in my family from this background,” she says, “I was thinking it for Nepali women in general.” But the ‘shock’ [discussed above] brought her here.
Because the initial idea was empowering women, Gurung says she has been keeping it at the centre. “During my research, I found that many prisoners, including many women, are involved in weaving cotton, but they did not have sufficient market. Hence, I approached the Central Jail in Kathmandu for cooperation and we have become a market for them till today.”
Kokroma employs six tailors, all women, and Gurung claims she pays them a ‘fair wage’.
‘Not a bed of roses’
While Gurung believes in a fair pay policy, it seems her products sold well from day one. “Nope, they didn’t,” Gurung laughs before immediately wearing a  sad mask on her face, “The first days were as frustrating as hell. By December 2018, we made 20 sets but no one purchased it. Then I approached my relatives.”
“One afternoon in February this year, I went to a relative with my set. She didn’t like it. I got disappointed.” Gurung went to a coffee shop in Bauddha “just to cool down.” She had the rejected apparel set in her hand.
“At the cafe, beside me appeared a foreign lady who asked me what I was carrying. I explained it to her. She listened to me carefully and gave me her email address, suggesting I could write to her if I would ever need any financial support for the project,” the woman recalls, “I didn’t believe. A five-minute meeting cannot lead you to any fund. Nevertheless, I wrote to her.”
The Kokroma team frequently has fun during work, claims Gurung.
After a few days, she got the response, a commitment to provide USD 15,000 as a grant in different instalments. Cristina Henriquez from the US has provided her USD 6,000 so far. Gurung hired her first staff and purchased seven secondhand sewing machines with Henriquez’ support. So far, in total, Gurung has spent around two million (USD 20,000 approximately) in the business.
In the meantime, Wornell, the Finnish filmmaker, helped her promote the products in the international market. He also designed the brand’s website and other publicity materials. Today, Gurung considers Wornell her mentor and an integral part of the team. The sexagenarian is living in Nepal for the next two years to study Nepali language, and she hopes to ‘exploit’ his expertise during this period for Kokroma’s promotion.
After passing through depressing days, Kokroma has just been a self-sustaining business, Gurung claims, adding her monthly revenue is Rs 200,000 whereas monthly expense amounts to around Rs 100,000 these days.
“But, there are still many challenges for startups,” Gurung says adding Nepali customers think that made-in-Nepal products should be cheaper than the imported ones irrespective of the quality.  “The customers do not recognise and respect local brands and we want to change it.”

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/this-72-year-old-rides-his-bike-nine-hours-a-day-because-he-loves-working.html,"Mangal Man Maharjan ferries passengers on his motorbike, around nine hours every day.
Call Mangal Man Maharjan and he will ask ‘where are you?’ before you tell him who you are and why you are calling.
Like hundreds of motorcyclists working for ride-sharing apps Tootle and Pathao in Nepal, Maharjan is accustomed to asking your location every time you call. But, he is strikingly different from most of the riders.
Seventy-two is past the retirement age for most Nepalis, but septuagenarian Maharjan works nine hours every day.
However, he does not have any compulsion to earn living for his family; his children are all grown up and they have been supporting him.
So why does this man ride to ferry people from here to there every day?
The youthful old man
Maharjan looks too old to be a ‘professional’ biker–his hairs are grey and he has already lost many of his teeth. Yet, he tries to show himself ‘young’ to suit the profession: he regularly colours his hair. More importantly, perhaps, an inner zeal makes his face glow.
It was not his hair colour or wrinkled face that posed challenges to his decision to join the job. But, his unfamiliarity with smartphones certainly became an issue. Initially, he feared that he could not do it.
Mangal Man Maharjan learned to use a smartphone from his grandson.
“I even did not know how to answer a call on such phones,” Maharjan says opening Pathao app on his cell, “But my grandson helped me.”
Chronic traffic jams are another challenge for him, but Maharjan has already learned not to lose patience. Whenever he is caught in congestion, he explores if there are alternative routes.
The alley that leads to Maharjan’s house in Ghattekulo of Kathmandu is quite narrow, so he is used to passing through confined paths.
The alley that leads to Maharjan’s house in Ghattekulo of Kathmandu is quite narrow.
Further, it is his experience that has helped him get ready for the job. He worked as a driver for the entire youth of his life. In the first 17 years, he drove trucks. Then, he worked as a night bus driver on different routes.
While driving the bus, Maharjan once got an opportunity to work as a chauffeur for a chief justice of the Supreme Court. That was not a permanent job but Maharjan was content with it because he thought being the chief justice’s chauffeur was more respectful than being a truck driver. “But, the wife of my boss began nagging me as if she was paying for me. That made me quit,” he remembers.
Following that, Maharjan bought a taxi and began driving it. For whatever reason, he gave up that also after three years. He joined a paint shop as a driver again.
One day, he was caught by a traffic police staffer for a minor road discipline issue. He was fined Rs 500. When he asked the employer to give him the money, the employer said, “I won’t pay the next time.”

Maharjan felt that the employer’s statement hurt his dignity and instantly replied, “Okay sir, I will not drive your vehicle the next day.”
He briefly worked for a doctor but left again after realising that his employer was not happy with him.
So why riding again?
“When I left my last job, I slept at home for three days–because I had nothing to do. But, I was restless on the fourth day; I felt my body ached. The longer you sleep, the more your body hurts,” Maharjan says he was tired of passivity.
From the next day, he began spending the entire afternoon with his pet bird, a nightingale. He was happy with it, but he was not satisfied.

Around the same time, he learned about Pathao.
A few days later, he shared with his family, “I want to register myself as a Pathao rider.” There are four other members in his family: a son, two daughters-in-law and a grandson. His wife died 12 years ago whereas the elder son is in Dubai for work.
“I thought the rider’s job would give me some money whereas I can kill my time easily. Then, you would get a sound sleep. No tension!” It has been around five months since he joined the job.
Maharjan’s daily routine changed since then. He wakes up at 4, takes his favourite breakfast of suji haluwa (a semolina dish), eggs and tea. Then he feeds the pet bird before leaving for the job at around 7. Maharjan does not have anyone to order him how long he should work every day, but he usually takes the last passenger before 4 in the afternoon.

“How old are you?” is the most frequently asked question for Maharjan these days. Some of the ride-sharers tell stories about elderly members of their families. “My dad is also of your age, but he is hospitalised now… my dad cannot walk well, but you drive perfectly… Some of them take selfies with me. They love me, respect me,” he smiles.
“My family also doesn’t like me working,” he says, “They tell me, ‘no more work, stay at home’. But, I love working. I will continue working as long as I can.”",/lifestyle,"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 04:16:17 +0000"

As you pass by the misty Kanyam tea gardens in the Ilam District of eastern Nepal, you will come across bunches of hard cheese hanging in most of the shops.
The hard cheese, known locally as chhurpi, is made from milk collected from naks (female yaks), cows and chauris (a cross between yaks and local hill cows). An excellent source of protein, people throughout the Himalayan region, including Tibet, Darjeeling and Sikkim, and Bhutan, love this hard-to-chew cheese.
However, chhurpi is now a favoured food for dogs in the United States and Europe:

According to the Nepal government’s Trade and Export Promotion Centre, in the fiscal year 2017/18, the country exported more than 800 million Nepalese Rupees (US $7 million) worth of chhurpi. According to local businessmen, about 60-70 percent of the chhurpi exported as dog chew to the United States and Europe is produced in the Ilam district itself.

Most cheese varieties tend to be soft, how do they harden this cheese? After collection, the milk is boiled and the fat removed. They then separate the solids from the milk, wrap them in a jute bag to squeeze out the water from the chhurpi, and dry it by putting it out in the sun or by hanging it over a fire.
Godawari International Private Limited, which exports chhurpi as dog chew to India, Japan, Taiwan, Canada, and the United States, explains its rigorous manufacturing process:
[…] Once the milk has cooled down, it is treated with 10 ml of lime juice and 10 mg salt for about 100 gallons of milk. The sour of the mild acid coagulates the milk and the salt speeds up the process. The solids are then separated using a burlap sac [sic], which is washed several times using warm water to remove the whey, and any hints of salt and lime juice.
The solids in the burlap sack are then subjected to squeezing for about 3 weeks when the cake obtained contains at most 5% moisture. The cakes are pressed using weights to remove the excess moisture.
The cake is then cut to size and prepared for cooking [sic] under the sun and smoke[d] for 2-3 months. […]

The idea to market chhurpis as dog food came from brothers Suman and Sujan Shrestha who, together with Nishes Shrestha, started the company Himalayan Dog Chew in 2003. The idea was sparked when one of the brothers noticed a dog gnawing at a chhurpi. In 2007, they launched their product at a pet fair in Bellingham, Washington. Since then, the company has come a long way: it is currently the largest exporter of Himalayan cheese out of Nepal, employing more than 9,000 people. In 2015, these three Nepali entrepreneurs appeared on the popular American TV show Shark Tank, even though they were already making over US $5 million in sales a year.
Many other companies have since followed their lead, but Himalayan Dog Chew has now diversified, evolving from a single product-oriented business into a full pet supply company. According to its website, the company now proudly partners with a third-generation dairy farm in Washington State, which produces 10 million pounds of milk per month and over 124 million pounds per year, all for Himalayan Pet Supply.
Since this hard cheese is being exported to so many countries, including Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States, its manufacture has become a regular source of income for Nepal’s rural farmers.
To stay afloat in the market, however, manufacturers and exporters need to make sure they keep re-engineering and diversifying the product:

My little bean is losing a few teeth, partially because of @himalayanpet’s yak milk chew. Devastated that I gave her something that broke her teeth & caused her so much pain. So be aware that these chews are problematic at best and potentially dangerous, esp. for older dogs. pic.twitter.com/qlZ7e7F2hX

As per the company’s advisory, the chews might cause choking, indigestion, blockage and breakage of teeth and so advise constant supervision of dogs during consumption.

It is quite unusual for villagers of remote Bajura district as they see 18 people from diverse backgrounds, from youth to senior citizens, busy collecting the field data using the GPS (global positioning system) and smartphones.
But recently, the locals of Budhiganga municipality of the district got trained recently to digitally map their resources, landmarks and upload them on the global open platforms called OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap is a global initiative to create a complete map contributed by the volunteers which are freely available for everyone to use in the future.
“We wish to create a task force who are readily available to map their own area whenever needed, we are confident that this will contribute to addressing the data gaps and will be crucial in the context of new federal structure,” says Uttam Pudasaini, a leader of the team who trained locals in Bajhang and Bajura districts.
Confident locals
Participants showed great enthusiasm to map their areas as the results were visible instantly online. The experts’ team had remotely mapped whole areas of Bajhang and Bajura beforehand. Some information from the remote map about two municipalities was validated by the participants who collected the field-based data. A total of 41 locals from the two districts participated in the training and made contributions to the validation.

Mira Kumari Joshi, an information technology officer in Khaptad Chhededaha rural municipality, was one of these participants. She says, “We face many difficulties due to unavailability of the digital information about our region and now we are confident that we will be able to map our own area and use this to fulfil our own needs.”
Likewise, Khadak Singh Bista, a local school principal, says, “These kinds of technical skills need to be transferred to the local communities, which could greatly contribute to supporting local level developmental efforts”.
Support for development planning
With the new federal structure in place, the local units seem to be suffering from data deficiency and they have to start it over from level zero. Most of the municipalities are still in the process of producing their municipality profile. Most importantly, if someone wishes to visit the municipality and ward offices from outside, their location is not available online. The only way is to ask local people about the location and rely on them, which sometimes might not be accurate.

During the fieldwork in Bajhang and Bajura, this team found out that even the government authorities like ward offices were not digitally mapped and it was very difficult to find the location for outsiders and even for the community people.
Hence, Deepak Shah, mayor of the Budhiganga municipality, states, “These kinds of information are important in making the development plans and also tracking the road development in the area”.
Information for resilience
Bajura is considered to be one of the most disaster-prone districts of the country. It is impacted by a diverse range of disasters. The situation is exacerbated by the impacts of global environmental changes. In this context, location-based information can play an important role during emergencies in this age of technology.

In cases of humanitarian emergencies, this information will be crucial as the information about key services including health posts, financial services, first aid, and the security forces are available online, for free. Also, if any humanitarian actors wish to use this information for planning any activities, these data can be very helpful.  The community-mapped open spaces can also be used for evacuation, safe shelters and spots for landing helicopters during emergency situations.
On September 16, 2019, the Sanphe-Martadi road section at Balde of Budhiganga municipality in Bajura was blocked due to a massive landslide. There were many other active landslides in the districts, not mapped and located. With this mapping effort, some of the major landslides have been mapped and are available online. Most importantly, local people have been empowered to fill the data gap in the future.",/lifestyle,"Thu, 05 Dec 2019 04:44:47 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sarauto-movie-review-story-speaks-louder-than-action.html,"
What is a ‘sarauto’ anyway? Arguably, many Nepali cinemagoers of the young generation are not familiar with the term. Making a movie with such a difficult word in the title and featuring a non-star cast is really a risky affair. However, the producers dared to do it and the movie is already on the screen now.
This week’s Kollywood release might exceed your expectations you may have set considering its strange title. Even with the non-star team, debutant director Hari Humagain has done an impressive job.
Raghav Krishna Gautam’s intriguing story and dialogues compensate for the so-so acting and overall presentation of the movie. Despite several flaws, the movie keeps most members of the audience hooked, and it deserves applause as the majority of contemporary Nepali ‘action’ films are boring and unsubstantial.
Action with love story and family drama    
First, be clear that Sarauto is not only an action movie; it is also an emotional love story and a family drama. This is the first reason why this movie can offer you something more than what you have expected.
Nepali action movies have not received good reviews in the past. They are found to be imitating Bollywood action patterns, but failing to meet the standard. Sarauto might not be any exception.
However, the action is not the only thing that you can look forward to in this movie. It also has a beautiful, though tragic, love story, and heightened family conflict. These elements enable the movie to appeal to different groups of the audience, for different reasons.

Sarauto’s love story is unique. The way that the heroine (Sumi Moktan) and the hero (Sunny Singh) meet is quite common, but the way they develop their intimacy is arguably peculiar. (Further description of this ‘way’ could be a spoiler!) Like other love story movies, this film also includes a couple of songs. However, the songs essentially do not contribute anything to the overall impact of the movie.
The movie also offers you an emotionally-charged family drama. This is not as beautiful as the love story, because it has a bias. The movie reinforces a prejudiced idea about adopted children of the family (again, a further description of this argument should not be revealed here). But, notwithstanding the bias, the drama is worth watching.
This film obviously includes other regular components of an action movie: revenge, betrayal, fight, and bloodsheds. If you love foreign action movies and want to see how Nepali filmmakers are also learning tricks of the genre, go watch it and judge on your own.
Cinematic presentation
Because the movie’s director is an experienced cinematographer, the movie’s visual language clearly communicates its message. As the plot moves between the past and the present, several flashback scenes are included in the movie. The chronological (present) and flashback (past) scenes have been effectively connected into a sequence hence there is not much confusion.
Nevertheless, a few incidents from the past–for example, the heroine’s conversation with her dad about ‘the greatest thing in life’–are repeated many times, and it might force the audience to lose their interest. Likewise, some flashback scenes, for example Jeetjung (Leo Tank) narrating his past and his transformation into a villain, are too quick.

Moreover, the first half of the movie baffles you. You see three parallel storylines. All of them merge into the one some minutes before the intermission. Because you can easily understand the development of events since then, the plot can become more interesting.
The writer and the director have tried to make some scenes symbolic, but they do not work much effectively. In the movie’s trailer, you can see the hero expressing a metaphor of rivers and bridges about human separations and connections. This does not appeal much as it is already used too much.
The biggest symbols used in the movie are the ‘sarauto’ an ‘Om’-sign locket. The sarauto symbolism is quite clear, neither is it problematic for the tool is associated with the antagonist forces. But there is a big problem with the Om locket. Because the sign is a common symbol of Hinduism, the movie using it to refer to the villain is offensive and insensitive to the biggest religious group of the country.
Acting
As the lead, Sumi Moktan has done a nice job. Her acting is not perfect, but she has left an impression and shown the potential of further development in the field. Her male counterpart, Sunny Singh is also commendable. He is cool, gentle and handsome as demanded by his role. He has been seen natural all the time, even when he acts drinking, and it is his biggest strength. Parakram PJB Rana as the hero’s confidant has also proved his capacity in acting. In his debuting project, Leo Tank (Tanka Dhamala) has also made since efforts to act alive though at times his acting looks immature and artificial. He, of course, has space for improvement, but he must have caught other directors’ eye for a villain’s role in the future. Sampada Dahal cannot shine much.

Among the artists playing supporting roles, Aruna Karki and Vijaya Lama’s performance is memorable. However, it is not only because of their long experiences, but also due to the positive roles they are given. Dhiren Shakya and Yubaraj Lama are average.
Verdict
Though promoted as an action movie, Sarauto’s story is more appealing than the action. It deserves your two hours and a quarter, plus a ticket of a few hundred rupees.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/why-everyone-needs-to-worry-about-first-case-of-malaria-parasites-in-nepali-buffalos.html,"File: A buffalo farm in Nepal
Nepali zoologists have reported the first case of the malaria parasite in water buffalos in Nepal. The alarming discovery places thousands of farmers who rear buffalos and their cattle across the country at risk.
Scientists, who uncovered the presence of the hitherto unnoticed parasites, say besides farmers, the non-farming urban group is also at risk, almost equally. Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation’s Deputy Director-General Ram Chandra Kandel, who led the research in 2017, informs that buffalo meat-eaters in the urban areas constitute the most vulnerable group in Nepal. “Multiple studies have found out that eating meat from diseased animals can cause various ailments.”
The finding
Interestingly, the study was not carried out as an independent research project. It was a by-product of Kandel’s PhD research. “My primary concern, for the PhD, was threats to wild water buffalos in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve caused by the assimilation of domestic buffalos with the wild buffalos,” he says, “In the process; I wanted to see major diseases troubling them.”
To find out the presence of diseases in the animal, Kandel mobilised a team of other scientists to conduct the study, who hinted that the animals could be suffering from malaria.
The team collected blood samples from 56 water buffalos including 16 wild, 23 feral and 17 domestic. Of 16 wild buffalos, 13 were from the wildlife reserve whereas three were captives of the central zoo of Nepal. The domestic and feral buffalos were taken from human settlements outside the wildlife reserve. In total, three were 32 female and 24 male buffalos. Whereas the team could not identify the age of 18 buffalos, the other 38 were 15-day to 15-year-old.
During the study, one feral and one domestic buffalo were found to be contaminated with malaria parasites. “This is just four percent of our sample size, but given the implications and the lack of measures to control further expansion, it is a serious threat,” claims Kandel.
The risk
Citing similar studies for other diseases in other countries, he further added that the impacts of such meat on human health can pass onto the next generations also. “It seems one mouthful of a ‘buff’ momo that you eat can hit many generations.” He says many people cannot properly identify the causes of their diseases these days, but they fail to notice such petty issues such as where the momo meat comes from.”
File: Momo
Though Kandel says he does not have any specific examples about a malaria-infected buffalo meat causing health risks to humans, he seems convinced given the level of ‘carelessness’ of Nepali people about such issues.
“There are reports of bird flu almost every year in Nepal, but many people do not seem to be bothered about it anyway. The price pf chicken drops as household consumers choose not to eat chicken after such reports,” he says, “But you go to the restaurants in your neighbourhood and you find that chicken momos are equally popular notwithstanding the infection.”
Farmers’ fears
Malaria is apparently a non-communicable disease; there is no way that the cattle can spread it to farmers directly. However, the discovery of malaria in buffalos is a hint that the atmosphere that farmers are living in is prone to the infection and it affects the humans equally, according to the researcher.
Most farmers of Nepal keep their cattle close-by. In many cases, the cowsheds are within the same house that the farmers live in, which is not a problem. “But, you know how the farmers rear the animals?” Kandel explains, “The cowsheds are dirty. The manure is not removed on time. Ultimately, the places of cattle turn out to be hubs for the mosquitoes, the vectors of malaria.”
“The farmers do not care about their own health. How can we expect them to care about the animals and keep the place clean?” he questions before saying, “But, we need to realise that the risks for the animals are also the risks for people.”
On the other hand, malaria kills the cattle untimely or weakens them physically. It causes a huge economic loss to the farmers.

Remedies
The researcher suggests that different measures can be adopted at different levels to address the problems likely to be caused by the malaria parasites in buffalos. “At the domestic level, farmers should pay proper attention to cleanliness and hygiene of the animals. The cattle should be given a regular bath in clean water whereas they also need to stay covered from mosquito bites.”
As no malaria case was found in the wild buffalos during the study, Kandel claims domestic animals are at greater risk, hence improving the way farmers rear the cattle can be a great help.
At the next level, the country needs to improve animal quarantine because the risk of malaria is higher in India than in Nepal. The world’s first case of malaria in a water buffalo was reported in India whereas different recent studies covering Nagpur, Bareilly/Muktesar and Maharashtra have also indicated higher risks. Likewise, other Asian countries such as Vietnam and Thailand also have higher rates of infection, according to Kandel’s report. It is hence significant to tighten the quarantine checking, according to him.
Moreover, other animals might also be suffering from the disease but sufficient research has not been done. Kandel is aware that the sample size of his research was relatively small and should not be generalised to cause terror among farmers and stakeholders. Rather, additional studies should be carried out to determine the severity of malaria in animals of Nepal and plan a coping strategy accordingly, he recommends.",/lifestyle,"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 05:07:58 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/does-your-body-need-potassium.html,"
Potassium? You may have heard about it but cannot precisely put your finger on it.  Physicians advise on taking 3,500 to 4,700 mg of potassium daily. WHO (the World Health Organization), too, recommends an intake of 3,510 mg per day.  Hang on, this does not mean you pop into your mouth a potassium pill every day! Plenty of food is loaded with this mineral compound to help you meet your daily requirements.
Our body to function properly needs diverse nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water. They are essential for the growth of our bone, flesh, organs, and to maintain body metabolism. What’s more, we need them to keep the diseases at bay and retain overall good health. Potassium as a macro-mineral fulfills one of those essential nutrients.
Mineral electrolyte
Electrolytes are essential minerals found in blood, sweat and urine. Minerals such as sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and potassium form the electrolytes much needed by our body.
Imbalance of electrolytes in the body is caused when we lose fluids as a result of persistent vomiting or diarrhea, sweating or fever. Other causes include: Medications such as steroids, diuretics and laxatives.
 Surprisingly, nearly 80% of the potassium is found in our body cells in the form of fluids like blood, sweat, and plasma. The rest is stored in our bones and liver. 
Biomedical scientists explain that potassium, as an agent, on one hand, regulates the fluid balance in our body and on the other controls the electrical activity of the heart and body muscles. In short, it helps the cellular and electrical functions of our body.
Potassium aids our nerves to function, the muscles to contract, maintain a regular heartbeat, pump nutrients into our body cells and chuck waste products out of them. 
As a mineral electrolyte, this wonderful compound cuts down on the high sodium content in our body. It is said to minimize the risk of stroke, high blood pressure, and the formation of kidney stones. It supports cardiovascular health, safeguards muscle mass and preserves the mineral density in our bones.
Potassium deficiency
Surprisingly, the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, USA) in a survey called NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) revealed a mind-boggling fact that in the United States alone a whopping 98 percent of people fail to meet the daily requirement of 3,500 to 4,700 mg of potassium.
Catherine Collins, a dietician at the St George’s Hospital, Tooting London sheds light on potassium by saying, “We use it to help generate an electrical charge which helps the cell function properly. It helps keep your heart rate steady, it helps trigger insulin release from the pancreas to help control blood sugars, and more importantly, keeps blood pressure in check.”
When the potassium level in our blood is low it’s called hypokalemia. The common symptoms of hypokalemia are fatigue, malaise, muscle aches/cramps, digestive disorder, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, irregular palpitation, numbness of body parts and breathing problem, among others.
Severe potassium deficiency occurs when an adult’s potassium level falls below 3.6 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). In such cases, apart from the symptoms mentioned above, others include low blood pressure, paralysis (as a result of muscle weakness) and respiratory failure.  A simple blood test can give you your exact potassium level.

The role of kidneys
While doing the research work for this write-up I met Dr. Rabin Nepali, who kindly shed light on the role of kidneys vis-à-vis potassium. To quote Dr. Rabin: “The dietary intake of potassium ranges from less than 35 to more than 110 mmol/day in U.S. adults.”
“Despite this widespread variation in intake, homeostatic mechanisms serve to maintain plasma potassium precisely between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L. In a healthy individual at steady state, the entire daily intake of potassium is excreted, approximately 90% in the urine and 10% in the stool.”
Dr Rabin Nepali
“More than 98% of total body potassium is intracellular, chiefly in muscle. The rapid exchange of intracellular potassium with extracellular potassium plays a crucial role in maintaining plasma potassium within such a narrow range; this is accomplished by overlapping and synergistic regulation of a number of renal and extra-renal transport pathways.”
“So, kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining a steady state in potassium metabolism, by excreting excess potassium or reabsorbing it as required by the body.” (Dr. Rabin Nepali, DM Nephrology, Asst. Professor, Teaching Hospital, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu).
Food and not supplements
Yes, do not get taken in by supplements although you are tempted. There are one too many that you can buy over the counter.  Go for dietary sources. There is abundant food brimming with potassium. Not processed food, though as they are high in sodium.
Doctors of medicine argue that natural diets rich in potassium is linked with a lower risk of hypertension (high blood pressure), kidney stones and osteoporosis. Our daily food like meat, poultry, fish, fruits, nuts, and vegetables not only pack various nutrients but also serve as an excellent source of potassium.

Beverages such as milk, coffee and other nonalcoholic drinks too contain a liberal amount of potassium. Let’s take a look at the following chart:
Selected Food Sources of Potassium 
Source: https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/
 
Among the foods highest in potassium are said to be beet greens, white beans, soybeans, and Lima beans.

The benefits of potassium include:
Blood pressure and cardiovascular health
Today, hypertension or high blood pressure has become a commonplace health problem among old and young alike. If not addressed on time, it can lead to grave complications like stroke and heart disease.
Sodium or salt, for one, is closely related to high blood pressure and the doctor advises to cut down on the intake of salt. Now, potassium is said to neutralize to a great extent the negative effects of sodium.
Our kidneys aid to keep our blood pressure in control. They put the amount of fluid stored in our body on an even keel. High blood pressure is associated with the increase in fluid in our bodies. Eating a potassium-rich diet negates the effect of sodium and helps the kidneys to restore the balance—as such, lowering the blood pressure to a healthy level.
Clinicians believe a diet high in potassium can help cut systolic blood pressure by more than 10 counts in people with high blood pressure.  
Talking about heart health, according to WHO, 17.9 million people worldwide die of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) that includes coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and others. Four out of five CVD deaths fall under heart attacks and strokes.
WHO recommends an increase in potassium intake from food (not refined food) to reduce blood pressure and cut down the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart disease. Potassium helps reduce vascular calcification, or to simply put it, mineral deposits on the walls of our arteries and veins. These mineral deposits develop into plaques, thus, increasing the risk of stroke and blood clots.
In a study carried out by medical experts, it was found that “those who consumed 4,069 mg of potassium per day had a 49 percent lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease compared with those who consumed about 1,000 mg per day.”
Diabetes
Diabetes has turned into a growing problem. The soaring prevalence of diabetes is also referred to as “the epidemic of the century.” Once considered to be most common with older people, today, affects younger adults too owing to sedentary lifestyle and diet.
According to IDF (International Diabetes Federation), in 2017, the world diabetes figure remained approximately 425 million adults (20-79 years). IDF further stated that by 2045 the figure might rise to a staggering 629 million.
Studies made by health care professionals have come to new findings that lower levels of potassium in the body are also associated with a higher risk of diabetes. 
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at a high risk of ESRD (kidney failure or end-stage renal disease) and CVD (cardiovascular disease), both of which can result in life-threatening complications.
A research made by Dr. Shin-ichi Araki and several of his co-researchers for the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology claimed that diets rich in potassium may help protect the heart and kidney health of patients with type 2 diabetes.
The experiment was participated in by 623 Japanese with type 2 diabetes.  The trial ran from 1996 to 2003 with a median follow-up period of 11 years. The results showed that higher levels of potassium in the participants’ urine showed a lower risk of renal dysfunction and cardiovascular problems.
Bone and muscle maintenance
A diet high in potassium is closely related to bone health. Potassium-rich foods generate alkali in the body to maintain acid-base balance. High intake of protein-rich foods or acidifying foods such as meat, dairy products, and processed cereals creates acidosis in our bodies, which have a negative effect on our bones and muscles.
Metabolic acidosis causes excretion of nitrogen resulting in loss of bone mineral density, and muscle wasting. On the other hand, potassium-dense food like vegetables and fruits helps neutralize the adverse effects of acidosis build-up in our body. Older people, too, are benefitted by eating potassium-rich food like fruits and vegetables, which preserve their muscle mass and enhance bone density as well.
Caveat
The intake of Potassium, as prescribed by a health care professional, is very beneficial to our overall health. Care should be taken, however, not to exceed the recommended dose of 4,700mg per day.
Individuals with no health problems may easily rid their bodies off the excess amounts through their urine with no adverse effects. Food-related potassium toxicity is considered a rarity but excessive consumption can lead to a complication called hyperkalemia. Our body cannot do without potassium. But it does not need it in excess. The kidneys come to the rescue and reject the unwanted potassium from the blood.
In the case of kidney disease, excess potassium can prove dangerous as the kidneys fail to remove the extra potassium, which stays in the blood cells. This can have grave results, even life-threatening ones and the condition is called hyperkalemia.
All health care providers always advise against an extremely high intake of potassium, especially in such patients who have dysfunctional kidney problems and are on supplements. Potassium levels between 5.1 and 6.0 mmol/L are considered high and need immediate consultation. Levels higher than 6.0 mmol/L are dangerous.
Beetroot
Bottom line
Diet and not supplements are the best source of potassium to meet your body’s requirement. “Let food be thy medicine, and let medicine be thy food.” Those words were said by the ancient Greek founder of western medicine, Hippocrates of Kos, during the Greek Classical Period in the 5th century BC.
No truer words have ever been said, which sounds right to this day. Eat right, stay healthy!

The 2015 constitution mentions 13 constitutional commissions with significant roles and responsibilities. However, as of now, only two of them are in full shape. Three of the commissions are totally vacant whereas the rest eight are incomplete and waiting for the government to appoint the officials.
Only the National Human Rights Commission and Public Service Commission have the members in the required numbers as provisioned in the constitution. The National Women Commission, National Dalit Commission and Indigenous Nationalities Commission do not have any officials.
Meanwhile, the Madheshi Commission, Tharu Commission and Muslim Commission have their chairpersons only. Four positions of members in each of the commissions are vacant.
Consequently, the commissions have failed to carry out their responsibilities. “The government has given us the job, but we feel like we are a head without the body,” a chair of one of the three commission says.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/slugging-it-out-on-two-wheels-the-langtang-ride-i.html,"There is nothing like taking a holiday break, to escape the daily grind, the urban chaos, the stifling greenhouse gases, and to say the least to raise your spirits, down in the dumps. Some even like to inject a dose of adventure, too, into such escapades.
For some, it’s just plain sightseeing tours to new places, a pilgrimage or cities. But some are wired differently. Their reading of an adventure is to go off the beaten track, discover the wild and the wacky—something new, fresh, if not, the funkiest. Some even dare to push borders and boundaries.
I happened to know one such swashbuckling duo, Khashing Rai and Shishir Joshi. In 2018, they dared to redefine the concept of conventional trekking by walking bare feet for four consecutive days to Budhinandha Tal, far-west Nepal, Bajura (read the story) to an elevation of 4,600 m with nothing more than Wai Wai (noodles) and chiura (beaten rice) for food, and no warmth of a bed since the deserted trail had no teahouses or lodges. Brave? I thought they were raving mad.
Kyanjin Gompa
Destination Langtang
In 2019, with the Dashain festival around the corner, the duo planned a trip, on wheels (mountain bikes), to the Langtang Valley, which also happens to be a popular trekking destination. Well, in other words, their destination was “the land of the ox.” In Tibetan dialect, ‘Lang’ stands for land, and ‘tang’ translates to an ox.
The valley is also well known for spectacular views of glaciers and needless to write, peerless pastoral beauty. They’d set their sights on Kyangjin Gompa (4,300 m), nestled at the footholds of the iconic peak, the Langtang Lirung. The trip this time did not sound far-out, but it was no picnic.
The gang
The monsoon had not fully dissipated as it came late last year, but that did not matter. The trip was set in stone. The duo this time was to be accompanied by an old compadre Diwash Pradhan and two lady friends,  Anamika Ghothane (Gurung) and Rojisha Limbu, both in their early twenties. Diwash and Khashing had done a ride with me to Upper Mustang in October 2018.
Anamica and Rojisha are registered nurses by profession. Although they have been riding their mountain bikes for the last four years, this was their first-ever tough ride on a gnarly terrain that included rocks, washouts, ruts, loose sand, loose gravel, steep slopes, and impossible inclines. What’s more, the trip included more than 40 percent lugging on extreme inclines, and steep gradients.
Khashing, as the team leader, had briefed every member of the team of the possible hardships and also warned them, especially the women, about the shouldering the bikes. Anamica and Rojisha appeared resolute. They did not even bat an eyelid when Khashing put in the bare facts. Tough as old boots, Shishir did not care. Diwash, not used to technical riding, seemed a little uncertain. “What of it, if the ladies can do it, why can’t I?” he mused.
As it turned out, Shishir changed his mind at the last hour. He said he’d trek instead. Very like him, always unpredictable. He wanted to explore further to the Gan Jala Pass (5,300 m). Coincidentally, the cycling route the group was doing from Syabru Besi to Kyanjin Gompa was the same. The route went further from the gompa to highlands like Tserko Ri and finally the Gan Jala Pass, a key trekking destination in the Langtang region.
Shishir decided he’d tag along with his cycling comrades on foot, help the ladies out on tough sections, and then part company after Kyanjin Gompa. Sounded very out of the ordinary, but not unlike Shishir, though. Catching up with the cyclists for him was a breeze as the terrain was virtually grueling uphill, and the push-and-carry made the ride nothing short of a snail-pace.
To Syabru Besi
After month-long planning, the group finally left for Syabru Besi (also Syaphru Besi) in the second week of September 2019. The trip was scheduled for a week. The buses to Shyabru Besi had changed the usual route from Jhor or Kakani to the Galchhi-Devighat highway (as both the old highways were in bad shape). The road after Galchhi (a point of Prithvi Highway), went along the Trishuli River to Nuwakot with Devighat en-route.
The scheduled buses shuttled the travellers from Machhapokhari, Balaju Bypass. For the first-timer, the bus park can be a nasty surprise to watch the chaotic fuss.
Khashing looked worried that the bumpy ride might ruin the bicycles loaded on the roof of the bus. It reminded him of the Upper Mustang trip mishap when one of the bicycles had a tyre slashed open by some sharp object on the bus-roof.
 

He made it a point to keep checking as the bus stopped at Thade Dhunche, and Thulo Barkhu until they finally arrived at the kick-off point of their trip, Syabru Besi (2,380 m), Rasuwa district.
Layover
As the small but busy town nestled at the base of soaring hills on three sides, the Bhote Koshi tumbled down by its side, making quite a rumble. Mostly hotels and teashops lined the main bazaar. To their surprise, the crowd happened to include more backpack toting foreign tourists, milling around the street, than the locals. After checking into a roadside lodge and a little refreshment, the gang took a stroll along the street.

By and by,  at a  tea stall, over a cup of tea, they overheard a fellow talking about a hot spring very close to the lodge, they’d put up. They decided to have a look-see.  It took them hardly a half-an-hour to get to the spot, located at the confluence of the Langtang Khola and the Bhote Koshi. But nobody relished the idea of taking a dip as the water looked sullied.
At the hot spring, Shyabru Besi. Looks the guys are pointing at Khashing up to some pranks.
 
To Sherpa Gaun
After a layover at the lodge, the group warmed up for the ride the next morning. The destination for the day was Sherpa Gaun, nine kilometres away. Yes, everybody looked excited, Anamica and Rojisha the most. They just could not wait to hop on to their saddles. If Khashing appeared engrossed as the skipper, Diwash seemed a little apprehensive. Shishir remained cool as a cucumber. He gave the ladies a tip or two about the proper handling of the bike on rough trails.
Sherpa Gaun from a distance
As it turned out, the dirt track was not easy sailing. A recent landslip seemed to have strewn the track with rocky debris.
Howzat! Khashing flirting with the camera with one of his jocular stances.
It was time to stop for breakfast. The group chose a teahouse by the bank of the Langtang River.  As the turquoise water tumbled south over rocks and boulders creating white feathers, the fast current formed foam-lipped eddies near the banks. The opposite bank rose to lush towering hills.
So far, so good. No hitch-ups, up until then. Everybody did their best. Shishir did well to keep pace on foot. The lunch was scheduled for Khangjim. After a filling breakfast, a little breather, and having feasted on the pristine landscape, the group stretched themselves up to hop onto their saddles.
The bicycles take a break as the group members grab their breakfast
 After breaking a sweat for something like three hours, they sighted a small habitation, the pit stop for lunch. “That’s Khangjim,” announced Khashing. Time for lunch. Everybody went for the cherished dal-bhat. That reminds me of my 12-day cycling tour to the Upper Mustang when the all-time favourite for our group for lunch was dal-bhat, each day, hands down. Dal-bhat was a reasonable Rs 150.00 (veg). Non-veg was Rs 200.00. “The charges here for lunch is much cheaper than what we paid in Mustang, guys,” commented Diwash, looking a little surprised.
A brief respite
After a brief respite, the group was all set to spin. “On to Sherpa Gaun, our stopover for the day, guys,” called out Khashing. The expected time of arrival at Sherpa Gaun was nearly three hours away. Most of the tracks were rideable but going uphill. The lush vegetation gradually was being replaced by bare hills and scrubland as they gained elevation. The weather remained clear and the air cool with a hint of chill.
Flora and fauna
Langtang National Park is known for a rich and biodiverse flora and fauna. It records more than 1,000 species of vegetation with quite a number of endemic ones. To name a few, the forest is home to sal (Shorea robusta), chirpine ((Pinus roxburghii), Nepalese alder, silver fir, hemlock, and the most common rhododendron. An abundance of birch in Kyangjin, pines in Thulo Syabru and rhododendron mixed forest at Thadepati are noteworthy. The vegetation gradually shifts with the change in the altitude.
The park is equally rich in fauna such as musk deer, Himalayan tahr, Himalayan black bear, serow, the elusive snow leopard (still at a risk status), and, by far, the endangered, red panda. The park is also home to more than 250 species of birds including the Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus), the national bird of Nepal, and satyr tragopan (Tragopan satyra).
Rojisha on a plank crossing
Sherpa Gaun
After pedaling close to three hours on the hill section with a little pushing and occasional carrying on the rocky track, the group arrived at Sherpa Gaun (2,500 m). Surprisingly, Anamica and Rojisha both kept pace with their male partners. Dead beat, the group checked into a lodge for the night. Room tariff again was modestly priced, just Rs 300.00.
Less than a couple of decades ago, Sherpa Gaun was just a scattered hamlet on the hillside, so common about our far-flung regions, living on agriculture—growing potatoes, corn, wheat and barley and doing cattle farming—rearing cows, chickens, goats, sheep including mules and yaks.
Most of the residents of the village are said to have migrated from Tibet, some 600 years ago.  The border is close to the village. By and large, the residents of the village follow Buddhism. The name, Sherpa Gaun, sounds something like a misnomer, considering the predominance of the Tamang community.
Lugging it uphill
The pastoral scenario gradually changed as Sherpa Gaun became a regular stopover for the trekkers doing the Langtang Valley trek. The locals, besides their farming, supplemented their earnings by running lodges and teahouses.

The sheer remoteness of the place, the raw unsullied environs, the element of suspense, and adventure, the mystical identification with the entirety, and the absolute bliss of nature missed out on all the later trips. None compared with my first. It was the ultimate and unparalleled—period.
For me, the night at the three-tiered cavern in Kuri proved a fitful one. The ground floor had hollowed out enclaves, but the upper landing, where we were bedded down, was open with a huge flat rock, almost measuring the size of a house, precariously balanced in a 40-degree angle over us. It served as the roof.
My imagination seemed to run amuck. I feared that the huge rock overhead might, any time, crash down and turn us into a human sandwich. Although we had the logs blazing, it was bitterly cold.

We got up early the next morning so that we could do the final ascent to Kalinchok located on a towering bluff. It was still dark at six in the morning. While we sipped scalding hot coffee, one of our group, the village bloke, left for the shrubs to relieve himself.
Barely had we finished half of our coffee than we heard a yelling that came from the direction the fellow had gone. Soon, we heard foot-falls and there he was in the half-light of dawn bounding towards us as if there seemed no tomorrow for him. We watched dumbstruck.
His face was an open book. He was panting and shaking, mumbling something incoherently. One of his hands still held his unfastened trousers. He kept on repeating “khyak, khyak, I saw a khyak.” Khyak stands for an apparition.
“Are you sure you saw it? What did it look like,” asked my uncle? He recovered his breath, paused a little, and then blurted it out, “it was eight to nine feet tall, hairy and with blood-shot eyes that bore into me.”
My pulse seemed to race like mad when the fellow gave the portrayal. The description he gave pieced together (as reported by the media then) like the Yeti, the Abominable Snowman—the ‘mysterious hominoid’. News about the Yeti often made the headlines worldwide those days. I started fantasizing about my name making it big in Time magazine with the cover story, “Yeti eventually photographed by a Nepali boy.” The feature-story would also carry my photograph. Oh Boy, that will make me a celebrity,” I mused excitedly.

Boyhood fantasy
We asked the fellow to lead us there. He balked first but yielded reluctantly, though. I grabbed my camera, and we all dashed to the spot. When we arrived at the place, the first light of dawn had broken in with the visibility fair.
I was carrying my dad’s Rolleiflex box camera, considered to be high-end in those days. The funny thing about the camera was that you had to peer down into a screen after flipping open the top cover and not look through the viewfinder at the subject like in modern-day ones. The Rolleiflex box camera is considered an antique today.
The fellow stealthily approached the spot where he supposedly saw the ‘khyak’. We crept behind. I’d my camera at the ready. But for the thick hedge and scrub, we saw nothing. We looked around but with no results. The castle I’d built in the air came crashing down. So much for my dream about the Yeti!
Looking back, it was nothing but my boyhood fantasy. Later, after we were back home in Dolakha, my uncle told me that the poor fellow fell sick and recovered only after he consulted a shaman and sacrificed a stout rooster at the Bhimeswor temple.

Highland
We left the cavern in the first light and began our climb. I was overawed to see the twin-crested butte that loomed above us in the north, which, my uncle announced, was our destination, the Kalinchok shrine. The narrow trail seemed perilous as it fell on its side into sheer drops. One false step could but prove fatal.
Image: Khasing Rai
I was surprised to find my breathing a tad laborious. “That’s because we have crossed the 10,000 feet mark, and this happens to be your first ever hike to so high an elevation,” my uncle explained. I hastened to gulp down a mouthful of sattu and pop in a pod of the raw garlic my grandma had stashed into my bag. After something like an hour, we arrived at a fork.
One path led straight across while the other went up on a narrow incline with stairs dug into the earth. “That’s the exit path,” my cousin informed me, pointing to our right. “We are now close to the shrine, just 200 yards to go,” he enthused.
Within minutes we were climbing the final rungs of a rusted iron ladder. Unlike the later years, the rickety iron ladder had no hand-rails and wobbled too. It doubled as a bridge between the twin buttes. We had to tread cautiously as the gaping chasm that fell into a dark depth stared back at us frighteningly. In all honesty, with no head for heights, I was petrified.
Image: Khasing Rai
The summit
Finally, we were at the crest of the narrow ridge. It took us close to two hours. It was kind of scary at that elevation as no handrails, introduced in the later years, secured the summit around. Neither did the paths, up the entire hike. The early morning thick fog at the top made the vibe eerier as the dark ravines on the sides looked threatening. It was cold, understood because we stood at 12, 605ft (3,842m).
Image: Khasing Rai
A solitary slate-roofed two-story house stood on the former crest. The dilapidated condition and the barred doors and windows spoke of its abandoned status. “That was a living quarter for the pilgrims, but as it was in a rundown state, it is not used anymore, “my uncle informed me.
To my dismay, there was no such thing as a temple housing the idol of a Bhagwati or Kali on the main ridge. The flat clearing, barely measuring 200 square feet, had a legion of tridents of all sizes haphazardly stuck into the ground next to a shallow hollow pit. The pit bore a natural spring enclosed by a small pagoda-style temple a little less than my height (5’-4”).

The devotees offered puja at this pit. A horde of bells, big and small, festooned a pillar next to the temple. The devotees offer tridents to the deity to pay their homage. Some also tender bells. Several unidentifiable stone deities lined the center of the ridge. “It is said the holy water from the spring drains down into a similar pit at the Bhimeswor shrine in Dolakha,” my uncle explained. I listened overawed.

My jaws dropped as I looked around. The clock seemed to stop—a “temporal illusion”? I was thrilled to see the majestic Gauri Shankar unfold right before my eyes in the east, as it were, gazing intently at me. A wisp of cloud caressed the snowy tips making me almost jump in a bout of euphoria, given that, it was my first ever hike to such great heights and the rarest rendezvous with the mighty snow-clad peaks.
Peaks galore
Craggy peaks ran the show in the north with the likes of Choba Bhamaré (5,933 m), Langtang Lirung (7,227 m), Dorjee Lakpa (6,966m), Shisha Panga (8,013m), Jugal (6,070m), Manasalu (8,156m), Ganesh I(Yangra,7,422m), Amabamori, Namburi, and many more. The lush hills in the south unfolded into an uninterrupted chain. I just could not believe my eyes, every which way I looked. I could barely contain myself at seeing such unparalleled grandeur and biodiversity.
My cousin informed me that the Kalinchok crest at night time also afforded a view of Kathmandu Valley illuminated at night. I spotted a foot-trailway down northwest, which meandered past a ridge and disappeared. “That,” my uncle explained, “led to Kuti, a village in ancient Tibet. It used to serve long ago as a busy route frequented by ancient traders.” He further informed me, “If the west escarpment of Kalinchok is the source of the Sun Kosi River, the eastern slope gives birth to Tama Koshi. The two rivers meet at Sindhuli.”
After puja (worship) over and an hour at the crest, we decided to leave. As we began our descent, I sighted a gang of shy red-billed choughs sunbathing on a ledge call out. Maybe that was to warn us not to hang around at the shrine longer, I thought. I visited Kalinchok, several times in my later years, on foot and by motor transport. My last trip, in 2014, was on my mountain bike.

 
In all those 50 years, the scenario has undergone no end of changes. The sheer remoteness of the place, the raw unsullied environs, the element of suspense and adventure, the mystical identification with the entirety, and the absolute bliss of nature, missed out on all the later trips. None compared with my first. It was the ultimate and unparalleled—period.
Lost and forgotten
I wonder if the ancient trail to Kalinchok still exists today. The presence of chortens (stupas), cairns, and the stone steles engraved with Tibetan inscriptions commemorating the departed souls in the middle of nowhere. The deathly still Simpani with the picture-perfect emerald green heart-shaped pond hemmed in by the tall pines.
The sightings of the danfé ((Lophophorus impejanus), or the Impeyan monal on high ridges, basking in the early morning sun; the Yaks attended by cows (chouris) roaming freely on the wild meadows and the woods. The sweet, invigorating Chhang (sweet corn wine) after the grueling climb at Thangsa, the sautéed dried yak meat with farm-fresh milk and soft chhurpi at Gairi, served by those smiling Sherpa ladies, who did not want to be paid–all seem but fond memories, nay a dream.
To say the least, how can I fail to recall the soul-searching experience I’d at the Dharmadwar (holy entrance)? The local myth ran that, by the will of God, only the devout could squeeze through the narrow slit between two huge rocks that made the Dharmadwar. It was said, the sinners always failed, no matter their size. I feel like guffawing today when I recall the incident. Even though I was a scrawny fellow then, my heart pounded when I underwent the trial (ordeal?).
Looking back, every wonderful moment I spent on the great wilderness trodding on the ancient trail to Kalinchok, as a youngster, seems a figment of my imagination—lost to the sands of time. Curiously, though, after 50 years yet, they still haunt my memories with a smack of nostalgia to this day.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-ancient-trail-to-kalinchok-memoir-i.html,"I journeyed to Kalinchok several times but none compared with the one I did the first time, which, today, has become little short of a memoir.
Consecrated to Goddess Bhagwati Kali, Kalinchok, the Hindu shrine nestles on a soaring bluff 12, 605ft (3,842m) above the sea level. Regarded a holy pilgrimage, the deity hugs a narrow ridge that sharply falls to deep ravines. Lush rolling hills punctuate the southern horizon in an unbroken chain as far as the eyes can travel.
If the north skyline parades an array of snow-capped peaks, the east on the other, towers with the sacred twin-peaked the Gaurishankar (7,134m) and the Melungtse Himal (7,181m).
The early days
Some half a century ago, Kalinchok seemed off-limits to the rest of Nepal. Just the locals of Dolakha, Charikot, and people from nearby villages visited the highland destination to pay their homage. The reason was not far to seek—lack of communication—roads. Dolakha and Charikot were not accessible by road and still fell short of electricity then.

Further, during those days, the foot-trail from Charikot to Kalinchok was no picnic. The narrow trail cut through rugged terrain and climbed steeply for hours on end. The paths were narrow, slippery, and without footholds at no end of places. The switchbacks that cut through the thick forest often vanished into overgrown shrubs. More often than not, people lost their way.
Only clusters of tiny villages lay in the first half of the journey, the rest of the route remained virtually deserted, harsh, cold and unrelenting—nay near frightening. The highlands bore only a handful of shacks belonging to the Sherpa community.
The weather, too, in those heights took a nasty shift at times, and even months like February and March caught hailstones the size of golf balls. At such times, the pilgrims had to face grave danger, as an adequate shelter was difficult to find. What’s more, local gossips ran high that wayfarers were often looted in the dense forest that intercepted the trail.
Arrival of roads
With the arrival of the Swiss-engineered Lamosanghu-Jiri Road (Pasang Lhamu Rajmarg) in 1985, connecting Charikot and later the dirt road from Charikot to Kuri in 2005, the destination gradually drew more visitors from far and wide including Kathmandu. Most comprised of pilgrims. Others included adventure lovers and odd foreign tourists.
Charikot, 133km northeast of Kathmandu can be reached today by bus. To access the burgeoning town of Charikot, the first leg of the journey takes a four-hour bus ride on the Arniko Highway to Khadi Chaur, Lamo Sanghu. The highway there meets a fork that, after crossing a steel bridge over the Bhote Koshi, follows a narrower feeder road on the right (road to Jiri or Pasang Lhamu Rajmarg), which goes to Charikot. From Khadi Chaur, it takes another two hours to Charikot.
From Charikot, it’s like 18km to Kuri. You can either hire or share with others a Bolero jeep. After Kuri, it’s a one and a half-hour walk up a steep hill with stone steps to climb. A year ago, a cable-car service opened to shuttle the pilgrims to Kalinchok from Kuri.
Shrouded in mystery
For ages, village folklore and myths abounded the Kalinchok shrine. A mere mention of the deity evoked emotions of awe, dread, and reverence among the native inhabitants of the hill-town Dolakha and nearby villages.

I still recall the words of my mother, a nonagenarian, aged 94 today, when I visited Kalinchok the first time. That was almost 48 years ago. “You better keep those things on your mind. First, do not attempt the shrine the wrong way. There are two approaches—one to gain admittance and the other to exit. The exit comes first but skip that and go a little further to follow the path that climbs to a steel footbridge.”
“Do not,” she continued, “hang around long after the puja. The shrine is visited by all kinds of spirits, some good others evil. Last but not least, do not at any cost return to the shrine after you exit the flight of steps down. You will meet with dire consequences if you do that,” she finished with an admonishing wave of her hand.
She went on to relate the incident when a local villager, disregarding the local belief, went back to collect something he’d left at the deity site. The fellow threw up blood and died after he was back home. That tale gave me the goosebumps.

The old days
I was a strapping youngster, just through with his SLC exams and a freshman at college, when I did my first hike to Kalinchok. I must have been 18 years old then (I’m 67 now). I was visiting my ancestral home in Dolakha for the first time with an uncle. The present Pasang Lhamu Highway was not built at the time. First, I travelled by bus on the Arniko Highway to a roadside town called Barhabishe, located at the banks of the Bhote Koshi River.
From Barhabise, the onwards journey to Dolakha began on foot, a gruelling hike that took a day and a half. The trail traversed across several villages but mostly forested areas crossed our path. We barely ran into wayfarers as the trail seemed deserted with no sign of habitation. We met people only when we neared small settlements.
There were no lodges and teahouses all along the route at the time. So, we had to spend the night in a village. For accommodation, we approached the nearest house and asked the owner. Amusingly, meals for the night depended largely on the owner’s hospitality.
After a day and one night on the trail, we finally arrived at Charikot at around 10 in the morning. “We’re almost home, it’s just four and a half kilometers from here,” announced my uncle. I could not wait to see my hometown.
Dolakha
Unlike Charikot, which happened to be just a cluster of thatched hamlets scattered around the hillside, Dolakha looked flourishing. The village, though small, boasted several shops and a school. As cobbled paths crisscrossed the town, stone spigots seemed to be located on every street. What struck me the most was the presence of Hindu temples and monuments in quite a number. I even saw a Buddhist stupa into the bargain.
I further learned that Dolakha served once as a flourishing Kingdom ruled by the Malla Kings. Little wonder, the modest little village seemed steeped in rich culture and history. The jewel in the crown, the Bhimeswor Shrine, the most revered deity of the Dolakhes, was regarded as the pride and glory of Dolakha. Its fame traveled far and wide and drew devotees by the thousands.
The local people of Dolakha claim that the stone deity at the Bhimeswor shrine perspires preceding any grave national catastrophe befalling the country. Despite repeated wiping, beads of sweat kept trickling down the stone effigy of Bhimeswor prior to the following: the devastating earthquake of 1934 (2007 B.S.), the demise of Panchayat government in 1990, the Royal carnage of June 1, 2001, at the Naryanhity Palace, to cite a few.

The ancient trail
After a few days stay at my ancestral home in Dolakha, we were all set to begin the trek, the trail trodden by my ancestors. My anxious grandma hastened to shove into my bag pods of raw garlic and sattu (finely-ground dry-roasted corn), urging me to munch on them when reaching the uplands. “That works against ‘lekh-lagné,” she said.
Lekh lagné translates to altitude sickness. Eating raw garlic and sattu when going to the highlands was a common practice in Dolakha. We hit the trail with my uncle, a cousin from Dolakha, and one village bloke. The first leg of the journey was to Charikot, four and a half kilometers west of Dolakha.
Farming and rearing goats and chickens seemed the distinguishing feature of the village. As we left the settlements behind, the trail led uphill through patches of terraced fields with rice, millet, and mustard. The rice fields were green with tender stalks, waist-high. Other patches had flowering mustard. The hillside seemed to stand out amidst the contrasting colours.

Groves of bamboo along the trails were a common sight. Over our shoulders to the south, we could see the receding Charikot drop steeply into unbroken terraces of lush rice fields cascading down to the Tama Koshi River that wound its way across a deep gorge.

After we passed by a cluster of thatched huts at a village called Chhotang, the landscape took a shift. The trail wound up with occasional settlements that crossed our path, but gradually dropped in number as it led across uninhabited terrain and lush woods.
As I laboured on the trail on the inclines, my city mind strayed to the thought that our far-off country locales could be so quiet and remote. The dense cover we intercepted held, temperate to sub-alpine mixed coniferous and deciduous forest, largely blue pine, hemlock, oak, and the ubiquitous rhododendron( Laligurans) and Chimal (white rhododendron).

The inimitable Sherpas
After a few hours on the remote uphill, we were relieved to see some sign of life. It was a small Sherpa hamlet called Gairi Gaon (2,450m). It consisted of just three shacks. If the north commanded a panoply of peaks in the distance, the mighty-looking Gauri Shankar stood right before our eyes in the east. There was a considerable chill in the weather.

The smiling Sherpas were very generous and offered us something to eat. The food included dried yak meat, boiled potatoes (their staple), and the local delicacy, chhurpi (hard cheese made from yak-cow or Chauri milk). Freshly made and soft, the cheese was very appetizing.
The Sherpa ladies were reluctant to accept the money my uncle offered for their hospitality but accepted coyly as we insisted. After Gairi, the higher we climbed, the outback seemed further isolated and wilder.
“After Gairi, the trail will be isolated all the way, no habitation, nothing to eat. So, expect nothing,” my uncle said with a smile. Very young as I was, and had never traveled out of the Valley, every moment, since I started for my ancestral home, was a one of its kind. When we stopped for brief respites, I munched on the dry-roasted soybean and maize my grandma had wrapped in a piece of rag and stowed into my bag. It surely worked when I felt the pangs of hunger.
The more we climbed, the harder the trail got as dense shrubs seemed to come in the way. Some even stung as they had sharp spikes. Many a time, I could not help feeling that we were lost. As we climbed further, the pristine backwoods teemed with tall pines in thick rows, which seemed to reach for the skies. No mortals around. Total serenity, complete solitude! Sheer bliss!
In one of my later hikes more than two decades later, the same stretch of the jungle was, to my horror, strewn with logs, many freshly felled, and the old left to decay. It looked the unscrupulous loggers had gone on a rampage. Some of the stumps measured close to three feet in girth. Later, I learned that they were more than 100 years old. All I could do was shake my head helplessly.
Kuri
As we slogged up a small clearing, it seemed the excruciating climb had finally ended. The spot was called the Ganesh Twapper. The trail descended into a small valley. “That,” announced my beaming cousin, “is Kuri, our stop-over for the night.” Darkness fell when we stopped at Kuri.
The meadows were bare of trees. In total darkness, we took shelter for the night in a cave called the teen-tallé-odar (literally a three-tiered cavern). As my uncle and others set about to prepare the evening meal, I lay down spent and starving.
We had to bear everything from home–rice, dal (pulse), vegetables, tea, and needless to say, the pots and pans for cooking. For cooking, we foraged for firewood. At night-time, we found dead logs to burn to fight off the cold. The village bloke had to go quite a distance to fetch them.
Even in early November, the temperature seemed to drop down to below zero at Kuri. For four months, the trail remained closed due to heavy snowfall. “The Sherpas from Gairi, Chothang, and Kuri relocate their dwellings and Yak goths (sheds) to lower climes before the onset of snow each winter,” my uncle explained. He had walked that trail to Kalinchok several times.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-gunfire-pond-why-you-should-visit-timbung-pokhari-in-eastern-nepal-2.html,"
Four days away from Kathmandu lies Timbung Pokhari, a religious pond at an elevation of 4335 m. The pond borders Taplejung’s Sindingwa Rural Municipality and Panchthar’s Yangwarak Rural Municipality.
The name ‘Timbung Pokhari’ originated from a Limbu word ‘Timbak’, which means the firing of a gun. The locals gave the pond this name as the pond often makes a sound that is similar to that of gunfire.

Majestic views of Kanchenjunga can be seen close to the pond which is 466 m in length and 154 m in width.
Even though the pond is covered in snow for six months every year, hosts of pilgrims have been visiting this pond to offer puja for a few centuries now. Pilgrims gather around the pond, especially during the month of Shrawan (July-August) and during festivals like Janai Purnima and Nag Panchami.

It is believed that by offering a puja in this pure pond, wishes of pilgrims come true along with their lives being filled with peace and happiness. But the locals also believe that bad things happen to the visitors if they have sin, greed and jealousy on their conscience.

The locals believe that the magpies around the area clean the pond on a regular basis. They also add that things that are in the pond or are being offered to the pond shouldn’t be taken away. Locals connect the death of 12 foreigners recently with the myth.

The journey from Kathmandu to Timbung Pokhari can take up to four days. If you wish to spend a day at the pond, it will take a total of nine days.
It takes two days on foot to reach Timbung from Chyangthapu, the starting point of Mid-Hill Highway. Due to the unavailability of the road, the only way to reach the pond is walking.

People from different places from Nepal and other countries visit Timbung Pokhari. As the pond is quite close to India’s border, it sees a lot of Indian pilgrims throughout the year from places like Manipur, West Bengal and Sikkim.

The pond is both unique in natural beauty and biodiversity. The area around the pond is home to various rare flora and fauna and is also known as the capital of herbs. Valuable herbs like bikham, kutki, padmachal, jatamasi, panchaule and yarsagumba can be found in the area along with aromatic herbs like sunpati, bhairungpani and sikpale.

The place is also home to animals like Himalayan monal, Himalayan blue sheep, Himalayan goral, bear, snow leopard, musk deer, red panda and many more.
The best time to visit Timbung Pokhari is between March and October. Mid-July to August is even better to get there and witness the unique culture of the area.

Having seen its potential, the local government is now working at promoting the place hosting various fairs in the area. The pond has also been featured on the list of 100 new tourism destinations that the federal government published a few days ago.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/fantastic-phoksundo-a-trip-to-nepals-deepest-lake-2.html,"
Ever since I watched the movie Himalaya (also known as Caravan), I always wanted to go to Dolpa and visit Phoksundo Lake. Having planned this trip more than once, 2018 became the year when I finally got a chance to visit Nepal’s pristine lake.
The way
Dolpa district is now accessible by road, but the easier way to get to the Phoksundo Lake is via air. That is why we took a flight from Nepalgunj to Juphal, from where we started our four-day trek towards the lake.
After the 35-minute flight, we started our trek to Dunai, descending through maize fields and local villages. We walked along the bank of Bheri River and reached Dunai after four hours.
The next day, we were headed to Chhepka. The six-hour trail descends through the streets of Dunai and crosses a bridge over Bheri River. After few kilometres, we reached Shey Phoksundo National Park check post.

From there, we ascended along the rock-strewn trail and trekked further through a series of hemp farms until we reached Kageni. Relishing the views of waterfalls and lush vegetation, we made our way through the tropical forests to reach our overnight stop: Chhepka.
The next overnight stop from Chhepka was the Jharana Hotel which was around six hours away. Ascending through a forested path filled with big cedar trees, we climbed up through wide meadows situated above the gorge of Phoksundo River, from where we get a great view of a high waterfall and a faraway view of Phoksundo Lake.
The five-hour journey from Jharana Hotel to the lake descended steeply through forests filled with birch trees to the upper reaches of the Phoksundo Khola, from where we trekked through the shores of the lake.

The lake
My dream of coming to the lake had come true. What I liked the most about the place was how the water changed colours. It was blue one time and light blue a little later.
Walking around the place, we also got to see a waterfall coming out of the lake. The Phoksundo Waterfall is believed to be Nepal’s biggest waterfall.
We also learned that the lake sees a lot of French tourists.

Facilities for trekkers
The tourists generally stay at Rigmo Village, which has a few tea houses. However, the lodges haven’t been managed well, which has put a dent in the beauty of the lake.
The walking trail to the lake isn’t as great with a lot of trees obstructing the way. Sometimes, it is quite narrow, which makes it quite difficult for tourists to walk. The mules use the same road which results in dirty trails and unhappy trekkers.
The people believe that enough has not been done to promote this area as a tourist destination. The lawmaker representing Dolpa, Satya Pahadi, shares that even though the place’s natural beauty is known to many, it hasn’t been getting enough tourists.
“This lake and the region’s natural beauty should be promoted by Nepal Tourism Board and its stakeholders. It needs to have sufficient infrastructure, which will make it easy for foreigners to come and enjoy the area,” she shares.

She also informs that the road is what most people complain about. “Tourists have nowhere to go after they visit the lake. There are so many areas which lack trail in the area” she explains.

Pahadi adds that a new committee should be formed for the conservation of both the area and the lake.
Dolpa is quite different, in geographical and cultural forms, from other districts in Nepal. It calls for a unique promotion strategy to develop the area to ensure that the tourists will have a value-for-money travel, demand stakeholders.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/four-destinations-to-start-out-mountain-biking-in-kathmandu.html,"
Hey guys, I expect my previous three-story series on mountain biking (mtb in short) has helped you get the hang of the basic bike skills and handling; and you must have pulled off quite some off-road short rides to the backcountry.
Maybe you would now like to try some challenging rides.  Let me help you with a lowdown on some locations for you to venture out, which can really turn out as fascinating daylong destinations.
For a start, the destination I am going to chart out for you is a one-day long ride with a moderate to rugged terrains, both paved and dirt including some isolated forested areas. So my advice to you is: Take along a partner with you–so much the better and more fun if you can muster a group of say three to four riders. That will also help you to learn group rapport and group dynamics.
Not to be missed
Hopefully, you will not miss out on the basic essentials for the trip such as a pump, spare tube, patch kit, a toolkit . . . and of course, a rain jacket.  Don’t!  Also, make sure that you are well-hydrated way before you kick off. What I always do before long rides is to drink a litre of oral electrolyte-blended water at least 5 hours before the start (mostly coinciding with a night before) and supplement it with water during the ride. If you are carrying a hydration bladder tucked into your backpack, all the better.
As you sweat a lot and lose a lot of fluid, you need to replenish yourselves to keep yourself hydrated and avoid getting the most dreaded issue like muscle cramps, which can really ruin your entire ride.  Caveat: do not start on a completely empty stomach. A light breakfast before the ride is a good idea.
“Electrolytes are analogous to the motor oil in your car—they don’t make the engine run, but they’re absolutely necessary to keep everything running smoothly. Proper functioning of the digestive, nervous, cardiac, and muscular systems depends on adequate electrolyte levels” writes Steve Born, a sports nutrition specialist.
It will be a good idea to stash in some energy bars or chocolates into your backpack to refuel yourself as you will be burning off a lot of calories doing quite some gruelling up-hills. Also, they can work wonders for your sapping energy and stamina. Bananas, too, can substitute for the energy bars if you forget to carry them.  Needless to write, carry water bottles. And if you wish to have a less sore bum, apply Vaseline under your crotch. And do not forget to put on your padded underwear.

Nagarkot
Everybody knows about this scenic hill town, and most of you might have visited Nagarkot one time or other in a vehicle of some kind.  Of the many cycling destinations, Nagarkot (2,195 metres) comes first in my priority list for beginners as it combines both a tough climb and a thrilling adrenaline-pumping downhill experience. Apart from that, it offers several off-road back routes, some quite challenging.
Nagarkot
Nagarkot is like 32-33 km from Kathmandu with Bhaktapur en route. The road is paved all the way.   After crossing the Bhaktapur Bazaar, you have to hit the road to Kharipati. After that, the paved road starts climbing and continues all the way up to Nagarkot. Owing to the recent widening work underway, do not expect it to be a smooth paved ride. The uneven road, gravelly at places, can almost pass for an off-road–so much the better for an mtb rider!
Given the relentless uphill, as a first-timer, it might take you a little over four hours from Kathmandu to Nagarkot including brief respites for a breather and some refreshments; plenty of tea houses line the road. Start early, around seven or eight in the morning, if you want to have lunch at Nagarkot and get back home before dark. Lots of eateries there serve dal-bhat and being a touristy place, also other dishes like pasta, noodles, pizza, whatever you fancy.
From Nagarkot Bazaar, you can ride to the View Tower situated 3.5 km up on a slight hill. You can take a 360-degree panoramic image of the sprawling Himalayas including the Everest if the weather permits and you are armed with a telephoto zoom lens.
The return ride from Nagarkot the same way back will be a half hour to one hour faster since you will be free-wheeling down all the way from Nagarkot to Bhaktapur. Round trip back to Ktm: 64-65 km.
2.
Nagarkot-Changu-Bhaktapur
Changunarayan
For the return ride, there are several other options to choose from. First, you can take the Nagarkot- Telkot-Changu Narayan-Bhaktapur (10 km approx.) route which also offers an off-road motor track. After some 3.5 km backtracking from Nagarkot to Telkot junction, you come to a cross-section.
Take the road that goes to Changu. Better ask around, if you get confused about the correct direction. As you ride the Telkot gravelled road towards Changu (6.5km), you come to a fork, the track down goes to Bhaktapur while the one that goes straight heads towards the Changu Narayan shrine.
Said to be more than 3,000 years old and designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Changu Narayan shrine is well worth a visit.  There are two options going back to Bhaktapur:  either you take the paved road or backtrack to the fork you passed earlier and hit the Telkot-Duwakot-Jhaukhel off-road track.  The track crosses the forested Telkot hill down to Bhaktapur past small settlements on the way. Either way, the round trip to Kathmandu will be something like 66-67 km.
3.
Nagarkot-Kattike Bhanjhyang-Shali Nadi-Sankhu- Ktm    
Sali Nadi during Swasthani Brata
                                        
Beginners, you will be thrilled to your bones if you hit this trail–a most rewarding experience if you love downhilling. Rugged and challenging this trail will really put your skill to the test. Downhill all the way from Nagarkot, the jeep track is lined by a thick forest until you reach Kattike Bhanjhyang (9 km).
The ride from Kattike, a small settlement, to Shali Nadi, Sankhu (8km) is again all the way down with a section of stone-laden path with steep descents. You have to be extra careful on this bumpy downhill section. The trail crosses isolated forested hills and then gradually opens up to a beautiful countryside as you reach Shali Nadi, another famous Hindu shrine which hosts an annual festival in the month of Magh (January-February).
After Shali Nadi you enter the town of Sankhu also called Shankharapur, said to have been named so for its conch-shell shape. From Sankhu it’s 23 km to Kathmandu or two and a half hours ride. The round trip back home is like 72-73 km.
4.
Nagarkot-Kattike-Jarshing Pauwa-Sankhu-Ktm

This is a little longer route than the rest. From Nagarkot, you descend down to Kattike like you do for Shali Nadi.  You will meet a fork at Kattike. The road to your left goes to Shali Nadi. To head towards Jarshing Pauwa, you have to go straight (4 km) up.  After Kattike, the dirt road starts climbing cutting across small village settlements, forested area, and terraced fields that slope down in a steep drop. If you are lucky, you can see a sweeping view of the snow-capped mountains to your north.
The ride from Kattike to Jarshing Pauwa is like one and a half hours with mostly ascents, some really steep ones.  The elevation of Jarshing Pauwa is 1803 metres. The small village perched on an open hill boasts some good tea houses and a few resorts.
From Jarshinga Pauwa, you are met with a wide paved road that snakes all the way down through a beautiful forest to Lapsephedi and the Sankhu Bazaar (7.5 km).  Round trip to Ktm: 76-77km.
All things considered, the Nagarkot ride promises the beginners a truly thrill-packed getaway, whichever route they chose to ride back–the rides are tough, scenic, educative, challenging–all rolled into one! Caveat: For beginners, this ride can be really tough and gruelling and you might be nursing sore muscles the next day. But it is worth its weight in gold–a most rewarding experience indeed.
Take frequent breaks, soak in the beauty and the ambience of your surroundings, chat with the local people, capture the memorable moments into your camera . . . and do not forget to have that special sweet tea made from buffalo milk at a village tea shop–always my favourite when riding through the country!
Next, I will bring you more such ride info on short, day-long and some longer with night halts. Until then, ride safe and keep the rubber side down!

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-buried-kingdom-of-simraungadh.html,"
In 2012, I visited Simraungadh, a quintessential Terai town, some 160 km south of Kathmandu. The trip was not planned but a last-minute decision—no more than one of my little quirks. But, much to my astonishment, it turned out the little-known town once prided as a thriving capital city of Mithila kingdom in the 11th century Karnata Dynasty.
After rounding off our pilgrimage to the Gadhimai, a Hindu shrine 20 km northeast of the border city Birgunj, I suggested my wife, Radhika, we pay a visit to Simraungadh, 13 km away. The whole idea of the sudden foray was to dig for clues to my ancestral roots, the early Dolakhes, the people of Dolakha, a hill-town 143 km northeast of Kathmandu.
To Radhika, my idea founded on hearsay (talked about by elders in Dolakha) sounded nothing short of a wild-goose chase. With the puja ritual wrapped up at Gadhimai (the Hindu shrine is also noted for holding the largest animal sacrifice in the world every five years), we drove off to Simraungadh.
Dismal start                                                                                                    
We were in for some bad vibes, however. We met a local who told us that only a week ago, a fellow was found murdered on the road to Simraungadh. Another fanned the flames by quipping in that the road cut across some isolated forest stretches was frequented by Indian dacoits.  That gave Radhika quite a fright. I thought the inside stories were a trifle exaggerated, if not just gossip. I managed to get her acquiescence reluctantly, though. There were three of us, Radhika, a priest from Gadhimai who kindly volunteered to guide us, and I. I was behind the wheel of our Hyundai Getz.
Our progress on the badly pitted road was slow, almost a crawl at some places. Some sections of the dirt road required weaseling out of a lot of potholes. All this time, as we sped past deserted locales and wooded stretches, an edgy Radhika kept on casting suspicious looks outside the window.
As we drove along, vast swathes of harvest-ready rice fields flanked the road with thin habitation and insignificant motor traffic—all the more reason for Radhika to get worked-up. All we intercepted, less than halfway, was a solitary bullock-cart lurching along the uneven road with gunny sacks piled high.
The archetypal Terai
Radhika sighed in relief as a few motorbikes and trucks passed by kicking up clouds of dust. Soon, we cruised past small shanty settlements with thatched-roofed mud house, some tiled—the kind so typical about the Terai. We saw men and women going about their ways, some walked, others rode bicycles. The most common sight included women ambling along the side of the road with some kind of a load balanced on their covered heads. Curiously, most of the women, old and young alike, wore white dhotis sans blouses.
As we drove on, I noticed roadside clapboard shops on stilts selling all and sundry but with hardly any customer. Mango groves, Jamun (Indian blueberry), and coconut trees dotted the distant fields. The entire landscape gave a sleepy and deserted look.
Everyone gave a curious look at our passing car, even domestic cattle. While people stopped to look, stray cows, buffaloes, and goats turned their heads at us wide-eyed. Some even spooked.   Excited children ran along the side of the car. Pariah dogs gave a chase barking furiously.
The smell that wafted through our car windows was distinct– burning leaves and the dung-cakes. A strong pungent smell of molasses, at times, stung our nostrils. There was no mistaking the Terai!  Those outer reaches seemed to be under a spell in a timeless past, inching away at its own pace, untouched or undisturbed by the urban boom.
Unusual traffic
After an hour’s dusty ride, we finally arrived in Simraungadh. Nothing looked new, no different from another of those dreary impoverished village towns you see in the terai. The town area boasted a little modernity with crummy tea-houses and shops lining the streets. Modern brick houses and mud hamlets, however, seemed grossly at odds as they huddled together back-to-back.

Squalor and poverty lay behind the town’s incongruous modern façade. The main bazaar bustled with life. Bicycles, rickshaws, motorbikes, tractors, bullock carts, stray animals and occasional tangas (horse-carts) made up the traffic. People milled around amid blaring music belting out Hindi film tunes. Dust and filth appeared all around. Chaos!
After parking our car, we looked around for some help. We wanted to find people who might know about the Dolakhes. I intercepted an elderly dhoti-clad gentleman and asked him. After a quizzical long look at us, he suggested in his broken Nepali we try the main bazaar chowk (square).

Disappointment
In that part of the Terai, the predominant language was Maithili and Bhojpuri. People seemed uncomfortable at speaking Nepali. At the main bazaar, we approached a young fellow in jeans. He looked like a student but all we got from him was a shake of his head. A skeptical Radhika suggested trying some shops. We did but to no avail. After an hour of running around, the dust, the din, and the noonday sun took their toll on us. We were sweating hard and exhausted.
Then, a glimmer of hope… A middle-aged fellow we met at the bazaar asked us to try a certain street. Off we went looking. Some 15 minutes later, we found it. Much to our consternation, we met a family there from Gorkha, and not Dolakha. Blast it! Our informant must have got confused by the similar-sounding words.

With fallen faces, we tried everything; we met on our way back. Our efforts seemed futile. It was time to quit, I thought. So much for my ancestor-hunting! We decided to take a look around the village-town, though.
Tour of the town
Lunch at a roadside eatery proved far-out. To our amazement, the food was served on newsprint paper—a tingling spicy mutton curry with bhuja (dry-roasted rice grain) with slices of onion and radish. The garnishing included a wedge of lemon and a green chilly. For me, the lunch proved an ordeal since I was not used to fiery hot food.
Kankali Mai
After lunch, we first visited the Kankali Ishra Mata Shrine. Going by history, it was after 1800 BCE that the Indo-Aryans first started building Hindu temples of worship. The locations they chose were picturesque places. Small wonder: Hindu shrines are found mostly on river banks, hilltops, seashores, by the side of reservoirs, and the like. The Kankali shrine boasted an impressive reservoir on its side, which was said to have been built by King Shiva Singh in the 12th century for his daughter Ishwari Singh. Locals called it the Ishra Pond.
A gaunt bearded fellow, the main priest of the temple, Ram Chandra Das, showed us around the temple site. “Mysteriously, time and again, Goddess Kankali Mai switches her abode to far removed places such as Patna, as Patandevi, to Kolkata as Kali, or Betia, all cities in India’s Bengal and Bihar state,” he said, also shedding light on the myths and legends associated with the deity.
Reservoir at Kankali shrine
The main temple, a nagara (curvilinear) architecture, housed a three-foot-tall black polished idol of Goddess Kankali Mai—an avatar of Kali, the Hindu goddess of enlightenment and liberation. Curiously, it bore an uncanny resemblance to the idol of Gadhidai we saw earlier at Bariyarpur.
Previously known as Kangankali for the Goddess’s fetish for kangans (bangles), the idol heavily draped in a red shawl and adorned with shiny golden motif, carried the same height and build of Gadhimai.
The idol stood under the extended hood of the mythological Shesh Nag, the thousand-headed cobra. According to Hindu mythology, the Shesh Nag symbolises ‘eternity’ and holds the entire universe on its head. The most striking likeness between the idol at Gadhimai and the Kankali Mai was the large protruding eyes cast in silver.
Only the saffron cloth that draped the Shesh Nag seemed to distinguish them apart. Our guide told us that Gadhimai was an incarnation or avatar of none other than the Kankali Mai.

Next to the shrine stood a 700-year-old domed building with a steeple. Its inner sanctum housed the samadhi (tomb) of Mansha Baba, a revered baba, or saint, who was said to have miraculously entered the earth by his divine powers to breathe his last peacefully.

History
Recalling Nepal’s medieval history, Simraungadh was the capital city of Mithila kingdom (also called Tirhut) in 1097 AD. The Mithila region was bounded by the Mahananda River on the east, the Gandaki on the west, the Ganges on the south and the Himalayas on the north, spreading over half of present-day Bihar State, India. Mithila finds its mention in the sacred Hindu epic Ramayana by Valmiki, too.
The Karnataor Samaroon dynasty was founded by the King of Bengal, Nanyadev in the 11th century. He first ruled Mithila. His successors reigned over Mithila for more than two centuries. The regime ended with the 5th successor, Harisimha Deva (1295-1324 CE) following an invasion of Mithila by the Mughal warrior Ghias-Ud-din Mohammad Bin Tughlak in 1324-25.
Simraungadh was razed to the ground following the siege. King Harsimha Dev and his family fled north into the hills and remained in hiding. Then, with his entourage, he left for Dolakha but died on the way at a place called Tinpata in Sindhuli. There are no two opinions about Harisimha Dev’s flight. Both Nepal and Mithila vaṃśāvalis (genealogies) support it.
However, speculations run high over Harisimha Dev’s post-flight period, and it is the issue much debated amid historians. Some claim King Harisimha Deva, under a refugee status, entered the Nepal Valley (also called Nepal Mandala—Bhadgaon, Kantipur and Lalitpur) around the beginning of the 14th century. Others maintain that he even ruled the Nepal Valley.
The inscription erected at Hanumandhoka by King Pratap Malla (1641-1674 AD) illustrates how Harisimha Dev came to Ashmanagar (Panauti), and then to Nepal Valley. A similar account by Pratap Malla is also to be found at the Pashupatinath inscription. History pages also mention that the Tulaja Bhawani deity was brought to Nepal Valley by Harisimha Dev from Simraungadh. The Malla Kings came to adopt and revere it as their tutelary deity.

Ranibas
Our last visit included the Ranibas, the residence (bas) of the queen (rani).The palace was built by the Karnata King Shiva Singh in the 12th century for his daughter Queen Isri Devi. The site later came to be converted into a Ram-Janaki Hindu shrine.
Ram Mandir
History records that in the 1850s (AD), Prime Minister Jung Bahadur’s son General Jit Jung Rana built the temple in memory of his father. Flanked by thick brush, the narrow path that led to the temple opened on to a wide forecourt with a huge gnarled kabhro tree (a kind of fig tree that bears wild fruit used for making pickle). A mango orchard lay next to it.
A flight of steps led to the entrance of a square, two-storied tin-roofed brick structure—said to be the living quarters that surrounded the temple premises. Closely similar to the Kankali temple but much larger and imposing, the two-storied structure was painted in vibrant colors and stood high on a raised platform.
Falling wall of Ram Mandir quarters
The interior of the temple housed idols of Ram, Sita, and Laxman, three of the mythical gods from the Hindu Ramayana epic. They all sat in a row, while statues of Jung Bahadur Rana, his wife, and son Gen. Jagat Jung, knelt before them with folded hands.
Statues of Ram, Laxman and Sita
Two large metallic bells, said to have been added to the shrine by Jagat Jung, bore inscriptions dated BS 1933 (1876 AD). In the foreground of the temple, a big statue of Hanuman, the Hindu monkey God from Ramayana, sat on a raised pedestal. “The shrine attracts a capacity crowd of worshippers every year on the day of Ram Navami (birthday of Lord Ram),” informed a local guy.
The courtyard held an ancient well. Stone relics lay in some disarray at a corner of the courtyard. The living quarters for pilgrims girdling the temple appeared in a pitiably run-down state with the walls falling apart. It was clear the premises were sorely neglected.

A pond, said to belong to the olden days, was located on the western periphery of the temple. “The Ranibas used to boast 208 wells and as many lotus ponds, but most are buried, some dried up, and only a handful remains now,” said Anirudra Mishra, a priest at the shrine.

Buried Kingdom
We tried in Simraungadh to locate some ruins that bore the barest testimony to its glorious past. Save for some relics at Ranibas, the locals, however, failed to point even to stray old lumps of bricks that once belonged to the last king’s palace or that fortified the high walls of the old city.
Relics at Ram Mandir
It looked nothing remained, which evoked some faint images of the erstwhile Kingdom.  A local fellow, however, told us that if dug up no deeper than a few feet any place around the 28 sq-km area of the old city, it would fetch medieval-era artifacts and earthen pots. Nay even gold and silver!
Legends, myths, and history spoke loud and clear about Simraungadh’s vibrant past. But on completion of our tour, it was hard to believe that the dusty and dreary little town revelled once as the capital city of a booming medieval kingdom ruled by a sagacious Karnata King. As it stands, the kingdom lies buried into the bowels of the earth.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/ride-through-sindhuligadhi-three-child-cyclists-steal-the-show.html,"Shubham (left), Suyog (Right) and Aditya (2nd from Right) preparing to ride to Janakpur
As over 170 cyclists rode to Janakpur from Kathmandu during the 4th edition of the annual Ride Through Sindhuligadhi event last weekend, three kids caught everyone’s eye.
Shubham Shrestha, Suyog Man Basnyat and Aditya Shrestha are just eight, 10 and 13 respectively; but they were all prepared to cycle the 250-kilometre journey to Janakpur via Sindhuligadi.  All three of them seemed to push each other one peddle at a time along with dozens of adults on the way. While Aditya and Shubham skipped a part of the climb to Sindhugadhi from Mulkot, Suyog along with his father Yogendra Man Singh Basnyat completed the entire route on his bicycle.
Many were surprised seeing their stamina. “What these kids are doing is remarkable. Riding with adults along the dangerous tarmac road is quite inspiring. Not only have they pushed each other, but they have also inspired other riders who had self-doubt,” shares Sudip Poudel, the ride leader of the event.
The boys were not only inspirations but were also the stars of the show. From local villagers to fellow riders, everyone wanted a selfie with the trio whenever they stopped for water breaks. They were celebrities for three days.
Suyog and Shubham giving an interview.
All three boys picked up cycling from a young age. The fathers of all three, who are also cyclists, over the course of a few years groomed these kids’ passion for cycling.
“Suyog started when he was three, but he began participating in these rallies when he was six. He’s always showed a desire towards cycling. As I ride, he wanted to do the same and I don’t see any harm in him doing this. He enjoys cycling and its challenges and I like to see him overcome these challenges,” shares Yogendra, his father.
The same was the case with Aditya, whose father Deepak Shrestha facilitated his son’s passion for cycling.
“I like him riding his bike and being a part of these events. I feel it gives many people the urge to do the same. He is passionate about it and also enjoys doing this. I hope his love and enthusiasm for cycling never dies,” says Deepak, adding he brought his son Aditya after watching Suyog cycling nearly the entire length of the ride last year.
“I enjoy riding. It makes me feel good. I don’t do enough of these long tours but when I get the chance, I enjoy it quite a bit. Sometimes my father does not let me ride the entire length of these tours, but it’s still fun cycling up to whatever point I can,” adds Aditya.
Shubham rides with fellow riders
Shubham too has the same enthusiasm on his face. He rides a bicycle which is clearly for the kids older than him but still, he rides with ease. While peddling, he has to stand up and after he gathers some momentum, he sits down. From a small town of Udayapur, he had come to Kathmandu with his father and his uncle to ride to Janakpur. But due to some problems, his father had to return leaving the eight-year-old with his uncle
His father Chiran shares that Shubham, like Aditya and Suyog, started riding from six.
“We take him on rides regularly in Udayapur. He enjoys it. He loves his bicycle. His technique is quite different but he seems to be comfortable with it. We take him out every Saturday and whenever events like this happen. He’s been the start of the show this year. I hope he can make it here again the next year.”
When asked if he was afraid while riding on the road from Kathmandu to Janakpur, young Shubham says he rather enjoyed it. He shares that he liked the attention he received from others. But he did get a bit angry when asked to take the bus from Khurkot to Sindhuligadhi. Sitting on the bus, he kept on posing the same question, “Why did they put me here? I want to be out there.”
“We took the decision because he’s too young and the uphill is too long. Maybe in a few years’ time, he can do the complete ride,” explains Poudel.
Aditya checking if the breaks of his bikes are working properly
But them being on the trip is enough to motivate cyclists. Rabit Maharjan, an adult participant of the event, shares that watching Suyog climb up the uphill to Sindhuligadhi gave him the motivation to ride on. The same was the case for McDara O’Shea from Ireland. O’Shea, who is embarking on a cycling journey from London to Singapore, shares that all three kids gave him added motivation.
“They are brilliant. You see people watching these kids and admiring their guts and determination. I feel quite privileged to have ridden with these young boys. I hope they carry on cycling,” he adds.
When asked if they will do the ride again, the boys say that they would love to, however, their parents say that only time will tell what happens next.
The orgasiners also feel that the participation of these young boys is important in the longer run. “Last year, we only had Suyog. This year, we had Aditya and Shubham. People have promised us that they too will bring their kids along this ride, which means that these kids are doing something really great,” explains Poudel.",/travel,"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 05:01:58 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/living-with-mahakali-the-river-of-contradictions-photo-story.html,"The Mahakali is a river of contradictions. The river, which originates near the Tibetan plateau, is rich in resources, yet people living on its banks are poor and marginalised; the river nourishes life on its banks, but it also wreaks havoc from time to time.
The Mahakali bridge joins Chandani and Dodhara villages west of the river to the rest of Nepal.
The Mahakali bridge, which connects Chandani and Dodhara villages to the rest of Nepal is also full of contradictions. While sand and pebbles mined on the banks of the river are used to build concrete bridges elsewhere, the bridge here is made of metal.

 
 

 
Sand and pebble miners returning to Nepali land.
The Mahakali gushes through the slopes of western Nepal carrying debris and sand with it. The sand is mined and transported to the market. The contradiction here is that while the sand provides much-needed life-saving money for the local community, unscientific mining has increased the risk of life-threatening floods. In addition to that, destructive fishing practices such as poisoning and electrocution of fish in the river are also taking a toll on local livelihood.
 
Women groups in the lower reaches of the Mahakali are taking the lead in local conservations.

With most of the men in the area leaving their homes in search of work in India and beyond, it is now up to the local women to take up the challenge to deal with the contradictions of the Mahakali. With support from Oxfam’s Transboundary Rivers of South Asia (TROSA), they have formed women’s groups to lobby for policy changes to conserve the river and its resources.
Women’s groups meet regularly to discuss various local issues.
While the groups are just starting out, their work looks promising. Some of the groups have set up fish conservation areas where destructive fishing has been banned. The groups hold regular discussions with local representatives of their municipalities to discuss ways to conserve the river.

Children take a dip in the Mahakali on a hot day.
The Mahakali river has changed a lot; some of the changes may be irreversible. But there is a hope that the local communities will take the lead to save it.",/travel,"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 06:26:32 +0000"

The number of internet users in the country has increased by 2.5 million in the past six months, according to the Nepal Telecommunications Authority.
Around 18.6 million people were using the internet until mid-May last year. But, as of mid-November, the number rose to 21.1 million, according to a recent report of the regulatory body.
In the recently launched Management Information System report, it is said the 71.52 per cent of the total population in Nepal is now connected to the internet. However, in reality, the number can be less considering that some of the subscribers have more than one internet connection.
The report shows a significant rise in the numbers of fixed broadband and mobile internet users, says NTA director and spokesperson Min Prasad Aryal.  As many as 13 million people use Nepal Telecom’s service and 6.9 million people use Ncell. A total of 3.5 million people are using Wi-Fi and FTTH services collectively.

Kathmandu, February 2

The central bank has fined Nepal Bangladesh Bank for its failure to meet the target set for investment in the agricultural sector.
The regulatory bank requires every commercial bank to invest at least 25 per cent of its total loan amount in the sectors that it has identified as priority areas. According to the rule, at least 10 per cent of the total loan should be given to the agricultural sector.
But, the NB Bank’s investment in the sector in the last fiscal year 2018/19 is less than nine per cent of the total loan amount. Hence, it paid back an amount equal to the interest of the insufficient amount.
Meanwhile, the bank has said it has increased its investment in all priority sectors this year, assuring it will not be fined again. “In the first five months, our investment amount has cross 10 per cent mark in agriculture,” says the bank’s spokesperson Suresh Devkota.

“Kasai lai Australia Kaanda chahieko chha? Comment garnuhos, ma pathaidiula. (Does anybody want the Australia Kaanda? Comment and I will send it to you.)”
The above statement appeared in many tweets in the second half of January. Many social media users, by now, have already known that it was all about a pornographic video supposedly of a Nepali woman residing in Australia. While the girl in the video has been assumed to be a Nepali, it is unsure whether she is indeed Nepali or not.  Some of these kaanda-wala posts have been responded with thousands of comments.
Leaked sex videos often easily garner such attention in Nepal and are labelled as ‘Kaanda’, which translates to ‘a scandal’. There have been many kaandas among social media users in Nepal in the past few years, and most of them resemble the recent Australia Kaanda. The reactions to the videos are also not much different.
Irrespective of how the videos are leaked, the consequent reactions victimise girls or women appearing in such videos as they are subjected to trolls, memes and sexist jokes, suggestive or offensive comments, and moral policing among others. But social media users do not care about it. Though sexist posts and remarks are spontaneous and casual on social media, they demonstrate such behaviours are deeply rooted in the society’s sexist prejudices and have already been institutionalised, believe experts and activists.
Control of women’s sexuality
Such mannerisms are not limited to Kaandas only. These are ubiquitous on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram among others, attacking specific women in particular, but women in general.  
Santosh Giri (Gurung), a lecturer at the Department of Gender Studies of Tribhuvan University, says the language used in social media reflects how patriarchy controls women’s control over their sexuality. Such language may stem out of a joke or out of hate, but the expressions have been undermining women since the development of human civilisation, she argues.

Men tend to either joke upon women or raise moral questions whenever women think or talk about their sexualities. While they can be expressive of their sexuality, women are supposed to be bounded, Giri says, adding the sexist social media posts are also a part of that tradition.
“It is all about the male ego,” Giri says. “Women have been treated as sexual objects and child-bearing machines.  Men with traditional patriarchal mindsets believe in the differences between masculinity and femininity, and objectification of women. The language oriented towards such perceptions devalues women and only seeks to control the sexuality of women.”
She believes that men have not been able to stand the women who have broken the traditional roles and hence express their intolerance through bully, teasing, hate or revenge. Men also bear hatred towards women when women oppose or resist their approach.
Sanjog Thakuri, a feminist activist, says, “The rights related to sexuality are still one of the least debated issues in Nepal. Sexism in Nepali social media sphere is toxic and arises from a narrow-minded mindset.”  He argues that gender-based abuse is far beyond the binary relationship of men and women, “but people are yet to acknowledge the existence of sexuality of other groups.”
He further adds that misogyny is a byproduct of fear of losing power that the patriarchal society has been abusing, stating that women are not only being objectified in verbal manners but also through religious and cultural symbols. “In Terai, rivulets are considered a symbol of a woman, but people erect a stick in the middle of a rivulet supposedly to control its wilderness. What will a girl think about her sexuality when she observes such practice?” he questions, “Won’t she think that her sexuality needs to be controlled by men? Or being ‘wild’ is a bad thing?”
The transitional phenomenon 
Men in a patriarchal society feel that they can dominate women from what they learn in the family and socialisation.
Giri says, “If a boy was labelled ‘impotent’ by his peers when he does not have five or six girlfriends, the boy would try to achieve a status and therefore would take women as objects”
She adds “It always has been the cultural practice, both in the east and the west. The ancient times were dominated by male philosophers. For example, ancient Greek philosophers created a binary opposition between men and women and cited men as superior in many respects.”
She further expands her example by citing a couplet from Ramayana, which plainly translates as “Dhol (a musical instrument), low-caste men, domestic animals and women: all deserve a good beating or control.” It means the men on social media might have been feeling that they are doing what women deserve.

But, many people believe that the Nepali society is transforming into modernity. But why do the patriarchal behaviours exist even in this digital age?
Giri has an answer to it. Nepali society is still in transition in terms of sex, sexuality and gender roles and the social media posts about such kaandas reflect the confusion, according to Giri. “On the one hand, the Nepali society wants to embrace ‘progressive’ impacts of development as in the west, and on the other, it has not let go the traditional values.”
Thakuri concurs, “The social, cultural and religious propaganda against talking about sex has limited the scope of discussions on sexuality. That is why it is not discussed in the public arena or even taught properly at school.”
Difficulty in dealing
Although ignoring such posts can be the best option for women sometimes, ignoring might not be the actual solution. As Giri puts it, sexism needs to be resisted in social platforms before it takes an extreme form.
However, most responses resisting such posts on social media are identical, “Tero gharma aama, didibahini chhainan? [Don’t you have mother and sisters at home?]”, in a hope that such comments would pinch men to their hearts.
Thakuri views that such responses are effective as their pride and sentiments get hurt when talking about their own mother or sisters. Giri also thinks so, “While men like to point their fingers on others, they are rather protective in case of their family members.”
But while women defend themselves by mentioning the perpetrators’ mother and sisters, the line has developed itself as a meaningless cliché.
“It is because women are not aware of their rights,” Giri suggests. “Maybe they are unaware of their own situations and the idiosyncrasy of their exploitations. There have not been many feminists in the country who would voice women’s concerns.”
Thakuri believes that the best way to combat sexism is through policy. “Policy on gender equality is important to tackle the narrow-mindedness of society. The issue of sexuality should be debated and discussed in an open platform. Also, the education system should embrace teaching about sexuality and gender equality.",/lifestyle,"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 04:44:39 +0000"

For most of the Hindu households in Nepal, the Swasthani Brata Katha needs no introduction. This religious text, a compilation of mythological stories about the goddess Swasthani and other Hindu gods and goddesses becomes a part of daily life for an entire month every year. Whereas the monthlong ritual is quite popular in Nepali villages, of late many Nepali feminists have questioned the text’s relevance arguing it is apparently patriarchal and sexist.
Jessica Vantine Birkenholtz, a scholar of gender and religion from the United States, studied the tradition multiple times in order to interpret it from a feminist perspective and found both perceptions of the tradition, as a patriarchal custom and an embodiment of the feminine power, were valid. Besides her dissertation ‘Seeking Swasthani: The Politics of Gender, Location, Iconography, and Identity in Hindu Nepal’, she has published a book titled ‘Reciting the Goddess: Narratives of Place and the Making of Hinduism in Nepal’. A winner of the American Academy of Religion Award for Excellence in the Study of Religion in the Textual Studies category in 2019, Birkenholtz is currently an associate professor of Asian Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies in Penn State College of Liberal Arts.
Onlinekhabar recently talked to Birkenholtz about her observations of the ritual, its historical development and its patriarchal and feminine agenda. Excerpts:
Where did you first hear about the goddess Swasthani? Why did you decide to research it further?

I heard about the goddess when I was in Nepal for the first time in 1996. I read about her in a book and even did a month-long project while I was doing an abroad programme under my undergraduate degree. But I only started researching the Swasthani traditions and Katha in detail, years later, for my dissertation. The research began roughly in 2003, but the majority was between 2004 and 2006.
The reason why I decided to delve into the topic is that it brought together my interests in women and their traditions. Another reason was that the goddess though being a household name is not known outside Nepal. Neither are there enough manuscripts of the tradition or existence outside Swasthani Brata Katha. She is an enigma, very complicated, yet crucial in the study of Hinduism.
My work was motivated not by an interest in Swasthani as a goddess per se, but in the Swasthani Brata Katha, as a 16th century Hindu devotional tradition that was focused on women and still widely celebrated in the modern period. Moreover, the text has changed considerably between the 16th and 21st centuries so I was interested in understanding what these textual changes were and what they could tell us about Nepal’s social, cultural, and religious history and identity.
Can you please explain in brief how you dealt with this ‘exotic’ topic?
My focus was on the historical developments of the Swasthani Brata Katha so the majority of times, during the initial phases in the research, I spent my time in libraries including Kaiser Library and Asha Saphu Kuthi. Then I spent significant time in Sankhu too. During this, I was able to collect and read manuscripts of the Swasthani Brata Katha. I came across many texts, around 800 of them, among which I examined about 125 manuscripts and closely read about two dozens of them, which were dated, in good shape and complete.
In the course of my research, I also met and interviewed many of the locals, scholars, historians including Prabin Raj Shrestha, Aishwarya Dhar Sharma, Jwala Sthapit Tuladhar, and Prakash Man Shrestha who really helped me understand the text and the importance of the culture. They also helped me connect and communicate with many other people whom I interviewed during the research.
I also learned Nepali, Nepal Bhasa and Sankrit languages during my stay in Nepal at different times. And I got several opportunities to closely observe the Swasthani Brata Katha and the related rituals. Though I did not take the fast, I stayed with the women there who were taking the fast in Sankhu; I used to get up with them, follow them and observe all the rituals, to really understand the culture.
There was a fair share of problems to deal with too. The language barrier (my spoken Nepali was not that good at first)… the access to some resources… they were not available easily, and the ongoing ‘load-shedding’ schedule (scheduled power outage) and Maoists insurgency, all had to be taken into consideration. It was all a painstakingly long process yet the most insightful.
What were your personal observations of the Swasthani Brata Katha? What fascinated you during your research?
When asked about Hindu texts, Ramayana and Mahabharata might be the most common or famous texts anyone relates to, outside Nepal. Yet in my research, Swasthani textbook was and is on a par with or even more important than the two epics, or any other Puranas and Vedas.
Figuring out the meaning for her name on its own was difficult and its connection to rituals or stories was interesting. The lack of iconography, visual depiction of the goddess outside modern times and the confusion among people considering Madhav Narayan idols as Swasthani were also intriguing.
What was interesting about the textual evidence, in particular, was that we can see a shift. The first 200 years of the tradition were about Goma, Chandrawati, Navaraj and Swasthani. After that, three major additions can be found. The first is the story of Shiva and Parvati; the second is the narrative of Krishna including Madhu-Kaitabha and the creation of the universe. The third is the stories about Vrinda, Kamadev and others.
And due to this shift of narrative two-thirds of the stories today are of Shiva and only the latter part of the story is about Swasthani. Comparing the texts in Nepal Bhasa and Nepali, Nepal Bhasa texts are more heterogeneous while the Nepali language texts are more in number and in the influence to establish the Hindu identity and patriarchy.
So have you found any evidence that suggests this shift in the narratives?
There is no concrete evidence as to why there is a shift in the narrative. Yet if we are to compare the dates of the manuscripts, printed versions of the book, the language it was written in, to that of the historical developments in Nepal or even India, we can see some hints. The texts suggest that Swasthani was first written in Nepal Bhasa (early as 693 Nepal Sambat or around 1573 AD) by Jayanta Dev when the Newar kings were prominent rulers in the Kathmandu Valley.
But from the 18th century, we can see Nepali versions of Swasthani with the Shah rulers in the Valley and the British Empire’s influence in India. Though nothing is concrete here, we can just speculate that; maybe because of this, there has been the shift and additions to the narrative in Swasthani Brata Katha. The changes may reflect the focus on something more than the Nepal Mandala and the influence of socio-political changes.
Having said that, the stories of the goddess Swasthani herself, her role in the story and her importance or even the rituals that the pilgrims undertake during the brata (in Magh) have not changed, neither have their beliefs.

Speaking of her pictures, you have mentioned in your book that the “portrayal of the goddess is surprising as independent and unfettered by a male companion”. Why and in what ways, did you say that?
In mythologies, the women are portrayed in two major forms; one where they are calm, composed and benign, and always with a consort or a husband like Parvati and Saraswati, and second where they are unmarried without a male consort, but fierce and warriors like Durga and Kali.
But the goddess Swasthani is a very complicated figure and quite different from all. She does not have a prominent male consort; there is no explicit imagery or texts that say it. On the other hand, she is calm and composed, yet described as a fierce unforgiving figure in Chandrawati’s story.
However, she has been pictured with Lord Shiva (on a statue at Makkhan) but the popular picture is of her sitting on a lotus flower between the Astamatrika (like in Sankhu).
If we are to look at the Swasthani Brata Katha from a feminist perspective, how would you define it?
When it comes to the story, it has received many criticisms that the stories inside it are too patriarchal as they endorse Sati Devi’s self-immolation for her husband, Goma’s early marriage, and Vrinda’s rape. And there are people who believe that the stories are empowering, see their journey from struggle to success, and are relevant and educational. It will depend on how you look at it. It is important to understand where the person is speaking from, which aspects of the story they are relating to, what empowers them or what they disagree to.
But the stories (mostly in Nepali), as I perceive it, are more of a written document of hegemonic Brahmin narratives written by Brahmin men, for Brahmin men. They do not really speak out any women-centric voice. This also goes back to the influence of Hindu, Brahman culture and influence from the rulers.
So, as a feminist myself, from a personal point of view, I do not see Swasthani as a feminist story. And as an analyst, I struggle to think if anyone reads the story and does not question it critically, will it be okay? Or say if they think “it is our culture, so that’s how it should be”, will it be okay?
Recently, there has been a new narrative of Ramayana from the eyes of Sita, as Sitayana. I believe there is a need for a feminist perspective of the story and see the difference, start a different kind of conversation.
You say there is a need for scholarly attention regarding the Swasthani text. But why?
Swasthani is a large body of knowledge. By reading Swasthani textbooks alone, we can see the shift of narratives, and how the manuscripts travelled, observe the additional narratives, their similarities and differences.
Another reason why I say that is because even today, studying Hinduism or South Asia in countries like the USA is synonymous with studying India while studying Nepal is like an extension of India. So it is important to bring these Hindu scripts in light to fight the hegemonic status and bring out the separate culture and history of Nepal.
I am currently working on the English translation of Swasthani (from Nepali); it is something I wanted to do. The non-Nepali population of the world has not been able to read the text [that is in Nepali, Newari or Sanskrit]. I believe, if the text is readily available to the rest of the world, it will create a conversation about the story, the teachings, the historical and mythological importance as well as the shift in the narratives we can see. And I think it will also initiate discourses from the feminist perspectives.
As a gender scholar, what is your observation of the Nepali society today?
From the time I first arrived in Nepal, the scenario has changed quite significantly. It had deep-rooted patriarchal status, asymmetric power dynamics and gender roles. Women were not allowed to show their shoulders, wear short dresses. No western fashion or clothing… Today, most importantly, they are getting more opportunities and access to education. It is very crucial in terms of growth and equality, it shows strength and is visible.
In recent times, there are many campaigns that have been organised for gender identities and equality from the sexual and gender minorities for awareness, acceptance, for existence and safety. It shows the loosening of gender expectations in society. However, the expectations of caste-based marriage, heterogeneous marriage and socioeconomic status are still the same.",/interview,"Tue, 04 Feb 2020 04:27:00 +0000"

It was around 8 in the evening when Suman Gartaula of Human Service Ashram called me, “Astha (name changed) is no more.”
Astha was one of the voices that we had missed to listen to, a face that we do not usually recognise. For a journalist like me, that was a story we seldom cover.
Gartaula had called me around two weeks before that. “We have rescued a woman who was held captive in a hotel in Gongabu for two years and sexually exploited.”
Astha, later I thought, was a victim of a big network of internal human trafficking racketeers in Kathmandu.
“Her liver has been damaged”, Gartaula had told me. “Her vagina is damaged too. It is difficult to save her.”
—
Astha was lying in her bed at the intensive care unit of Bir Hospital. She was given saline intravenously. Her breathing was making a heavy roaring sound, resonating along with the beep of the bedside monitor that was indicating her vitals.
Astha was only 23.
Her abdomen was inflated, but she was not pregnant. “She needs a liver transplant operation,” the doctor said. “We don’t have any alternative. Her inflated stomach is a consequence of her damaged liver.”
A urine bag, half full, was hanging on her bed.
—
She was afraid at first when she saw three to four people. We first needed to win her trust to talk to her.
“We are here to talk with you so that we can help in apprehending the wrongdoers.”
After some moments, her eyes were filled with tears.
We asked her if she could talk. She nodded.
—
Born in Burtibang of Baglung district, Astha was working in a road construction project in the district. There were many labourers from other parts of the country also. A boy from Sindhupalchok was working with her. Astha’s life took a different road when she got married to the boy and moved to Melamchi, Sindhupalchok.
Astha was only 13 at the time. Child marriage is still common in southern Baglung.
For the first couple of years, Astha found her husband so affectionate. But, he started beating her regularly then. She felt she was cheated. “He used to beat me with a steel pipe,” Astha remembered.
But she did not leave her husband. Astha bore a daughter when she was 14 and a son when she was 16. Her husband had started working as a truck driver by then.
Although financially weak, her husband would be drunk every night, and he would beat Astha repeatedly.
“Once he broke my foot. I needed to have it in plaster and had bed rest for three months.”
One night in those three months, her husband did not return. The next day, a neighbour told her the bad news: her husband was floating in a pond. Astha got frightened. She walked with a stick, dragging her broken foot and reached the verge of the pond.
“Someone had hit him on the nose, with a brick” Astha remembered vividly with tears in her eyes.
After her husband’s death, she went back to Burtibang with her children, but another misfortune struck her: her mother died. Her father was in the Indian Army. He had not returned home for years; maybe he had already passed away. Astha was their single child.
To earn her living, Astha started working at local restaurants in Burtibang as a cleaner. But the owners would not pay her. “They would just give me food and let me sleep.”
It was around one year later when a lady, whom she knew during her work, proposed her to go to Nagarkot (near Kathmandu) together and also to her house in Melamchi.
Astha was penniless, but she agreed. The lady paid for her transportation. She left for Kathmandu and reached Gongabu on a cold mid-December evening. The companion told her to wait. The lady said, “I need to buy another ticket.”
Astha waited for hours, but the lady did not come back.
Then, Astha was approached by a policeman, who gave her a cup of tea. He also offered shelter at his brother’s house. The brother was also a cop and his wife was pregnant. Astha began doing household works for the family and taking care of the pregnant landlady.
But she felt guilty for living there. She considered herself a burden in the family. She went out, hunting for jobs.

She visited many hotels and found a job in a five-storeyed one. The hotel promised her Rs 8,000 as a salary.
She started off as a housekeeping staffer and joined the kitchen later. Everything was okay, but she was barred from the outside world there. Since there were other female colleagues as friends, she did not take that seriously though.

Her only concern was her kids left at the house of her husband’s brother in Melamchi. She wanted to send some money for her children, but she was not paid as promised.
It has been around three months since she had been working there when the wife of the owner sent her to a room to serve food. Obedient, Astha did not question her. But the man inside the room grabbed her hands. She resisted and stormed out from the room to the owner’s wife.
But, the owner’s wife dragged her back to the room and locked her inside. Astha’s body was sold.
After a while, the owner’s wife came back, dragged her back downstairs and spilled boiling water at her hands. She said, “Your hands are strong only because I fed you nutritious delicacies.”
Then, Astha could not get out of that hell. The only option for her was to obey whatever she was told to. Otherwise, they (the clients) would put their cigarettes on her skin. Her clients were Nepalis and Indians, primarily drivers and conductors. The owners would receive Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 from each client for one time Astha had sex with them. She would only get cigarette burns.
The owner’s wife was pregnant then. When she was admitted to the hospital for delivery, the owner offered Astha some liquor. Astha denied, but she was stuffed into. The owner also raped her. Astha remembered, “I was relieved when his wife was discharged on the 11th day.”
It had been more than one-and-a-half years. Her vagina had started to swell. She had several wounds. Astha used to request her colleagues to bring her medicine. But the owner’s wife would throw them away. Soon, her abdomen started to inflate.
She felt she got a major opportunity to get out of that hell. One day, when the owner and his wife were not there, she ran away. Freed at last after months, she craved a cup of tea, but she blacked out before reaching the teashop.
When she opened her eyes next, she was on the roof of a house. A group of people was around her.

The locals called Human Service Ashram to inform about Astha on October 22, 2019. Social workers associated with the organisation reacted swiftly.
She was taken to Green City Hospital in Tokha of Kathmandu, but the organisation could not afford the charges.  She was transferred to Bir Hospital’s ICU immediately.
Astha’s concern, when she was in the ICU, was still her children. “I wish I could send the money I saved to my children.”
“Can you walk?”
“I can, comfortably. I will help the police to grab the people who did this to me.” But, it was just her self-confidence.
In the meantime, she was excited to know that the police were looking to catch the perpetrators who ‘sold’ her.

A week after I talked to her, Astha breathed her last.

We contacted the police to know whether they were able to capture the culprits. DSP Hobindra Bogati responded, “We roamed around Gongabu with Astha in search of the hotel. But we could not. Based on her descriptions, we have filed a case against three people.
Police caught Krishna Bahadur G C of Pyuthan, Karna Bahadur Chand of Surkhet, and Rudra Bahadur Pachai of Gulmi for an investigation.
Bogati informed that these persons owned different hotels in Kathmandu and had been nabbed for their alleged involvement in human trafficking. However, the case is not registered at the court yet.",/lifestyle,"Wed, 05 Feb 2020 03:52:28 +0000"

The anti-corruption constitutional body, Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, on Wednesday filed a charge-sheet at the Special Court indicting 175 persons on irregularities in the encroachment of government land in Baluwatar of Kathmandu. The case is popularly known as Baluwatar or Lalita Niwas land scam.
Completing its yearlong investigation, the commission filed the case against three former ministers, 57 former or current government officials, and 115 former and current owners and users of the land. Of them, 65 should not be fined or punished, but they should be made to return the land, according to the commission.
The former deputy minister and Nepali Congress leader Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, former ministers Chandra Dev Joshi and Dambar Shrestha have faced the charge. Gachhadar, a sitting House of Representatives member, will be suspended as a lawmaker till the court gives a final verdict in the case.
Among the officials include the then government secretary Deep Basnyat, who also became the chief of the CIAA later; former secretary Dinesh Hari Adhikari, also a popular lyricist and poet; and former secretary Chhabi Raj Panta.
Likewise, Bhat-Bhateni Supermarket and Departmental Store owner Min Bahadur Gurung has faced the charge for purchasing the land and selling it to others. Among the current owners of the land, the Non-resident Nepali Association has been told to return the land to the government.

To visit Muktinath, a Hindu and Buddhist religious shrine in Mustang district of western Nepal, the autumn is considered the best season. The weather conditions during this season are perfect for walking around and sightseeing. I chose the same season for my trip in the past, but this time I wanted to experience something different.
I visited the trans-Himalayan district in December, the peak of the winter. The experience, however, was more rewarding as I saw the shrine snow-blanketed.

I had always wondered how snow-clad Muktinath would look like. I got the answer.
The tour began as December approached its end. My friend from Laprak, Gam Bahadur Gurung, and from Base Camp Trek, Sunil Shrestha fixed the date. I travelled as an interpreter as we were accompanying 12 journalists from France TV.

Muktinath needs no introduction. It is one of the most popular destinations, globally and locally. However, Jong, a nearby destination from Muktinath is not much heard of. We had planned to visit Jong this time.

We flew to Pokhara from Kathmandu and then hired a jeep to Jomsom. The next trip was up to Kagbeni on the jeep. The heavy snow meant we could not go further on the vehicle.

Therefore, we headed toward Jong on horses. The French team had come to film a documentary titled ‘Secret Path’.

The whole place was blanketed by snow. The Dhaulagiri Mountain looked astonishing from Jong village. The village is artistically and culturally rich. The gumbas around here are very old.",/travel,"Thu, 06 Feb 2020 04:00:26 +0000"

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/this-nepali-zoologist-gave-his-name-to-a-snake-now-he-is-concerned-about-peoples-perception-of-the-reptile.html,"Trimeresurus karanshahi. Photo courtesy: Karan Bahadur Shah
Like other children of his neighbourhood, Karan Bahadur Shah was afraid of snakes. At the age of 10, his family migrated to the plains of Kanchanpur from Dadeldhura, and the fear of snakes heightened because more snakebite cases were reported there.
“The fear persisted till I was doing my master’s in zoology in the 20s,” the sexagenarian says, “But later, I developed an affinity towards this reptile because I wanted to do something new in my field.”
Around two decades ago, this pioneer herpetologist discovered a new snake species, and the scientific community named the species after him, an unprecedented achievement in the field of zoology in Nepal. Content with the feat, Shah, now, has a more serious concern–he feels that humans have not understood the importance of snakes. “They rather perceive the serpents as their enemies and kill many of them every year,” he says.
The Phulchoki finding
Since he began studying zoology, Shah was intrigued by snakes. “The number of snake species in Nepal was far less than the number of snake species in India. But I thought Nepal too should be home to at least half of the Indian species because the two countries have similar geographic and climatic conditions.”
As Shah tried his hand at the study of snakes, he got into contact with many scholars from different parts of the world. “During that time, many foreigners would come to Nepal to study various species. The government would allow them to take to other countries the animals and plants they found in Nepal for study,” he says.
It was during the 1996 late monsoon. Shah was hosting a team of international snake researchers. “We went to hills around Kathmandu almost every night for several days,” he recalls, “Then, we decided to do it in the daytime for a few days because it was raining frequently and we thought the snakes would come out in the sun to warm themselves.”
That particular day (he does not remember the date), Shah hired two vehicles for his team to travel up to Godavari in the early morning. They had planned to walk up to Phulchoki hill. His teenage son, Utkrisht, also showed interest in the trip as his school was closed that day.
“But he could not catch up with the adults so I had to leave my friends and walk with him,” he narrates, “I almost forgot my research work as I was busy talking to him. But coming down, something unexpected happened.”
It was past 10 am. The clouds had cleared and the sun had just emerged from the horizon. “Suddenly, I saw a green snake in front of me. As I approached it, the snake crawled towards a nearby hole. I ran towards the hole to catch its tail. Fortunately, I managed to bag it.”
Shah thought that it was just a snake belonging to one of five to six green snake species found in Nepal. He joined his colleagues at the Godavari station and told them about the incident. They photographed the serpent.
The snake remained in Shah’s bag for the next few days. After concluding the study for that season, one of the researchers, Nikolai Orlov from Russia proposed that he take the snake captured by Shah along with him. Shah agreed.
“But, he did not tell me anything about the results of the study for the next few months. Later I found that they took time because the characteristics of that snake did not match that of others. Hence, they suspected if it was a new species,” Shah says, “Orlov visited many other places and summoned specimens from other menageries. Finally, they concluded that the snake belonged to a species not recorded yet.”
The nomenclature
Perhaps the discovery was not an achievement in itself. There was something more Shah should have looked forward to.
Orlov and his friend Notker Helfenberger published their analysis of the same in the Russian Journal of Herpetology (Vol. 4, No. 2, 1997). In the article, the two scientists named the new species as Trimeresurus karanshahi. The snake got named ‘Karan’s Pit Viper’ or ‘Shah’s Pit Viper’ in English, and ‘Karanko Hareu’ in Nepali. The researchers explained, “The species is named after Nepali herpetologist Karan B Shah, whose organising support was principal for realising the expedition” (sic).
Shah felt he was on cloud nine when he received a copy of the journal. He felt his dream “of doing something new” come true as no Nepali zoologist had been able to put his/her name after any species till then. Shah claims there is still no one in zoology who had achieved a similar feat till date though there are some in botany.
Shah believes having his name associated with a species is important because not everyone can achieve that despite discovering new species. “It’s not up to you to name the species you discover. Other researchers should acknowledge your contribution to the discovery, in a scientific journal recognised across the world,” he says. Besides, a number of naming systems exist in the field. It is up to the authors to name the new species after people, places or other characteristics.
Recognising the achievement, the government of Nepal published a postal stamp featuring Karan’s pit viper the next year.
Karan’s pit viper on a postal stamp
Critical concerns
Despite achieving such a ‘celebrated’ status in academia, Shah is not happy with people’s perception of snakes. He says the snakes should not be killed just because of some snakebite incidents.
“We need to understand is that all snakes are not venomous. In fact, only 10 percent of snakes are capable of injecting venom into other living bodies,” he says, “Secondly, all snakebite do not cause injury. Around 50 percent of cases are ‘dry bites’ in which the snakes cannot inject venom inside the human bodies.”
Then, people need to understand the contribution of these reptiles to the ecosystem and let them live freely, according to him. Snakes are carnivores and they balance the ecosystem by eating various insects and small mammals. “They also eat rodents. When applying other measures like poisoning and trapping, yourself could be a victim,” he jokes, “Practically, it is safer to let the serpents eat rodents around you.”
Protecting snakes is also necessary because their venom can be used in various medicines, Shah suggests.
However, he is aware of the tragedies that snakebite can cause. Nepal records around 20,000 snakebite incidents every year, and a few dozen people die. But Shah still argues that killing snakes is not a solution.
“Yes, I know. My brother’s grandson was bitten by a snake in Mahendranagar last year while he was asleep inside the home,” he says, “But, before talking about the risks, we need to keep ourselves safe.”
Shah claims snakes do not bite unless they feel threatened. Hence, people should stay away from snakes. However, during the summers, they frequent human residences in the search of cooler places as the surface and underground temperatures increase. Likewise, when it floods, they come to dry places for safety. “Therefore, during high-risk seasons, stay prepared. Keep your doors and windows closed,” he advises, “Whenever you go out, cover the body with sleeved clothes and boots. Carry a torch if you walk in the dark.”
“Seeking help from shamans and traditional healers is a bigger problem than the snakebite itself,” he says, “The Nepal government gives anti-venoms for free in all of its health facilities and they can save your life.”",/lifestyle,"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 05:18:30 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/ghamad-shere-movie-review-interesting-blend-of-political-satire-and-undesirable-romance.html,"
When social media users jokingly connected an angry-faced image of Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba with ‘Ghamad Shere’ last week, the movie received some free promotion. Now, as the movie is already being screened, it is clear that the movie is not related to the former prime minister in any way. Yet, the movie is precisely related to Nepal’s political system in which the powerful easily manipulate the law for their vested interests, inconsiderate of common people’s feelings.
Besides being a satire, the movie is a romantic love story. The development of intimacy between two actors, played by the real-life couple of Nischal Basnet and Swastima Khadka, is interesting to watch though it is morally undesirable. Likewise, there are many other things that a critical and sensitive viewer wishes the movie could have avoided. However, the way that the movie interconnects a political satire and a romantic love story is what makes it an interesting watch.
Sharp satire
Ghamad Shere is one step ahead of other contemporary productions in terms of satirising the current political system. Whereas the mainstream media outlets occasionally report the lack of resources at local government bodies to execute the rights delegated by the constitution, the cinema industry had never covered the issue in this depth.
This movie clearly shows how the absence of qualified officials at local government authorities mocks the system. Here in the film, you see a police officer encouraging an innocent individual to file a complaint against a rivulet so as to hide his incompetence. The mayor and his deputy play with the system in cahoots with local power brokers and misinterpret the law while the helpless public continue to remain at the receiving end. This context is somewhat relatable to the reality in Nepal.
As the movie reaches its end, you know that the mishandled political system teaches genuine and honest people also to manipulate existing provisions to meet their vested interests. This film shows how power corrupts people like our hero, Shere (Basnet), illegally launches sand and aggregate-extraction business at the end.
The romance that no one looks forward to
The movie’s only dance number–Kali Man Paryo Malai Gori Man Paryo–is a spoiler in this context. As the song tells you, our hero Shere falls in love with his saali, his wife Parvati (Sushma Niraula)’s cousin named Gauri (Khadka). Since Nepali society always jokes about saali-bhinaju affairs casually, it might not interest you.

Nevertheless, screenwriter and director Hem Raj BC plays a trick to keep the audience hooked: till around 15 minutes before the first half closes, you do not see any possibility of an extramarital knot. Shere is a dipsomaniac and Gauri vehemently hates the habit. Though she shows some intimacy with him whenever they meet, she equally respects him as a bhinaju (brother-in-law).
On the other hand, the hero is also an ethical guy; despite Parvati frequently irritating him about alcoholism, he has never thought of leaving her for another lady. After she fears that he loses all the money that he earned by toiling in a foreign land in the liquor, he has recently deposited Rs 800,000 to her account. The Shere-Parvati couple seems happily married overall; he assists her in doing the dishes whereas they also make TikTok videos occasionally. Though Parvati wants Shere to go back abroad, it seems she is concerned about the family’s livelihood. It hence seems the saali-bhinaju flirtation is just social and it will not develop any further.
But by the end of the first half, you are certain that a marriage between them is imminent. Without giving a hint of it, except the song, the writer-director skillfully forces you to change the perception of the characters along with the plot’s next course.
Because you know how the story will end at the end, the second half is a bit predictable. Yet, you will continue watching it because you want to know how the movie glorifies ‘morally corrupted’ hero and heroine (because, traditionally, all of such stories tend to glorify the protagonists for showing a clear-cut conflict with the antagonists).
Old errors
Despite such attractions, the movie frequently bores you. The project repeats most of the errors that critiques have been pointing at for decades. The first: the cheap way of showing sex. As Shere and Parvati make love on the upper floor, his parents sleeping downstairs feel disturbed. The final sequence also includes an intimate scene, and it does not add any value to the movie. The second: the use of physical disabilities to make people laugh. A minor character of the movie cannot speak fluently and the movie makes fun of him. The third: the unnecessary repetition of the word ‘Ghamad’ to stress the theme. The fourth: including a fight scene at the end though ending the movie before the fight could have made a better sense.

Cinematography-wise, the movie is an average production. The opening scene is cliched; you see a vehicle moving on a serpentine road for around one minute. The camera angle changes but you do not see anything new for the entire minute. Though the director tries to play with radio sounds to set background for a couple of scenes, the sound work fails to make any impact. A rainstorm scene appears out of the blue–it seems quite improbable. But the camerawork is okay.
Acting-wise, the lead actors–Basnet, Khadka, and Niraula–have done their job fairly. Niraula has signaled a promising future in her debut project. Another actor, Roy, also makes an impression. However, no attention has been paid in the making of minor characters. There is a child and he could have made the audience turn emotion in some scenes if he had been trained well.
Verdict
Both as a satire and a love story, this movie has raised concerns over some genuine issues. Thanks to the interesting plot and convincing acting, the movie turns out to be a good watch. If the team succeeds in avoiding some of the formulaic errors, it could produce better movies in the days to come.

Nearly three months have passed since India published its new political map incorporating the disputed region of Kalapani in its territory, triggering protests in Nepal. As the dispute still awaits a solution, the two governments seem passive.

As per its schedule of the election, the Federal Parliament Secretariat received only one nomination for the position within the allocated time, Parliament’s General Secretary Manohar Prasad Bhattarai informs. However, Sapkota will not be declared the winner today.
Sapkota’s election to the position will be announced during the House meeting to be held coming Sunday, January 26.
Earlier, the NCP’s Subas Chandra Nembang had filed his nomination as a proposer. The party’s Dev Gurung and Onsari Gharti and Rastriya Janata Party Nepal’s Laxman Lal Karna had seconded it.
The main opposition Nepali Congress decided not to field its candidacy as the NCP has sufficient votes required to elect its candidate the speaker. Though the party expected the NCP to support it for the deputy speaker, it is unlikely.

Kathmandu, January 21
Whereas the government is under fire for introducing controversial Information Technology Bill and the Bill on Special Service that could jeopardise people’s freedom of expression and right to privacy, yet another bill introduced by the government has also drawn a strong objection from a major stakeholder.
Jitram Lama, the president of NGO Federation of Nepal, says the government is trying to gradually close down all nongovernment organisations operating in the country by introducing the Bill on Organisations. The Ministry of Home Affairs has finalised the draft and forwarded it to the Cabinet for further processing.
In an interview with Onlinekhabar, Lama claims the bill would complicate the process of registration and renewal of NGOs and restrict them to a limited scope. “It requires a tax clearance certificate, a recommendation from the concerned local government and police report to register and renew an organisation. It takes months to prepare all of them,” he says, “Do you think members of the organisations like child club, youth club or farmers’ group would have any concern for a tax clearance certificate?”
“Such complicated procedures have been introduced with the intention of stopping them from registration.”
He says the government does not require a business firm to submit a police report for registration, asking why it would be a must for the NGOs. “There are other laws to control crime,” he says, “Everyone should be allowed to enjoy the freedom of association.”
Lama says the federation has concluded that the bill is against sentiments of the constitution and it disrespects the NGOs’ contribution to Nepal’s development, adding, “Indirectly, the government is telling us not to open any organisation and close down the existing ones.”

Kathmandu, January 20
Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe says she resigned from the position so as to let the ruling Nepal Communist Party field its candidate for the speaker’s election that the House of Representatives will plan today.
Tumbahamphe’s resignation comes one day after two chairpersons of the party decided to field Agni Prasad Sapkota for the top parliamentary position. Before that, she was resisting the party’s directive for resignation, staking her claim in the position.
Since the constitution requires the speaker and the deputy speaker to represent different parties, Tumbahamphe’s resignation was a must for the NCP to contest the speaker’s election.
Hence, Tumbahamphe, while chairing the House of Representatives meeting today, announced, “I would like to inform the respected House that I decided to clear the roads.”

The main opposition Nepali Congress has asked the ruling Nepal Communist Party to support its candidate for the position of deputy speaker. Because the ruling party has nearly two-thirds majority lawmakers, whoever gets supports from its lawmakers will be elected.
As the current Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe is resigning so as to let the party field its candidate for the speaker, the opposition party’s chief whip Bal Krishna Khand said it expected that the NCP would let the Congress claim the deputy position.
Khand said lawmakers from his party would vote for the NCP’s candidate for the speaker if the NCP agreed to support the Congress candidate for the deputy speaker.

Two chairmen of the ruling Nepal Communist Party have almost agreed to nominated Agni Sapkota for the speaker’s election. If the party endorses the two leaders’ decision, Sapkota will be elected the chief of the House of Representatives.
During a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders in Baluwatar this morning, the agreement was made and the two leaders called the secretariat meeting for 4 pm today to endorse the decision, according to sources.
For the past few months, the two leaders were divided over who should be the party’s candidate for the speaker. The position is vacant since the resignation of Krishna Bahadur Mahara in October after he was accused of an attempt to rape.
Whereas Oli had been pressing the party to go for Subas Chandra Nembang, Dahal was adamant that the former Maoist Centre side should get a chance as Mahara belonged to the faction. Among the former Maoist leaders, his first choice was Sapkota.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/trekking-the-untravelled-path-to-khopra-danda.html,"When Chitra Pun told us we couldn’t get rooms at Khopra Danda even though we were the first to reach there, all of us were disappointed. The place was our main destination where Harman, Ranjan and I had planned to spend two days. However, Pun’s disrespectful behaviour towards us, and towards all Nepalis in general, put us off.
That one day nearly overshadowed our entire trip, but overall it was tiresome and memorable. We walked through some dense forests, up and down some steep hills and got to view the majesty of the mountains.
For someone as lazy as I am, I nearly walked 50 kilometres in five days which is something I had never done even on flatlands.
Even though I didn’t meet as many people as I would’ve liked on the trail, walking to Khopra is possibly one of the best treks I’ve done in my life, one that has taught me that you can walk as much as you can while you’re out in the wild.
Day 1
Machhapuchre seen from Ghandruk
Kathmandu to Ghandruk
I had never imagined hopping on a non-ac night bus to Pokhara from Kathmandu would be as tiring as it was. After failing to book tickets for other better buses, we had to board the one, humid, stinky and full of people. By the time we got to Pokhara at 5 am, we were shattered. However, getting to Pokhara was only the first part of our trip. We still had to get to Ghandruk, from where we had planned to start our week-long trek to Khopra Danda and back.
As soon as the local bus to Ghandruk started to move, I felt that the plan to save time by taking a night bus to Pokhara was a bad idea. My knees were cramped for room and the awful roads didn’t help my cause either. It was five hours of hell before we reached Kimche, from where our hour-long hike to Ghandruk started. I never thought that walking would be better than the bus ride. The weather at Ghandrunk wasn’t great, but still, the air was fresh and the people were lovely. Our trek had officially begun.

Day 2
Ghandruk to Isharu
After a comfortable stay at the Old Village Inn, we were on our way to Dobato. I didn’t want to walk as much as the boys insisted and this was going to be a long day as maps.me showed that Dobato was nearly 12 km away.
A view seen between Ghandruk and Tadapani
The initial walk to Tadapani was quite easy. You go downhill from Ghandruk for around 30 minutes, after which the trail starts to get uphill. I was told that the trail during the spring would have a lot of rhododendrons; however, I also came across a lot of monkeys on the trail.
Forests like these are a common sight on the trail.
The trail from Tadapani onwards was quite poor. It’s probably the worst trail I’d ever walked. It’s muddy, and not marked well. It is mostly uphill, especially up to a small resting spot called Meshar. The trail after that got a bit better, but still muddy. What made it worse was constant drizzling and misty weather. Had it been sunny, I guess I’d have enjoyed it more but when we came to a small village called Isharu, I couldn’t walk any longer. My mates decided Dobato was a long shot watching my state and decided to call it a day. Thank god!
Isharu wasn’t the best of place on the trail but surrounded by hills, it was quite nice. If you concentrated, you could see Pokhara and the Phewa Lake in the distance. The view made me regret staying there as the view from Dobato would have obviously been better, but the mushroom curry and rice wine we got there made up for most of it. As we were the only three people at the lodge, we were also given a lot of blankets.
Day 3
Isharu to Dhan Kharka
The day didn’t start as planned. We woke up late which no mountain view and it also meant that the day would end late. We had to walk another 10kms which didn’t go down well with me. But without being fussy, I was on my way.
Walking these narrow trails, we reached Dobato.
The initial walk up to Dobato was not hard. It took time, but the trail was quite nice. We even saw glimpses of Annapurna South behind the clouds. The trail was a bit narrow but I was not as bad the one up to Meshar. We reached Dobato relatively quickly, however, we did not get to see the view.
After a quick tea, we then started the walk up to Bayeli Kharka. This was probably the best part of this trail. It was mostly flat as you had to walk through some pretty narrow ridges. It was fun and it wasn’t hard. The cool breeze kept on reminding you that you were close to the mountains. There was no one on the trail, which felt great. I was walking alone looking at birds flying, bees taking nectar from flowers and hills far away basking in the sunlight. It was probably my best walk during the entire trip.
 
But that happiness suddenly disappeared. After lunch at Bayeli, the gruelling downhill walk started. What was better was the trail. We walked on a wideish path along the forest and met a few sheepherders. But soon, the trail got worse as the jungle kept getting denser and the trail to Dhan Kharka got narrower and worse.
The trail kept on going up and downhill crossing waterfalls after which narrow uphills began. What made it irritating was lack of trail marks, which was why I had to look for boot and trekking pole marks to ensure I was going on the right path. Add leeches to the trail and now you have a walk which will surely creep a lot of trekkers.
Trail to Bayeli Kharka from Dobato.
When I saw Dhan Kharka from afar, my happiness was beyond everything. I had made it. My mates had reached the place an hour earlier and were quite worried if I was lost. They were just as happy to see me as I was happy to see Dhan Kharka.
Our plan was to go to Khopra, but due to congestion, we were advised to stay at Dhan Kharkha also known as Chistibung. The lodge owners there were quite nice and always smiling but the food was crap. I don’t think I’ve ever eaten such disgusting food. However, their hospitality made up for the food. After chatting with the lodge owners sitting in the kitchen, we called it a night.
Day 4
Dhan Kharka to Khopra and back
Whenever I recall that day, all I want to do is punch Chitra Pun. Ranjan wanted to go to Khayer Lake so we started at 6 am. He was up there before 8 am followed by me who reached there around 8:30. But Harman was nowhere to be seen. He had overtaken me as soon as we started climbing but he hadn’t reached the top. We were worried. “Surely he lost his way,” said Ranjan. But there wasn’t anywhere to get lost. The trail was quite bad but it was relatively easy as it was mostly uphill for nearly 90 minutes, after which it got quite flat.
Trail to Khopra Danda
After waiting for two hours, we were thinking of heading down but then Harman arrived. He told us that he got lost on the way while trying a shortcut. We were extremely relieved. But he was disappointed that we were not allowed to stay there.
However, before we got back, Pun said, “No hard feelings. It’s just the way it is.” He told us that they could not give rooms to the domestic tourists as they spend less and make more noises.
Dhaulagiri seen from Khopra Danda
Disappointed by his attitude, we went back to Dhan Kharka, where Harman said we should stay an extra day. As I’d walked more in two days than I had in the past two months, I didn’t complain as I could rest for a day. We stayed at Dhan Kharka, drinking and talking to fellow trekkers who too had been denied a place at Khopra. None of us liked Chitra Pun. We met a boy who’d come from Ghorepani who had heard about Pun’s antics as well. “The lodge manager at Ghorepani told me that Pun is an ass. Your stories prove that,” he told us as we looked at the stars on a clear night sky.
I swear I had never seen so many stars. It just made that day in Dhan Kharka even better.

Day 5
Dhan Kharka to Ghorepani
Another 10-km day! So we started early. We were told that the trail wasn’t hard; that was a relief. I and Ranjan headed towards Ghorepani while Harman went towards Khopra. He was going to have a long day.
The first stretch from Dhan Kharka to Swanta was easy. Some uphill, but it was mostly easy downhill until you reached a hydropower project site, surrounded by marijuana plants. The trail then moved through a jungle with a narrow path that had nettle plants on both sides. Some said the walk was scary but I thought it was calm, walking through the jungle. In no time, we reached Swanta where I and Ranjan settled down for our first proper meal since Ghandruk.

After a proper chicken dinner, we started our walk towards Ghorepani. The locals told us the walk was easy but we didn’t find it easy. Walking through more narrow paths through jungles, we reached Chitre after which the gruelling walk towards Ghorepani began. I could see the place from a distance but it was always that bit further. Gasping for breath slowly, I eventually reached the place and we picked a hotel and called it a day.
The first thing both of us did was a hot shower after nearly a week. Then, we waited for Harman whose last message had come from Swanta.
After waiting for nearly four hours, Harman arrived. He looked exhausted. But he also looked relieved when he saw us. As soon as he came, so did the rain and that came as a relief as walking such an uphill in the rain would be a mammoth task even for him.
Thundershower meant the place also didn’t have lights so we called it an early night as we’d thought we might have gone to Poon Hill the next day.
Day 6
Walking through misty forests
Ghorepani to Ulleri
The next morning Ranjan called us out asking if we were going to Poon hill. But none of us were bothered. We’d been to Khopra which had similar views and Poon Hill could be done another time. We had a good night’s sleep and headed towards Ulleri from where we hoped to get on a jeep.
The trail to Ulleri was all downhill. It was quite easy. I’d call it the easiest day. After four days of walking such ridiculous trails, this one I felt was a piece of cake.
It took us three hours to get to Ulleri, where we had to bargain for a jeep which took Rs 1,000 to Nayapul. We had no choice so gave him that. From Nayapul, we found a jeep to Pokhara, where were spent the night before coming back to Kathmandu.

It took 400 million years for Earth to evolve. The epic journey was tough, grueling and harrowing for both humans and the denizens of the wild. The biggest challenge for the animal kingdom has, however, been the hominoids—the ‘thinking ape’ as they are sometimes referred to.
 If the evolutionary history of the early primates is to be dug up, the earliest known ancestors of modern-day elephants came 65 million years ago, long before the birth of Homo sapiens in the Paleolithic Stone Age, 2.5 million years ago. The humans came, and the ‘rape’ began. Untold species and numbers of our pre-historic elephants, the rightful early settlers of this planet, were pushed to extinction.
 My first encounter with wild elephants took place at Sainabar in the Bardia Forest, far-west Nepal. I ran into a herd of 12/13 wild elephants foraging in the woods right next to the road on the Mahendra Highway. I was on my way back to Thakurdwara after a day’s fishing at the Babai River.

As elephants are rarely seen in the wild, I was very excited at the prospect of taking some photos at such close quarters. I stopped my motorbike some 20 yards from the herd. But no sooner had I trained the camera on the herd when my guide Sitaram Choudhary, riding pillion, panicked.
I lost my balance, and we nearly toppled over. “Sir, we better not stop here . . . it’s not safe. They can attack anytime, and if they do, we don’t stand the slimmest chance,” he blurted into my ears. I somehow managed a few hurried shots.
As I kicked my motorbike into life, the herd saw us dawdling on the roadside. I saw some commotion amidst the group. Suddenly, one of the elephants, its ears pinned back, turned sharply towards us and charged. As we sped off, I turned back to look. The rushing primate had stopped after a few paces but kept eyeing us suspiciously.
Back at the lodge in Thakurdwara, my guide Sitaram unabashedly admitted that he was all set to abandon me and dash for the nearest woods—the only safe thing to do when being chased by a wild elephant, he said—had I dilly-dallied a little longer. For me, born and bred in the city, the revelation that elephants in the wild could be so dangerous came as a total shock.

Status: endangered        
In 1986, IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) declared the Asian elephant as endangered and listed it on the IUCN Red List. Over the last three generations, the population of Asiatic elephants has declined by at least 50 per cent.  And the outcome can be past hope in another 60 years. This legendary mammal may vanish from the ‘third planet from the Sun,’ the Mother Earth.
Violent
Elephants can be unpredictable. Even captive elephants, which appear very gentle to people, can deceptively turn violent and even turn upon viciously on humans. Untold incidents of unsuspecting people being killed or maimed by domesticated elephants in India and Nepal make the headlines once in a while.
On the other hand, wild elephants are thoroughly aggressive and are notorious for attacking humans on sight.  It’s no secret that in defence, the matriarch African wild elephant can turn into a formidable adversary and fear none—not even the lord of the jungle. They are known to charge into a den of lions when it comes to defending their calves.

Human-Elephant Conflict
Every year, the havoc wrought by wild elephants in Nepal make the headlines on the tabloid press.  “Tuskers kill five in east Nepal”, “Wild elephants create havoc in Dang”, “Two trampled to death in Jhapa”, “Crops destroyed in Bardia” make news stories that are depressing and sad to read. But it is a brutal fact that every year during harvest time of corn and paddy, wild elephants in the east or west on the Nepal plains (Terai) go on the rampage.
People lose their hard-earned crops, livestock, property, and at times, even their lives. For both, the humans and the elephants, it’s a harrowing experience.
The reason for these sporadic outbreaks of savagery by wild elephants is, however, not far to seek. In truth, they have been deprived of their natural habitat and driven out of their homes. And the violence has stemmed from the long-drawn-out injustice meted out to them.
An endearing moment: mother cow and calf. Image: author
The tuskers, who once freely roamed the abundant Terai forest, have had their habitat encroached upon, fragmented and destroyed by humans. Farmers have arbitrarily laid claim to what was once their home turf.
While it took eons for the pristine forests to take shape, human greed for more land led to massive destruction of these jungles, forcing wild elephants now to trespass on human habitation.

Status
The status of wild elephants in Nepal is far from satisfactory. The National Park and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973 accorded them a protected status. Categorized as an endangered species by IUCN, the World Conservation Union under CITES lists them in Appendix I.
As with the entire Indian sub-continent, and continental Southeast Asia, the reasons behind the dramatic decline of Asiatic elephants in Nepal, too, are much the same. The human-elephant conflict has taken a nasty turn.
If the elephant raids end up in the destruction of property, loss of livelihood and even human lives, elephants, in human retaliation, fall prey to poisoning, electrocuting and shooting. Worst hit is the villages and buffer zones (the immediate areas inhabited by humans surrounding the national parks and reserves).

Habitat loss, depletion of forestland for human settlement, agriculture and development work, hunting for ivory, illicit logging, excessive collection of fodder and firewood, and to some extent, capturing for domestication are the many causes.
In Africa, the modus operandi of slaughtering elephants in the wild reached an all-time high when cyanide was used. In 2013, “poachers killed 300 elephants in Zimbabwe’s Hwange National Park by poisoning their water supply and salt licks.”
Deforestation
Nepal’s massive deforestation was brought about by the Malaria Eradication Program in the 1950s, which also triggered a mass exodus of hill people to the fertile plains. This was followed by the Terai resettlement scheme in the 1960s, implementation of the Land Reform Program in 1979, and the infrastructure development work like the Mechi to Mahakali, Mahendra East-West Highway. All brought in their wake massive destruction of forests—the haven for wild elephants.
From 1950 to 1980, Nepal has lost almost half of its forest cover. In the 1990s, the lush primary forests vanished at a rate of 200 hectares a day (1.7% annually in the Terai plains), precipitating grave ecological and climatic changes.
On the Run
It has taken 400 million years for the planet Earth that we live on today to evolve—an epic journey, a formidable challenge, tough, grueling and harrowing for both humans and the denizens of the wild. The biggest challenge for the animal kingdom, as always, has, however, been the hominoids—the ‘thinking ape’ as they are sometimes referred to.
If the evolutionary history of the early primates is to be dug up, the earliest known ancestors of modern-day elephants came 65 million years ago, long before the birth of Homo sapiens in the Paleolithic Stone Age, 2.5 million years ago. The humans came, and the ‘rape’ began; untold species and numbers of our pre-historic elephants, the rightful early settlers of this planet, were pushed to extinction.

Enjoying no more than a ‘refugee’ status today, always on the run, the impending doom for the wild elephants still lurks somewhere near the surface. According to Dr. Dinesh Neupane, every year, two to three elephants succumb to retaliatory actions by local communities.
“We have always been very fond of elephants, but because of our deeds, this creature is disappearing. So far, all conservation and management plans are about confining them to protected areas. We have not been able to admit that we have encroached on their lands,” says Dinesh Bhuju, General Secretary at the Resources Himalaya Foundation.
Once just an innocent Denizen of the jungle, is, today, considered a liability. And it’s one of life’s little ironies that the so-called Homo sapiens—who were the cause of all the sufferings, worse, the extinction of one of the earth’s rarest inhabitants—are supposed to referee the remedies today!   

We had 350 known species of elephants—only two remain today—yet still—threatened. Are we to look away when the stark truth stares us in the face? Are we to take that the last vestiges of these pre-historic hairy mammoths, too, are fated to turn into lifeless stony fossils like their extinct ancestors?

Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba has said his party will be ready to field its candidate for the speaker’s election if the ruling Nepal Communist Party fails to find one from the party.
The main opposition party leader’s statement comes after the ruling party failed to find a candidate for the position, apparently owing to internal disputes in the party. Due to the party’s indecision about picking the candidate, the meeting of the House of Representatives has been put off repeatedly in the past month.
Hence, Deuba calls the ruling party to stop holding the House hostage.
Speaking with journalists in Biratnagar on Wednesday, the former prime minister clarified that his party was for endorsing the Millennium Challenge Corporation agreement from Parliament as soon as possible.

The National Assembly is currently discussing a new draft law, which, if implemented, will allow local and provincial governments also to impose penalties and fines on offences regarding administrative affairs except those related to the criminal law.
As the constitution has assigned the sub-national governments to govern various issues such as education and health, the new law will allow the respective governments to introduce provisions of penalties and fines in the laws to be formulated to govern the sectors. The Legislation Management Committee in the Upper House recently made an agreement regarding this.
In the draft of the bill regarding interrelation among the federation, province and local units, the federal government, however, had said the local and provincial governments would not be allowed to formulate any law that involves imprisonment. “But now, the provincial governments can introduce such provisions within their jurisdiction,” the committee’s secretary Manoj Kumar Giri informs.

US private equity firm Silver Lake acquiring a stake in the City Football Group (CFG), owners of English Premier League football team Manchester City, is a stunning development. Based in California, the investor has taken a 10% share in CFG for £380 million, valuing the group at almost £4 billion. Headlines have inevitably hailed the deal as one that makes Manchester City the world’s most valuable football club.
There is no doubt that the east Manchester outfit is a much more valuable asset than it was just over a decade ago. When current owner Sheikh Mansour (a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family) bought Manchester City in 2008, he paid £210 million.
But valuing football clubs is not necessarily a precise science, as the proliferation of valuation rankings demonstrates. At the same time, CFG is not just Manchester City alone. It is a group of clubs and related commercial activities that has been built up across the world.
So to imply that City is the world’s most valuable club is slightly disingenuous. Nevertheless, the punt that Silver Lake has just taken on CFG reveals a great deal about the trajectory its business is on.
The Disney of sport
Nearly 20 years ago the group’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, was vice president and finance director of Spain’s FC Barcelona. During his spell there, Soriano spoke of his vision to build a football club in the image of the Walt Disney empire.
He foresaw the convergence of entertainment and sport in a globalising world. And he also highlighted the role that franchising could play in football, along with the contribution that merchandise could make to club revenues.
Fast forward several years and by 2012 Soriano was in charge at CFG. Released from the political constraints of working for Barcelona (where board members are elected by fans, known as “socios”) and instead underwritten by the petrodollars of Abu Dhabi, the Catalan business leader was given the resources and autonomy to transform the organisation.
Since then, CFG has established franchise clubs around the world, including the US, Australia, Japan, Spain, and Uruguay. Latest news also indicates that CFG are on the verge of acquiring a club in Mumbai, India. No surprise that the city has a sizeable community of football fans, but is also the spiritual home of Bollywood and a focal point for India’s tech sector.
In 2015, CFG’s financial and political fortunes were further boosted as a Chinese investor took a stake in the business. Tellingly, the deal was announced during Chinese president Xi Jinping’s visit to the UK, during which he met then prime minister David Cameron and all manner of football, business and political deals were agreed.
So it was no surprise when, earlier this year, CFG announced plans to establish a Chinese club franchise (in Chengdu). At the same time, Abu Dhabi announced that its state airline Etihad (Manchester City’s shirt and stadium sponsor) would be enhancing its links with Chengdu’s airport. At CFG, football is often the means to an end, not just an end in itself.

No Mickey Mouse pursuit
Many of these deals were overseen by Soriano who, in the midst of it all, was also closely monitoring and responding to technological changes. Notwithstanding his original Disney vision, the nature of the movie, broadcasting and sport industries has changed dramatically over the last decade – meaning that football and entertainment are no longer Mickey Mouse pursuits.
New digital platforms have emerged, streaming has taken hold and content generation has become the fuel adding impetus to a new industrial revolution. Indeed, CFG has already taken advantage of this through, for instance, the development of its Cityzens platform and the club’s involvement in the Amazon TV series All or Nothing.
The investment made by Silver Lake in CFG is a clear acknowledgement that football is a globally compelling product, a superb source of content, and a basis upon which shrewd business people can make a profit. More importantly, as if further evidence was needed, it marks the latest move in a convergence of sport, entertainment and digital technology.
With Ferran Soriano providing his foresight and strategy, and Sheikh Mansour providing the money and politics of a wealthy new state seeking its place in the world, Silver Lake is set to bring entrepreneurial zeal and a strong track record of successful tech investments. This should help CFG, and more specifically the various franchises within the group, to establish a competitive advantage over their football rivals.
As such, CFG is at the apex of what it means to be a 21st century football business – a mixture of money, entertainment, technology and politics. Clubs like Red Bull Salzburg and Leipzig are following their own franchise path, while a growing number of teams across Europe have had fly-on-the-wall documentary series made about them. Bayern Munich and Real Madrid take their digital footprints very seriously, while French champions Paris Saint Germain has a Qatari owner.
It is currently only CFG that brings everything together in one place, however. And it is on this basis that Silver Lake has invested in what was once a football club with historic roots in the working class communities of east Manchester, but is now a global entertainment business catapulted to the top of the football’s valuation charts.

Globally renowned economic magazine, The Economist, has forecast that Nepal’s economic growth rate will be 6.9 per cent the next year.
The magazine, in its The World in 2020 issue released last week, claims that Nepal’s growth will be faster than India, which will have a growth rate of 6.7 per cent. However, it will be slower than the growth of Bangladesh, predicted to be at the rate of 7.7 per cent.
The magazine has listed Nepal in the eighth position among the fastest 10 growers that include Bangladesh, Nepal and India from the South Asian region.
Though the listing among the fastest growers seems encouraging, the magazine’s forecast is lower than the government target. The government had set a target of 8.5 per cent economic growth in its annual budget plan for the current fiscal year. Earlier this month, the government revised the target and made it 7.01 per cent.

Kathmandu, November 25
New statistics have shown that Nepal is the third biggest source of education income for Australia, after China and India.
Australian Education Minister Dan Tehan informed last week that international education contributed 37.6 billion Australian dollars to the Australian economy last financial year, which was a $5 billion increase.
According to the ministry’s report, Nepal is the third-largest contributor to the education income as it provided 2.6 billion Australian dollars to the country. The two biggest contributors are China and India (12.1 billion and 5.5 billion Australian dollars respectively).
As per the current exchange rate, the amount Nepalis paid to Australia is around Rs 202.8 billion. It is around 13 per cent of the country’s annual budget for the current fiscal year (Rs 1.532 trillion).
Of late, Australian universities are lowering their standard to attract more Nepali and Indian students, according to media reports. However, the minister claims in his press release, “Australians should be proud of our innovative international education sector… It is our largest service-based export and supports 240,000 jobs, business opportunities and economic growth.”

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hong-xiang-restaurant-review-not-as-good-as-hype.html,"The restaurant also serves some good noodle dishes
As Chinese President Xi Jinping left Kathmandu after a hyped two-day visit recently, I had a sudden urge to try Chinese food. After being disappointed with Chinese eateries in Thamel, I really wanted to try some good Chinese food. However, after having lunch at Hong Xiang Restaurant in Baneshwor, I felt the restaurant was not less hyped than the President’s trip. Also, the menu was a tad overpriced.
Hong Xiang isn’t solely a restaurant. It’s a hotel that hosts a lot of Chinese tourists. The restaurant basically caters to these tourists. However, over the past few years, it has also been getting many Nepali customers.
Even though I was there around lunchtime, the restaurant was pretty empty. The place is quite spacious with huge round tables which made it evident that it gets a lot of groups. But the place doesn’t have tables for two people. If it’s getting so many people, maybe the tables for two should also be the restaurant’s priority. Décor-wise, the place is quite bland too. While many Chinese restaurants make you feel you’re in China, this one didn’t have that feeling. Its got some huge posters of Chinese destinations, but apart from that and the round tables, you might feel that you are in an Indian restaurant.
The menu was quite vast too. It had a wide range of hot and cold starters along with a good range of vegetarian and fish options as well. But what was a bit disappointing was the food items did not have descriptions which makes it hard for us Nepalis to figure out what would actually come out. Another problem with the place was it did not have a POS machine; if you’re going there make sure you take sufficient cash.

The first dish I tried was the Sichuan-style fried chicken. The dish with sticky rice was full of flavour. It was a bit sour, pungent and a spicy and had a distinct aroma to it. It was quite ideal for a Nepali tastebud. I’d say it had the perfect blend of Sichuan peppers and spices. Definitely worth a try.

The second dish I tried was the hot buff with black mushrooms. The dish was huge. I was quite disappointed that the waiter didn’t tell us that the dish was for more than two people. It feels like they aren’t trained and need to communicate better with their customers. Taste-wise, it was alright. But I think the dish was way too spicy. The buff meat was decent as black mushrooms added some nice flavour to the dish, but the overuse of Sichuan peppers and dried chilly just wouldn’t let you enjoy the meat. The broth with which the food came was quite nice; if it was a bit less spicy, people would actually like to enjoy it. If you really like spicy food, you can try it, but only if in a group. The dish can be enough for up to four people, easily.
Even though I wanted to try more items, the buff dish killed my appetite and I called it a day.
Overall, I think the place is average. There are a lot of places which serve such food for a more reasonable price. Most of the starters were above Rs 700 as were the mains. Many small Chinese eateries in Thamel definitely serve you the same food for a relatively reasonable price.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/poi-paryo-kale-movie-review-though-fictitious-and-exaggerated-this-movie-is-a-fun-watch.html,"
Looking at the title of this week’s Kollywood release, you might not want to go watch Poi Paryo Kale. Many people consider the term ‘Poi’ (which means ‘husband’) derogatory whereas the entire title suggests the movie is a cheap comedy that includes a lot of racism and skin-colour shaming as a medium of making the audience laugh. The initial few minutes of the movie do not change your expectations.
While you are yet to figure out the opening scene, the narrator tells you a boring story–a black nurse took care of a girl when she was born, later a black boy pushed her into a hole and a series of over a dozen sentences, each using the word ‘black’.
But, wait till the second half and you will find the movie a fun game, with a clear social message, though the plot is essentially fictitious.
Parody of colourism
Tolerate the ‘torture’ of the first few minutes; then the movie will free you from your fear that it makes fun of someone’s skin colour to make you laugh. Rather, the movie turns out to be a parody; it attacks the narrow-mindedness of people who do not like the black-skinned just because of the colour. The exaggerated narrative about the girl’s birth and childhood also gets justified here because parodies, by nature, are exaggerated.

This movie clarifies that exaggerations do not necessarily mean something negative. In artworks, portraying an exaggerated situation can improve the effectiveness of communications. The lead character of the movie Puja Sharma (it is the name shared by the actress and her role in the movie) not only hates black people and things, but she also cries so loudly in the very beginning ‘I hate black.’ It makes the movie easily comprehensible to everyone.
As the movie progresses, the parody gradually develops into a lesson that hating people on the basis of colour is nonsensical. This part is also exaggerated and beyond what you could imagine having existed in reality, but it is capable enough of imparting the intended lesson via a unique plot.
Unusual plot
You can sense the unusualness of the movie’s plot as you see ‘Madhyantar’ (Intermission) on the screen a couple of minutes after the curtains open. But the movie does not give you any second to think about what happened as you overhear the unseen narrator (Kedar Ghimire). He clarifies that the audience needs to learn about what happened before the first scene to call it the intermission. Then the movie goes into flashback. It continues till the intermission.
Because the exaggeration is over the top, you might find the first half boring. However, the second half improves because it involves a drama that you have never imagined. This is also an exaggeration but it is interesting to see characters of a film orchestrating another drama inside the story. It feels that Poi Paryo Kale is a metafictional work that shows you how artists create stories out of their ordinary life.

Because of the genre, you know how the movie ends–satires generally expose the truth and teach the characters a lesson at the end, leaving them disillusioned. But still, the movie is capable of keeping the audience hooked as you still do not know how exactly Puja learns her lesson. On the other hand, the impacts of her shortsightedness in the drama inside the movie are too imminent, and you wonder how she will avoid that.
If the screenwriter Shishir Rana had made the plot more realistic while retaining the unusualness, it would have been really a powerful story.
Acting and cinematography
Despite the loose story, the movie has not deviated from the focus, mainly because the key actors have given justice to their roles. Puja Sharma has been given an emotionally tumultuous role in the movie, but she has done faultless acting here. In fact, the entire movie is her journey from an illusion to disillusionment and she handles it quite well. Saugat Malla looks too gentle, perfect for his role as an orphaned but rich young businessman.
Aakash Shrestha also deserves some appreciation in the movie because he has tried a different role this time. In his previous movies, he was shown as an idealistic lover; but here he is a carefree and mischievous young man. He seems improving, but not polished yet. Shristi Shrestha is okay as an urban girl, but she has failed to make an impression.

Veteran comedian Rajaram Poudel had bored his audience with cheap jokes and confusing multiple roles in some of his recent projects including Dal Bhat Tarkari, Jatrai Jatra and Na Yeta Na Uta. He has improved this time and been able to make the audience laugh, logically. Screenwriter and director Rana and comedian Gopal Dhakal ‘Chhande’ have done justice to their roles. Experienced Surakshya Panta has been given a minor role in this movie; she has not been able to contribute as much as what she could.
As a director, Rana’s job is average because the movie, overall, is a mediocre project from the cinematographic perspective. Taking the help of an unseen narrator to connect different times suggests the director’s failure to establish the connection visually. On the other hand, he has failed to differentiate the scenes that actually happen and what Puja fears could happen. For example, an overthinking Puja fears that her domestic workers can tell her friends who her husband is before she introduces him to them, it does not happen; but the audience gets confused as there is nothing to suggest that this is just a hallucination.
Meanwhile, he has not made sincere efforts in the making of supportive characters. For example, most of the friends who act Puja’s friends do not look natural.

Verdict
Poi Paryo Kale is not a polished work. However, director Shishir Rana seems to have improved from his directorial debut Timi Sanga; at least he has made a better movie than veteran Ashok Sharma’s Rato Tika Nidharma. (The movies are comparable because they belong to the same genres.)
While retaining the strengths of his story and moviemaking such as a unique plot and coverage of neglected issues, he needs to improve on reducing overdramatisation and connecting the story to real life.

They are “powerful, sentient, intelligent, sensitive, naughty, playful, emotional, perceptive, resilient, intuitive, compassionate, intimidating, curious, complex, and loyal to the bone.” Jaws drop. Heads turn. People freeze in their tracks. Kids scamper up chortling with delight as this hulking figure lumbers by majestically.
The 12th of August, every year, is dedicated to this largest terrestrial mammal on this planet: the elephant. The day marks the World Elephant Day. Let us also devote a little of our time and get to know this gargantuan ‘wonder’ a little closer.
Obedient and Intelligent 
For their unwieldy size and a deceptively meek bearing, the elephants belie their intelligence to a phenomenal level. Whether in the zoo, or a safari in one of our National Parks, it lets you ride on its back . . . so docile and obedient like a child. If you have visited Chitwan National Park, you must have had this experience.

Give some bananas to a park-owned elephant, and it gently tugs at your sleeve with its flailing trunk for some more. That leaves you thrilled to the core. One word, a nudge from the mahout, and it lowers itself down to its knees, lets you climb up its trunk onto its back, or perform such tricks as standing on its hind legs or folding its enormous forelegs in a show of respect.
Once, while on an elephant ride in the Chitwan National Park, I dropped my camera-lens cover to the ground. No sweat! The mahout stopped the elephant, prodded it a little on its flanks by his feet and barked out some words. Lo and behold, the gentle giant gingerly picked it up with its prehensile trunk and handed it back to the mahout! I was tickled to the bone!

Curiously, African forest elephants have two finger-like growths at their trunk tips. Their Asian cousins have only one. Called the proboscides, they work like our fingers and help them grasp food and other tiniest of objects.
Whether it is performing amazing circus feats, playing polo, soccer or even painting colourful pictures on an easel, this colossal ‘beast of burden’ has proven its mettle all over the world.
Sensitive and emotional
Of all the wild animals in the world, elephants, or ‘pachyderms’ are said to be the most sensitive by nature—nothing less than humans. Did you know that they play, cry, and . . . laugh, too?
They are so susceptible that if a baby calf, the cynosure of the herd so much as whines, the entire family, ill at ease, rushes over to nuzzle and caress it. Their display of respect and empathy for every family member is exemplary. When a lost member reunites with the herd, it is greeted by the rest with benign affability.
When talking about feelings and emotions, the elephants have, by far, an edge over other animals, domesticated or wild. If a calf is stillborn, if any member of the herd is in distress, or when death strikes one of the family members—they grieve like humans.

Legendary memory
They are said to have a legendary memory. “You might know 200 people. Well, an elephant might know 500 or 1000 elephants. It’s got to remember every single one of those to get along well with its friends. So yes, elephants have fabulous memories, and this is one of the things that makes them so special,” writes, elephant ecologist Stephen Blake.
An Icon
For millenniums, elephants evoked a sense of awe in human beings. More so culturally in Asia.  Elephant lore is plentiful. To the followers of Hinduism, this creature identifies itself as the best known and the most widely worshipped deity in the Hindu pantheon, Ganesha or Ganpati. If you care to observe, you will run into a Ganesh idol or a temple virtually at every Kathmandu Street—virtually every nook and corner.
A Ganesh idolImage: author
Part human, part elephant, the son of Lord Shiva and Parvati, Ganesha is invoked by all as the icon of intellect and wisdom, a patron of arts, lord of success and sciences, and destroyer of evils. The great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, vividly relates great battles fought and won with elephants as war vehicles.
To one and all, the women folks and kids more so, the sight of a domesticated elephant evokes awe, respect, affection, and deep veneration as it is identified with God Ganesha. People even touch it devoutly as it lumbers by.
Overview
African vs. Asian
Elephants are near-ungulates. They have toenails rather than hooves. The word elephant that has its roots in Latin comes from two words: ‘ele’ meaning arch and ‘phant’ meaning huge.
Among several species of pre-historic elephants, only the following genera are found today—the African elephant (Loxodonta Africana): the African Bush or also called Savannah elephant (Loxodonta Africana Africana), the African Forest elephant (Loxodonta Africana Cyclotis), and the Asiatic elephant (Elephas Maximus): the Indian elephant (Elephas Maximus Indicus), the Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas Maximus Maximus), and the Borneo pygmies (Elephas Maximus Borneensis).
The largest recorded elephant in the world lived for 82 years and was shot in Angola in 1956. It was the largest and weighed 12,000 kilograms (26,455 lbs.), and was, 4.2 m (14 ft.) tall at the shoulder.

Very similar at first glance, African and Asiatic elephants differ anatomically. Sway backed and with a tapering head, the African elephant bears larger ears that are oddly similar to the shape of the African Continent.
The Asiatic elephant, on the other hand, is smaller than its African counterpart, is hump-backed, holds a huge domed head and bears smaller ears that curiously match the shape of the Indian Continent.
Unlike the African elephants who bear tusks(proboscis) regardless of gender, only the Asiatic bull elephants bearlarge external tusks; females have only ‘tushes’: incisors that stick out beyond the upper lip. They have five toes on the front feet and four on the back, unlike their African cousins, which have four on the front and only three on the back.
The African elephants can weigh as much as 10 to 12 tons and measure 12 to 13 ft. whereas their Asian relatives weigh from 2½ to 5 tons and measure 9 to 10 ft. in height at the shoulder.
Both Asiatic and African bulls are almost twice the size of their adult female partner. The gestation period for an Asiatic elephant is between 19 and 22 months (a little longer for the African). Both species breed at the age of 15 years and bear offspring (normally one) up to 50 years. Their life expectancy is very similar to humans – 60 to 70 years, or more.
During one of my visits to the Chitwan National Park, a game scout at the jungle lodge I was staying in, demonstrated an ingenious way of estimating the height of an elephant by measuring the circumference of its footprint and multiplying it by two. Everyone at the camp was thrilled!

Distribution
African bush elephants: Tropical rainforests of West and Central Africa. African savannah elephants: Eastern and southern Africa (Botswana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia).
Asiatic elephants: The Indian sub-continent (Nepal, India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh); continental Southeast Asia (China, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Kampuchea, Malaysia and Vietnam); and Asian islands (Andaman, Sri Lanka, Sumatra, and Borneo).
Behaviour
Matriarchal by behaviour, elephants, both African and Asiatic, live in a group of structural social order made up of mothers, daughters, sisters, and aunts. Such groups are led by the eldest females. Adult males mostly live solitary lives.
World Population
More than 100,000 Asian elephants may have existed at the start of the 20th century, but numbers have fallen by at least 50% over the last three generations, and they are still on the decline today.
In the late 1930s, African elephants numbered nearly 10 million; dropped disastrously to 1.3 million in the late 1970s and 600,000 in the late 1980s. Never abundant as their African cousins, and even more endangered, Asiatic elephants find their origin in the mammoth (Mammuthus), now extinct.
Asiatic Elephant
In 2016, wildlife experts estimated that Africa’s elephant population had dropped by 111,000 elephants in a decade. Today, there are just 415,000 elephants (WWF) across the African Continent.
At the turn of the 20th century, the population of the Asian elephant was estimated to be 200,000 (approx.). Today, there are fewer than 60,000 of which 38 to 53 thousand are found in the wild, 14 to 15 thousand are domesticated, and a thousand are scattered around zoos.
The number of resident wild elephants in Nepal was estimated to be between 109 and 142 animals (occurring in Eastern, Central, and Far-western region. DNPWC 2008).  Some experts believe the figure fluctuates from 100 to 170 as transboundary migration to India takes place at Terai borders. The total number of elephants in captivity stands at 170.
“If you’re not outraged, then I beg you to take a little time just learn about elephants… They’re worth fighting for and we owe it to them to protect them,” Ellen DeGeneres.

Kathmandu, December 9
Though the ruling Nepal Communist Party is yet to begin formal discussions on electing the new speaker in the House of Representatives after the resignation of Krishna Bahadur Mahara in October, insiders believe the leadership must be thinking about some possible names.
Before the Cabinet reshuffle last month, the party’s chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal had demanded that the position be held by a leader of the former CPN-Maoist Centre side, but another chairman, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, had reportedly rejected the proposal. The prime minister instead wants to see his confidant and four-time House leader Subas Chandra Nembang as the speaker again, a source close to the discussion between the two chairs had revealed.
So, will Nembang become the speaker yet again?
In a brief conversation with Onlinekhabar, Nembang refuses to clearly comment on the issue but hints that he is ready to shoulder the responsibility if the party decides so.
“Instead of making personal claims, I wish the parties and Parliament could elect a lawmaker as the speaker who can meet needs of the House and the country,” a diplomatic Nembang says, “I do not want to make any comment.”
He also reveals that the party leadership has asked him not to say anything about the issue publicly. “The leaders told me the party and Parliament would decide. They said, ‘Why do you make comments? We do whatever we need to do. Please do not speak anything’.”
After repeatedly asked if he is ready to become the speaker again, Nembang says, “If such a situation comes, let’s discuss this issue at the right time and reach an appropriate conclusion.”",/political,"Mon, 09 Dec 2019 06:15:02 +0000"

Kathmandu, December 8
Around three weeks after he was appointed the ‘executive’ chairman of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is revitalising all units of the party at all levels.
Though it has already been more than one year since the then CPN-UML and the CPN-Maoist Centre announced their merger to form the NCP, the party is yet to form various committees. Among the already formed committees, many are yet to function properly.
The nine-member secretariat has been taking decisions about major issues whereas it has been months since the standing committee and the central committee held their meetings. The politburo is yet to be formed.
Likewise, the party has appointed chiefs for 32 internal departments but they are yet to get the full shape. Many sister organisations have not been unified.
In this context, Dahal wants to complete all the tasks related to the unification as soon as possible and launch a nationwide cadre mobilisation campaign, according to sources close to him.
As the first preparatory step, he is likely to call a standing committee meeting. The secretariat meeting scheduled for Monday is expected to fix the standing committee meeting date, according to the party leader Devendra Paudel, who recently met Dahal.
On the eve of the secretariat meeting, Dahal met Madhav Kumar Nepal, Ishwar Pokharel and Bishnu Paudel today to discuss the agenda.",/political,"Sun, 08 Dec 2019 06:06:37 +0000"

The NCP retained the House of Representatives seat in Kaski-2 and the Provincial Assembly seat in Dang 3(B). However, it lost the previously won Provincial Assembly seat of Bhaktapur 1(A). With the NCP’s support, Rastriya Janamorcha retained the Provincial Assembly seat in Baglung 2(B).
The NCP could not retain the mayoral leadership in Dharan city as the Nepali Congress candidate Tilak Rai defeated the NCP’s Prakash Rai.

Alex Bescoby is an award-winning British filmmaker and TV presenter based in Yangon, Myanmar. He studied politics and history at Cambridge University and has spent much of the last decade working, exploring and living in Southeast Asia. Bescoby has a passion for Land Rovers stretching back to childhood, having long idolised The First Overland Expedition. The First Overland – made history in 1955 by being the first to drive from London to Singapore. That young team inspired generations of adventurers through their extraordinary endeavour, showing many remote corners of the world on film for the first time.
Driving the original 1955 Series One Land Rover (‘Oxford’), Bescoby and an experienced team are remaking history for a new generation of adventurers. This time, the team will forge the path through some of the densest jungles, highest mountains and most arid deserts on the planet, returning the car from Singapore to London.
Currently, Bescoby is in Nepal part of the Last Overland expedition where he along with his team are driving from Singapore to London on a 64-year-old Land Rover. Onlinekhabar caught up with Bescoby and talked to him about his journey so far and what he aims to achieve through this extraordinary journey. Excerpts:
How has the journey been so far? 
It’s been amazing. I had pretty high expectations when they approached me and I have not been let down at all. It feels I’ve been doing this forever now and it’s a wonderful life. I have a wonderful team. We get up every day, meet new people, and see new places where we’ve never been to before. We also get to learn so many things every day. We eat fantastic food and often bump into landrover lovers who come out to see and speak to us just to see the car.
It has been tiring moving all the time, but it’s been a wonderful experience so far. There’s been a lot of variety so far. Roads have been good in most places but we’ve also had some really poor roads but all in all, I’d say it’s been fun.
Where have you been so far? 
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Northeast India and now Nepal. And what’s wonderful is that the way we’re travelling we’re learning new things about cross-border cultures. When you fly into a place you assume that the geographical borders are where the cultures stop. But you realise that when you cross from Thailand to Myanmar, a lot of people there speak the same language, share the same faith. Same with travelling through northeast India, we’ve seen six or seven major ethnic groups which are similar to northwest Myanmar. The past few days, we spent with people speaking Nepali and identifying themselves as Gurkhas in northeast India. That is what I’ve been finding very fascinating. When you travel by road slowly, how the different national cultures they sort of mix and blend with each other.
How long have you been on the road? 
It is a long way. We’ve been on the road for 36 days now and still have around two-and-a-half months to go. It turns out flying is a lot easier than driving from Singapore to London.
So you’re not rushing then? 
What would be the point in that? We’re not racing against anyone. We’re in an old car and want to enjoy this journey. We also want to see these incredible places and learn about new cultures because you never know when we’ll be able to travel to these places.  It would be a real shame to just drive through these wonderful places.
Photo: Grammar Productions
When do you plan to be back in London? 
Our deadline is Christmas. I think we are on track.
What was the first thing that came across your mind when you were asked to go on this journey? 
It was the opportunity of a lifetime. The pieces started to fall for the project when I started to get excited. Tim Slessor wanted to do it. The old car was available and restored. We had sponsors like the Singapore Tourism Board and Land Rover came in and told us they’d make it possible. That is when I felt this was going to be an adventure of a lifetime and I haven’t been disappointed.
How is the car? 
It’s good. Oxford is 64 years old. She has no power steering, no disk brake, no air conditioning, very very poor windscreen wipers which I have realised in the past few days. And she leaks through the roof and she’s drafty. But by god, she is fun to drive. I call her ‘she’ because Tim always called her ‘she’. He called this car the old lady.
I feel this car has a personality that you get to know gradually and that’s wonderful because this isn’t a normal car. You’re not protected from the environment. You feel the road, you feel the weather, it’s noisy and it’s hard work because you have to concentrate. It makes the journey more fun I’d say.

What advice did Tim give you before starting the journey? 
It was nice of him to come to Singapore with us. The initial plan was for him to come with us, but his health got bad so he didn’t join us. But in the build-up to that, Tim gave me some practical advice which has come in handy so far into the journey. From how to pack the cars, to how to approach scheduling and resting, how to eat how to drink. But I remember two pieces of advice the most: one was to drive fast on bumpy roads or else oxford will rattle into pieces and the other one was whatever disagreement we’d have as a team, he told us to make sure it didn’t last the day.

 What has each country taught you so far?
Well, Singapore taught me how much you can get done in 24 hours. That city is incredible. Anything you want to get done in 24 hours you can do. In Malaysia, I learned how much those people loved Land Rovers. I was absolutely blown away. In Thailand, I learned to appreciate good roads, 7/11s, good petrol stations and great food. Myanmar, where I’ve lived for many years, taught me the value of air conditioning. It was absolutely boiling there.
Northeast India blew my mind. It taught me how little I knew about India and the variety of culture and history there. Even the terrain was quite surprising. And here in Nepal nothing yet. I’ve just been here and I hope I get to learn a lot from this country too. The welcome has been amazing. We’ve been looked after by the Gurkha Welfare Trust who have been simply amazing.
Where will you be travelling around Nepal? 
Well, from Damak, we’re going to Pokhara where we’ll spend a few days. We’ll take the car to Sarangkot. After that, we’ll go to Kathmandu where we’ll prepare for our trip to China which is going to be quite tough. We’re exiting via Kerung into China which is going to be hard work. Travelling through some remote places in China, going through some of the highest roads in the world, we want to relax in Kathmandu and immerse ourselves in the festival. Looking forward to having a good time in Nepal.
What’s been your biggest challenge so far? 
I’d say the car. Just keeping the car in good condition has been a challenge. It’s been challenging to drive especially on the Indian highways where people drive on the wrong side of the road. Making sure the car is okay has been a challenge. We broke down in Darjeeling where there were a lot of Land Rover mechanics which was a lot of help. Bad roads have also been a challenge.

Has the journey been better than what you’d hoped it would be? 
Absolutely. I hadn’t expected such a good response. I had thought that we would be driving through countries and no one would care. But that has not been the case. Both the response the road and where we’re stopped has been staggering. People have given us free meals and free hotels, something which I had not imagined we would be getting. The response online has been quite amazing. Both on Facebook and Instagram.
When Tim fell ill we thought people would not be interested in our journey but we were wrong. People have absolutely loved what we’re doing so far. What we’ve realised is that the car is much a celebrity as Tim.
The route
What do you plan to achieve through this? Is this doing it for doing its sake or is there a greater calling? 
I mean there is this doing it for doing its sake in a way because the journey that Tim went on to define his life. And 64 years later, he and his friends are still talking about it.
Then another question arose – can we do it? Will the car make it? Politically can we get across borders without much trouble? We also wanted to see if the world was more dangerous than it was 64 years ago or is it safer?
Personally I wanted to investigate what had changed in the world in the past 64 years.
There are obviously bad things going around in the world, but I want to show people that on the ground level people are lovely. And I hope I inspire other people to travel slowly across countries and hope they realise that the world is a better place.
The First Overland came via Afghanistan and Syria, but you’re not taking that route. The world was more interconnected in the past, but can’t move as freely now. Comments?
We could try going through Afghanistan and Syria, but it would be stupid. We don’t want to take so many risks. What interesting about this route we’re taking now is we’ve moving freely across China and Central Asia, something the 1955 team could never do. There is no way that six Britons could drive through China and the USSR without conflicts. Just shows how the world has changed.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/angling-the-water-tigers-a-breakthrough-in-adventure-tourism.html,"“There he stood, the Mahseer of the Poonch, beside whom the Tarpon is a herring and he who catches him can say he is a fisherman.” Rudyard Kipling (Jungle Book, 1894).
Virtually, cut off from the rest of the world until the 1950s, Nepal saw the dawn of tourism after an intrepid duo set foot on this little “mythological Shangri-La” to scale the Everest. That venturous duo were Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary. At 11:30 am on May 29, 1953, the Everest was conquered . . . and world history was rewritten.
The historic event catapulted our little known country to global fame. Adventure tourism, thus, saw its birth in Nepal. With time, it diversified. After the top-draw adventure attraction of mountaineering, came trekking, followed by wildlife safari and white water rafting. Human’s hunger for more adventure, however, would not let up.
Braver diversions
Old concepts turned passé. To woo more tourists, newer concepts like ‘eco tours’, ‘green tours,’ ‘cultural tours,’ ‘soft tours,’ ‘adventure tours’ and the like heralded a revamping of the travel notion.
Soon followed braver diversions, the likes of rock climbing, canyoning, paragliding, hot air ballooning, mountain biking, bungee jumping, skydiving, zip flying—and still counting! Ski-mountaineering and ski-diving? You heard it right.  That’s another adventure notion the travel operators have tweaked into their itinerary.
Worldwide sport
Surprisingly, angling or fishing tours in Nepal still seems almost an uncharted domain, less explored and waiting to be tapped. Neighbouring India, on the other hand, has made quite a leap into this field.

Sportfishing in India has flourished substantially in the last two decades and almost every travel operator includes angling trips in their holiday itineraries. This adventure sport lures worldwide anglers to India in pursuit of the legendary Golden mahseer (tor putitora), the ultimate dream fish of every serious freshwater angler.
The popular angling destinations in India include the upper Ganges with her many tributaries in North India like the Ram Ganga (flows through the Corbett National Park), Saryu and Kali at Pancheswor, Uttarakhand, for the golden mahseer, and the river Cauvery rising in the mountainous region of Coorg in the Western Ghats in the Karnataka state, for the monster-size hump-backed mahseer.

Dedicated anglers from around the world spend fortunes to travel thousands of miles to India in pursuit of this charismatic game fish. Tours are typically booked up to a year in advance through travel agents or online.
Considering its endangered status, the Indian government has passed strict directives to release all such mahseer catches. You catch it, then gingerly hold it in your arms, weigh it, measure it, strike a pose with it for a photo, and finally release it gently back into the waters where it belongs.
Over the past few decades, the trend of tourism in Nepal has gone through a dramatic diversification, with adventure tourism taking an edge over others. Some years ago, a news item headlined “Nat Geo hails thrill-seekers’ paradise” pointed out that National Geographic identified Nepal and Brazil among the top-draw adventure destinations in the world.
This came as welcome news. Given proper promotion, angling for mahseer in our torrential snow-fed rivers tucked into the foothills of the exotic Himalayas guarantees the visitors newer horizons of virgin wilderness, adventure, and truly a fantastic angling itinerary.

In recent years, a handful of Nepali travel operators have included fishing in their itinerary.  Such trips are, however, a far cry from the organised fishing carried out by many outfitters in neighbouring India.

Owing to lack of professionalism, inadequate data and research on the aquatic life, and insufficient expertise and handling experience to back such ventures, the potential of running fishing expeditions as a full-fledge adventure destination has not been fully tapped in Nepal. More than that, for the past few decades, the legendary mahseer has had a trying time caused by human encroachment and depletion of natural resources.
Threatened    
The 2018 Living Planet Report, published every two years documented an alarming 60 per cent decline in the population of wildlife on earth, both terrestrial and aquatic. Depletion of natural biodiversity, on the other hand, threatens the planet to its brim. Human encroachment and the atrocity against wildlife on the face of the earth did not spare Nepal, too.
And today’s buzz-words ‘global warming’ and the ‘greenhouse’ gas emissions have kept the scientists on the edge of their seats since the turn of the 20th century.
Considered a national heritage by ichthyologists, the status of mahseers in Nepal is far from satisfactory. In truth, they are heavily threatened and fall under the IUCN Red List.  The causes for this are not far to seek.
Unethical killing
Yes, in the past few decades, the ‘popular’ but grossly unethical methods of fishing have only worsened to assume alarming proportions. The mahseer has fallen victim to blast-fishing, poisoning, electrofishing, and fishing during the spawning season. Rampant gill-netting with no regard for the size of the mesh (decimating mother and fingerlings both) has become a ‘joyriding’ epidemic. And to make a quick buck, people go to any length.
Doomed! Electrofishing (I’d to take this photo on the sly)
During one of my fishing trips to the Tama Koshi River, some 18 km from Dolakha, Charikot, I witnessed a scene that made my blood run cold. On seeing some commotion, curious, I approached the noisy group of locals gathered at the riverbank. Never thought people could stoop so low.
To my horror, they had a live wire strung from the high-voltage transmission line, which they shoved into the water to electrocute the fish. What nerve! Why on earth did they not realise that it was too dangerous and not only kill the fish indiscriminately but take their lives too?
Massive encroachment
“The mahseer is essentially a fish of the rocks, the rapids, and the hills,” wrote A. St. J. Macdonald in his epic book, Circumventing the Mahseer, published in 1948. No words could be truer about the Himalayan gamefish. The more untamed the river, the better is the mahseer run. They hunt and thrive in rough but clear waters with lots of gravel. Silted water proves as their worse nemesis.
What with the country’s infrastructure work at its height from construction of roads, dams to barrages and irrigation weirs, massive quarrying of rocks, gravel and sand from the river bed to natural calamities like landslides (associated with deforestation), all led to the destruction of its natural habitat and disrupted its annual migratory cycle, which is so critical for natural reproduction.
That said, as loss of biodiversity and rapid depletion of natural resources continue, lack of awareness among the riverside fishing community and total government apathy to address the problem, on the other, pose disastrous outcomes for the mahseer and other aquatic species still fighting for survival.
Freshwater monsters
Along with the mahseer, other gamefish like the river monster Goonch catfish (Bagarius yarelli), which have been known to  grow to more than nine feet weighing up to a whopping 50 to 150 kilos, and the snow trout, Asla (Schizothorax macrophthalmus), too, are under threat of extinction if the problem is not timely addressed. The goonch is regarded as a formidable quarry by anglers while fly-fishing for Himalayan snow-trout, a great sport.

The monster-size goonch has a notorious reputation of dragging fishermen into the river and eating them. Jeremy Wade, the British angler, biologist, and writer—better-known as the TV presenter of the wildlife documentary—the River Monsters—toured the world in pursuit of the giant catfish and fished our Mahakali waters in west Nepal, too.
Catch-n-release
Apart from the implementation of conservation measures, awareness among the modern-day anglers and the riverside fishing fraternity is equally important and can effectively work as a stepping stone in saving the aquatic life of our rivers from extinction.
Golden Mahseer
Little-known some two decades ago, catch-and-release among the old-hands and the budding mahseer anglers in Nepal in recent years, have shown some promise for this endangered species. Many Nepali and the visiting foreign anglers to our rivers in Nepal have started releasing their prize-catches.
This conscientious act by the anglers has to some extent sparked off a little curiosity among the local fishing community about the significance of conserving the aquatic life of their rivers. Simple curiosity is followed by an interaction with the anglers and that eventually helps shed light on the fish’s vulnerability and the threatened status to the local people.
Great potential
Given meticulous planning and customised escorted destinations, mahseer angling, as an adventure travel destination in Nepal, can surely make a major breakthrough in travel trade business. Other tour packages like wildlife safari, white water rafting, nature trekking, and bird watching can be mutually supportive, and impart further impetus to such ventures.

“Sport fishing could go a long way in conserving these fish. Anglers not only pay top dollar to land the Mahseer, which has become a legend among anglers, but will also create jobs for the poor. No doubt that protecting stretches of rivers like this is the answer. But the government must be willing,” writes an angler-conservationist, Arun Rana, for Fishing Himalayas, a website dedicated to responsible sport fishing in Nepal.

In recent years, the entry made by fly-fishing mahseer in our waters has gained growing popularity. Fishing golden mahseer on the fly is considered by anglers a bigger challenge than fishing with the conventional tackle, but believe it can match the catch ratio of the latter, no less.

First, a careful study and survey of potential mahseer waters, evaluation of the present status of our watercourses and their resident mahseer runs and informed selection of river stretches least affected by human proximity and poaching are essential.
Emulating the neighbours

Following in the footsteps of our Indian cousins, all angling operations can be managed either from fixed station riverside camps or lodges or by mounting short or long expeditions by river rafting combined with short hikes. Some guidelines to consider:
•Conduct angling trips on a day-by-day basis from established camps or lodges, located near the fishing waters. In Bardiya National Park, several resorts can work as established bases from which to fish the Karnali, Babai, Bheri and Seti rivers. The roadside town of Chisapani can also serve as a base for fishing the upper Karnali and confluences like the Karnali-Bheri and Karnali-Seti.
•Organise expeditions or customised trips with local river guides or river scouts by raft or short treks. Given proper planning, our rivers offer plenty of opportunities, both by raft or short hikes. Many rafting companies can accommodate such a schedule.
Some options are: Dolalghat/Chatara Ghat river rafting with a myriad of tributaries feeding themselves into the Sunkoshi river in the central Nepal hills or short hikes from Mulghat in east Nepal’s Dhankuta district to Tribeni along the river Tamor, or from Maibeni in east Nepal’s Bhojpur district to the confluence of the Pikhuwa and Arun rivers, or from west Nepal’s Bheri-Karnali confluence to Chisapani.
• Combine fishing packages (if close to a national park) diversified by other activities such as nature walks, elephant safaris, birdwatching, village tours, canoe rides, and the lot.

We cannot expect to develop this adventure sport unless we develop in-depth guidelines and a strategy that combines both ‘transplantation and conservation’ to revive these threatened species. It’s high time the concerned authorities took some bold and innovative strategy to save this species from being shoved into oblivion.
Nature at its best
For every visiting angler in pursuit of the awe-inspiring mahseer, there is more to it—not just the fish. The foray kicks off with the sprawling countryside, and from one moment to the next, nature accompanies him with all its bounty.
As a myriad of undulating wooded hills and awesome gorges appears, the rivers rage and crash past breaking into hundreds of churning white rapids and beautiful falls. The visitor is stumped.
As he finds himself smack dab in lush green mountain valleys, the gin-clear spring-fed headwaters meander past him to continue through the verdant subtropical jungles to pour themselves into their big cousins.
Time and again, the remote outback offers incredible sights of wildlife and sounds of nature that greet the untrained ear. Many a village crosses the trail, offering rare moments to share with the local people and observe their unique customs, beliefs and diverse ethnic culture.

And finally, as he casts his line over the swirling water, the master fisherman, the Kingfisher, suddenly swoops down into a blinding flash, spears its tiny prey and flies off. Next, his heart skips a beat as a mugger crocodile breaks the surface to laze on the sandy beach.
And before he knows it, he gawks unbelievingly at a handsome Cheetal stag that approaches the other side of the river for a drink. Sheer bliss!
And all this time the ultimate quest for that elusive “Big One”—“the Mighty Mahseer” of his dream haunts his mind.  Save the Mahseer! Tight lines!

Smashed rods, mangled hooks, broken lines and shattered reels are not uncommon, particularly if the angler fails to handle the big mahseer that decides to dash for the nearest rapid. And you are just left wondering how the hell that happened! An angler once equated grappling the big ‘beast’ with a 10-round bout with no less a boxer than Mike Tyson!  
Let’s leaf through the pages of a history book and drift way back to the 1850s, when the British ruled India. The British Raj (1858–1947), they called it. Nobody during those early years of the Raj ever imagined that a fish called the mahseer (mahi- fish and sher- tiger or “tiger among fish” in Persian) would eventually rewrite history.
In 1873, an Englishman, Henry Sullivan Thomas, wrote the book called The Rod in India that dwelled on the natural history of fish, their culture and fishing for mahseer in India. The book became a Bible for the anglers across the globe. In 1948, the book titled Circumventing the Mahseer by Major A. St. J. Macdonald hit the shelves. And it became a ‘Classic.’
Major A. St. J. Macdonald with his brace of catches in 1930s: 55 and 75 pounders (Circumventing the Mahseer)
History re-written
The more I studied about this wonderful fish, the more my respect and affection grew and my passion for it snowballed into an obsession. I’d like to narrate one short anecdote from the book here, which, eventually, is said to have won this little-known fish the crowning glory across the globe.
During the British Raj in India, a young British officer was deputised to India in the Assam Province. This English gentleman, like many others from his native country, happened to be an avid angler.
After having comfortably settled and reported for duty, this guy started frequenting the officers’ club to chill out the evenings with his native countrymen. One evening, the fellow officers began to discuss fishing.
The newcomer launched himself into blowing his trumpet on his exploits on salmon fishing back home. He seemed a trifle too long-winded. One of the fellow officers cut in on him and asked, “Have you heard about the mahseer that is found in the Indian rivers”?
When his fellow officers filled him in on the native gamefish, the fellow retorted, “What’s mahseer? There’s no match whatsoever to the ‘lordly” salmon when it comes to freshwater fishing,” he snapped back and went on rambling on about the salmon. It’d be like chasing a wild goose to bring him around, the others realised.

A passionate angler as he was, he could not resist himself from trying his hand at fishing. One day, he decided, rather disdainfully, to go fishing to one of the rivers. After something like an hour, he finally got a bite, a big one at that.
A huge 40-pounder mahseer bit his baited hook—and all hell broke loose! The battle ensued. After sweating it out well over an hour, he finally landed the prize fish. Fittingly tamed and cut down to his size by the ferocious fighter, the Englishman from that day onwards never talked about the ‘lordly’ salmon.
The mahseer rewrote history. It became a legend. For the Englishmen, it became the most sought-after gamefish and a hot topic for writing. Books upon books, volumes upon volumes dedicated themselves to this charismatic species.
World fame
Apart from The Rod in India, other epics included The Angler in India or the Mighty Mahseer (1903) by Skene Dhu and The Compleat Indian Angler (2003) by John Masters, among a horde of others. Soon, the fame spread across the globe. Jim Corbett called it ‘the fish of my dreams’ and went on to christen it ‘the tiger of the water’.  Skene Dhu named it the ‘Mighty Mahseer’. In the later years, even films were shot on mahseer-angling.
“Of all the mammoth challenges still facing the world’s fishermen today, mahseer along the Himalayas is one of the greatest. Anyone who goes to the Himalayas and pulls off a fish or two has really recorded a triumph, a place in the history of fishing,” wrote John Bailey (writer, photographer and world-class angler), who also did a documentary film on the Golden Mahseer for the BBC’s Discovery Channel in 1990.
Recently, in 2017, fishinghimalayas.com, organised the filming of the “Fishing Impossible” the BBC Earth TV series. The quest was for the ‘gold’—the Golden Mahseer. The film was shot in the Phewa and Begnas lakes, Pokhara and also extended to the far west Nepal to Babai and the Karnali waters.

Indomitable fighter
Yes, it is unarguably the most ferocious freshwater gamefish in the world. Known to fight like cornered leopards, they exhibit brute power and lightning speed that no other river fish can match.
If hooked, a big mahseer sends shivers down every angler’s spine and even the most accomplished angler is humbled by its unbridled fury. Elusive and notoriously difficult to catch, it’s a daunting challenge that demands immense stamina to travel rugged terrain and face harsh weather conditions. Ultimately, your mind must be trained to revel not only in your success but with untold frustrating failures, too.

A true mahseer angler is the ‘breed’, who, time and again, must frequent that riverbank where he went through many failures and hardship. It’s like the stubborn mountaineer who fails to summit the Everest but doggedly keeps at it no matter what it takes . . . until he is rewarded.
Tackle & gear
The modern day tackle for fishing mahseer includes state-of-the-art reels, high-density carbon or graphite rods, top-of-the-shelf lines and myriad of lures that include the spinners, spoons, jerk-baits, you name it. Some, go for live-baits like minnows and apart from artificial flies, fly-fishers even try live river nymphs.
Smashed rods, mangled hooks, broken lines and shattered reels are not uncommon, particularly if the angler fails to handle the big mahseer that decides to dash for the nearest rapid. And you are just left wondering how the hell that happened! An angler once equated grappling the big ‘beast’ with a 10-round bout with no less a boxer than Mike Tyson!

The joy and thrill of hooking a big one is so immense that the mahseer angler never tires of relating his experience—the bite, the jerk and the initial rush the brute makes, which can be anything from 100 to 200 yards of your line, as you race along the rocky bank to keep pace with it and finally . . . land it.

Passion bordering on obsession
The book by A. St. J. Macdonald made me ‘take the bait.’ I devoted seven long years to do the study on this species, which took me to a host of rivers stretching from the east to the west of Nepal (read my previous stories).
One of my wanderings to the Koshi in East Nepal to Mai Beni, Baraha Chhetra in 2005 in pursuit of the Golden Mahseer (barbus tor putitora), Pahenle Sahar in Nepali, was the most memorable. I was hung-up on raising a little awareness among the anglers and the local fishing community about the endangered status of the golden mahseer and how to practice conservation methods.
The entire trip to Mai Beni with my fisher friends of Dharan was fraught with a mortal fear that we might, at any time, confront the Maoist activists as the length and breadth of the country was hard hit by Maoist insurgency. Luckily, we did not.
I had not the foggiest idea that my visit caused quite a stir in Mai Beni and Baraha Chhetra. After I was back home in Kathmandu, my Dharan friends called me to say that the Maoist cadres made inquiries about the city-slicker (yours truly), who had the nerve to mislead the riverside fishing community by asking them to release their catches, which meant virtually the same as forgoing their bread and butter. They’d completely misjudged my intentions.
Home for mahseer 
Nepal, under the shadows of the Himalayas, is a maze of rivers, snow-fed and spring-fed, flowing down south into the Ganges, India. Many of these rivers are home to the legendary mahseer including the most-coveted Himalayan Golden Mahseer—considered the ‘icing on the cake’ by anglers.
Local fisherman at Koshi Barrage
Our rivers like the Karnali, Bheri, Seti, Mahakali, Narayani and the Mighty Koshi with her seven tributaries hold this species in bountiful supply.
Fishing for mahseer has been an age-old custom among the fishing community of Nepal. If it means bread and butter for them, for other local aficionados, it serves as a great recreational sport. As the access to modern-day tackle for most is still off-limit, they still resort today to the primitive crude methods.
Local fisher at Mai Beni, east Nepal
My angling tours to the Sapta Koshi, Arun, Tammar, Sun Koshi and Tama Koshi rivers in the east and the Karnali, Trishuli and Babai in the west revealed many big mahseer catches from 10 to 35 kilos made by the local riverside community. Most of such catches were made on thapuwa balchhi―hooks baited with live fish cast at night and retrieved in the morning. Such catches also included Goonch catfish, which can grow to monster sizes and are found in our rivers, both the east and the west.
The primitive method of fishing days are long past for the present-day fishers. It has been replaced by modern fishing tackle and hardware with futuristic reels and latter-day rods, hooks, lures and line.

Migratory run
Mahseer is a migratory cold water fish that inhabits rivers and lakes that have inlets and outlets to a river. It spawns during monsoon floods (June-September). Much the same as the salmon travels hundreds of miles upstream to spawn, the mahseer ascents up-river to considerable heights (from as low as 300 ft. to 2,500ft from sea level), to placid spring-fed feeder streams, to spawn and deposit their eggs.
After the monsoon they return to the foothills, then migrate back again to the upper reaches to breed where there are many snow and glacier-fed rivers—the mahseers’ natural habitat. It is called the migratory run.
During my fishing trip to Mai Beni, my veteran fisher friends had their own way of drawing their views about the migration run.  “When the Brahimini ducks or the Ruddy Shelducks were sighted taking to their wings from the riverbanks and the Koshi revealed schools of  minnows darting upriver literally between our knees in the clear water, we knew the mahseers were on their migratory run,” said Bharat Sunuwar, one of my fisher friends from Dharan.
That was not something my fisher friends learned from a book but from nuances of long experience at the river. I called it the ‘river lore’.

The monsoon is upon us. No word sounded lovelier when in mid-June the vast sky opened up and slaked the parched ashy-grey cityscape generously with the rains after the long spell of fierce heat the metropolis dished out during the last week of May.
It came belatedly, only on the 20th of June as against the normal onset time, the 10th of June. First arrived the gentle showers in fine droplets, but as the days went by—as unpredictable as they could get—turned into downpours followed by battering cloudbursts.

You can never tell when they appear or stop as quickly as they started, and without so much as a whisper pick up where they left off. Come monsoon, the heavens open up as they say it.
I saw it for the last 66 years, will continue to do so; so did my forbears in the same spirit; so will you, and your posterity . . . and theirs. Folks, like it or lump it, you have to learn to live with it simply because it’s the monsoon.
Green at its best
Yes, look around and you’ll find it green all around you—the countryside, the suburbs, the lush paddy fields and the forested hills that stand out clear as the rains wash the murky smog off. And this is the time of the year when the rains help to scour our rivers clean of the appalling pile-up of filth. I, for one, sit on my patio and watch my tiny garden grow greener, as it were, challenging the emeralds. My eyes stray from one plant to another seemingly jostling with each other to grow faster and greener, the creepers reaching for the sky, and the flowers vying for my attention.
Curiously, even the grass on my lawn seems to race against the clock in its bid to turn greener and lusher! And my little cairn sits in the corner looking awesome (took a lot of effort for me to stack them). I sit quietly and try to soak everything in. Lo and behold, even my turtle seems to enjoy it! Suddenly, I hear the crack of thunder and soon the rains arrive. I proudly look at my garden and ask myself: “Isn’t it green at its best?”

Gosh! That unmistakable scent as the raindrops meet the soil on the flower beds, the lawn, and the flowerpots! I just love it. Earthy, fresh—but what else—musky, pungent . . . ? My olfactory dictionary lacks the word to describe it.
When the raindrops hit the dust or clay soil, they trap tiny air bubbles on the surface, which subsequently shoot upward–redolent of a glass of champagne—bursts, and then like an aerosol sprays out that bizarre fragrance. Science says: it is petrichor.
Jogging memories
Yes! As I sit back on my patio watching the rains, old memories come flooding by—some are sweet, some not-so-sweet, others bitter closely followed by past incidents that make for amusing anecdotes to look back on . . . and live them. I call them my monsoon escapades. One particular occurrence that took place some eight years ago in the lake-city Pokhara still feels like only yesterday. For that, we will have to travel back in time. Shall we?
Angling in Fewa

I’m nuts about fishing. Whether ponds, rivers, reservoirs or lakes, they draw me like the bees to the honeypot. Big lake, bigger bags, I thought excitedly when I arrived in Pokhara.
I hired a boat at the Fewa lakeside and set out with a local guy feeling high as a kite when I learned that he was an old hand at the game. My fishing guide suggested that we picked one of the isolated spots on the opposite bank to give a wide berth to scores of boaters that crowded the lake. Perfect, I said to myself.
 

 
The morning looked promising—a clear sky sans the monsoon clouds as we headed across the emerald-green water of Lake Fewa armed to the teeth with our fishing tackles. The lake holds gamefish such as rohu (Asian wild carp), common carp, catla (Asian carp), tilapia and bighead, among others.
 

The thought that I might run into a Golden Mahseer (highly prized by avid anglers) or two fired my imagination. Our small two-man boat made it to the opposite bank before we knew it. It seemed my fisher friend was good at paddling too.
We lost no time. Honestly, I could not wait to cast my line. I beamed happily to find no soul around the spot at the early hour. The water calm and beckoning. The forested foothill rose high up behind our backs. Save for the sound of the ebb and flow of the water that slapped against the sandy bank and receded like clockwork, the total hush felt almost spooky.
The cool crisp morning felt invigorating. The musty, earthy smell of the lake waters felt gratifying while the wooded hills reminded me of being in the lap of nature. “This is total bliss,” I thought aloud.
For bait, we had a mix of chicken feed and refined flour kneaded into a fine dough. Man, did it smell awful! My partner told me that he’d added a dash of tongba (a light local-beer made from fermented millet) sediment. This fish-bait concoction was Pokhara’s local favorite.
Apart from it, my partner fished out something from a plastic bag. It was cow (buffalo?) dung! To my great disgust, he made them into balls with his bare hand and wrapped up the baited hook with it. Ugh! When I asked why the dung, he said that the smell lured the fish. I’d done a lot of fishing but that came as a total surprise. Later, I learned that to be a common practice among fishers in Pokhara.
The fishing began. With bated breath, I hurled my first line weighed down by the wonder dough, then another. So did my partner—four rods in total. All we had to do then was lie back and wait with an eye on the tip of the rod for a tug from the fish . . . and, of course, our fingers crossed. Fishing means waiting it out, which could be hours without flinching a muscle. I regretted not having brought a book to kill time.
Total blank
The waiting seemed truly excruciating as the morning drew closer to noon. In between the time, we changed our baits and switched the cast-spots. Except for feeble bites, not worth a jerk at the line, we kept in wait, pinning our hopes on a big catch. Time for lunch, my partner announced. He’d brought big fat tuna sandwiches that made my mouth water.
After three in the afternoon, I began to despair. No bites, whatsoever! On the other hand, my partner fumed and cursed. “Preposterous,” he blurted out, his frustration written all over his face. “This has never happened before,” he lamented loudly.
Later, my partner seemed to fuss about as he changed our hooks, added a little more of the smelly tongba to the dough and asked me to move farther along to our right. Practically, he did everything going by the book. I stayed quiet trying not to let my disappointment show.
For me, the improved bait, the rejigging of the hooks and the change of spot brought high hopes. I cast my line with renewed energy, the suspense killing me. Suddenly, at around four in the afternoon, the weather seemed to take a mood-swing as low-hanging dark clouds drifted in over the lake. The bag remained at naught.
Disaster struck
And to confirm my fears, the sky rumbled and a bolt of lightning snaked through the air. Time, we called it a day, I thought. Fishing during thunder lightning is dangerous as the fishing rods, normally made of graphite or carbon-fiber, act as good conductors and may add to the risk of a lightning strike.
That was about it all. Resignedly, we hurriedly packed our gear and prepared to leave lest the rains beat us to it. I felt the first droplets on my cheeks even before we started. Before long, they turned into larger drops sounding the warning bells. Then, all hell broke loose before we could gather our wits!
Hardly had we paddled 50 yards than it began pouring, soon replaced by a cloudburst that tore down at us in torrents. We could hardly see five feet beyond the bow through the sheets of rain. That scared the pants off of me. It did not end at that. Damn!
Our luck seemed to run out on us. Suddenly, the high drama took another twist and we were out of the frying pan into the fire. The small boat started filling up with the rainwater. Soon, it rose to a dangerous level of the hull. As my partner furiously worked the paddles, I frantically bailed the water out with the small bucket that previously carried the fish bait.
Close shave
I started shivering. The rains brought in a chillness to the air. I think it was both fear and the chill that did it when it suddenly struck me that I did not know how to swim. As my companion dug in deep with the paddles, I feverishly kept at hurling the water out, the rain almost blinding my vision. Did I pray too? I do not remember . . . I must have. Suddenly, a question flashed across my mind. Are we going to capsize and sink?
After what appeared like a half-hour, the dreadful ordeal ended. The rain fell back to a light shower. I still shook uncontrollably as we made it to the opposite bank. I eventually sighed in relief. Suddenly it dawned on me that I’d be celebrating my forthcoming birthday. Phew!
As I finished writing, the sky again opened up for the rains. Folks, its monsoon time!

Vines, wild ferns, creepers, lush foliage, dense undergrowth, and an occasional fallen tree greeted us as we climbed up the steps. The damp places showed rocks encrusted with lush green moss. The mingled smell of the damp earth, the pines, the rotting fallen leaves, decaying wood, the dead foliage intensified by the ‘petrichor’ brought in by the recent rains made my head swim.
I spotted a shallow pit by the side of the trail, obviously dug up by a wild boar to forage for roots and tubers. Suddenly, the forest came alive with an ear-splitting sound. The cicadas! The loudest among all the insects of the world, they are ‘one of nature’s great sound–atmospheric and enigmatic.’

While doing frequent cycling jaunts on the Mudkhu-Teen Piplé-Sanglé route north-west of the Kathmandu valley rim, I’d instinctively look up to my north at the towering forested hills above Jitpur Phedi, my eyes glued to the breach on the sheer craggy height. It literally beckoned.
That crack on the naked rock-face, the local folks say, is the Tarkeshwor Mahadev shrine. For years, I longed to go there, but never got around to it. Someday . . . I’d keep telling myself. And the day did come on the last week of June 2019.
For mountain bikers, the two-and-a-half-hour round trip on the Mudkhu-Teen Piplé-Sanglé circuit, first on a paved road and later a dirt road past quaint little village-towns like Jitpur Phedi, Kabhresthali, and Sanglé promises a decent cross-country spin.

The track offers both modest up-hills and rock-strewn down-hills to thrill the mountain biking buffs including the “bikeoholics” (mountain biking limbo meaning hardcore riders) to while away their weekend mornings.  Small wonder, it has become a popular haunt for all the bikers.
Hiking not biking                                                                                   
This time, the trip happened to be a hike and not a ride on my bicycle. There were five of us –Shayeet, my cycling partner, his mother, Shalu, my wife, Radhika, I and a teenager guest from Bangladesh, Adriana. A first cousin to Shayeet, she was in Kathmandu for her holiday.  We made quite a mixed bunch, old, not-very-old and kids in their teens!
From left to right: Shayeet, Adriana, Shayeet’s mom and Radhika (front)
None of us had been to the place before, so no one knew the route.  A quick look on the Internet helped me. We decided on a ride to Teen Piplé and then hike from there (buses ply on the road as it happens to be the Trishuli Highway with beautiful hill-towns like Kakani and Rani Pauwa en route). We did not catch a bus but drove instead, a 45-minute ride, in my car.
Wavering start
As the Internet did not have enough info on the place, things like distance, villages on the track, teahouses and the like, we thought it best to pack our lunch. Later, we found that we had figured it right.
As we planned to leave after breakfast, we prepared the food the previous night. With rain-jackets, umbrellas, water bottles, and, whatnots taken care of, we were all set to backpack it to Tarkeshwor the next day.
Come the next day, and I awoke to a sudden thrumming, which soon turned into a familiar pelting sound. Oh, no–the rain! I cursed. I always love the sound of the rain drumming on the windows and the floor outside my patio.  But never did I hate the rains so much than that particular morning. At first, it was just a light pitter-patter, but soon it started pouring.
“There goes our trip down the drain,” I hollered. Hoping for the impossible to happen, Radhika and I helped ourselves with breakfast.  More likely than not, the rest of the group, our close neighbors, was going through the same plight.
The rain, lo and behold, suddenly showed the signs of letting up. Miraculously, it stopped. A little later the sun started peeking in through the clouds.  Radhika’s phone rang, and the group made a hurried appearance. Time to move; everyone piled into the car and I took the wheel.
The winding drive past Mudkhu Bhanjhyang with the towering Nagarjun hill blanketed with the dense forest was a sight for sore eyes after the unsightly urban sprawl and the traffic snarl at the busy Ring Road. The paved road until Osho Tapoban, the Rajneesh Meditation Centre, was fairly good.
Because of muddy stretches, the onward driving got tricky and slowed down almost to a crawl.  It bothered me that we might get caught out on the thick muck as the road was riddled with frequent muddy puddles, and deep ruts, which never seemed to end. Phew! To my great relief, we finally made it to Teen Piplé, the kick-off point for our hike.
The Hike

After parking our car at Teen Piplé, we picked up a few tips about the trail from the locals and hit the country pathway.  As I could foretell, some said it would take an hour; others put it at a little over two hours. That’s how it is in the villages. Ten minutes can be a half-hour and an hour nothing less than two hours.
The ladies were spared the lugging as Shayeet and I volunteered to carry the backpacks with our food and other stuffs. “Whoa!” That came off Radhika. The long flight of steps right from the start looked intimidating.  As it turned out, the trail seemed to be interspersed with dirt paths that made it easier for Radhika (she has a knee problem).
Panch Mané

The trail continued uphill with scattered houses and cultivated lands amidst the country landscape. The hillside appeared green with sparse woodland, extensive spread of lush maize-crops and vegetables growing in small patches adjoining the houses. As we huffed it uphill, a little before the town of Panch Mané, our eyes met an impressive sight.

At first sight, we took it for a gompa(monastery) as the hills of the Kathmandu Valley rim are dotted with them. On cresting the ridge, it, however, turned out to be a Hindu shrine, the Bhuwaneswori Temple. Goddess Bhuwaneswori is none other than goddesses Bhagwati or Durga and revered as a manifestation of the formidable Kali Mata, too.

The multi-tiered pagoda-shaped temple with overhanging eaves and the roofs finished in golden colour stood high from the ground lending a dignified look. A long flight of steps led to the entrance.  A young pujari (priest) led us in for the darshan (homage). As expected, no photography was allowed.
After the darshan, to our great surprise, the pujari offered a plate of Prasad (devotional offer of food) to each of us, which included fresh-fried puri, haluwa (kind of sweet made out of semolina) and potato curry. That mightily impressed us all. Starved as I was, I was tempted to go for a second helping, but checked myself.
“The temple was built some seven years back by Shyam Baba but the building was razed to the ground in the 2015 earthquake. The baba, who is also a great scholar, took the pains to rebuild it after the earthquake,” informed the young priest. A number of small pagoda-style houses in the foreground of the main temple, he said, were Baba’s living quarters.

“Devotees throng the temple twice every year to observe Navratri, once in summer (Ram Nawami/Chait-dashain) and again at the onset of winter during Vijaya Dashami or dashain,” the young priest added.

The trail then climbed again and met with a dirt road that led to the Panch Mané village. The cluster of houses lining the road also included a homestay.  As we continued along the road, our eyes caught sight of a number of round brick structures, three to be exact, which appeared like water storage tanks. They were not.

“They are historic Manés (homogeneous to Buddhist stupas), which date back to the times of Prithvi Narayan Shah. This village is in fact named after those manés, “said Bijay Aryal, a local guy I happened to run into.
“During those days, there were four entry points into the Kathmandu Valley and Panch Mané happened to be one of them. Going by history, while stationed at Panch Mané, King Prithvi  Narayan Shah contemplated the invasion of the then Valley of Nepal(Kathmandu, Bhadgaon, and Lalitpur),” he further added.
“Before the devastating earthquake of 2015, there were five of them, thus, the name Panch(five) Mané. Two of them were swept away in a landslip following the earthquake,” Bijay further explained.
After a cup of tea at a local teashop and a brief respite, we resumed our hike. The dirt road ended at a wooded foothill and turned into a narrow foot trail. With no habitation and not a soul around the trail climbed through tall pine trees and brush.
Shortly, the stone steps appeared, and Radhika broke into one of her vociferous protests (she did that during our last hike to Bishnudwar in the Shivapuri heights, too). Howsoever grumbling she did on such hikes, she loves it in all reality. She is plucky, all right!
The rest of us were doing good. Only Adriana seemed breathless and looked tired. She told me that she had never done a tough hike like that before and never been to that high an elevation. She came from Dhaka, an elevation of just four meters from the sea-level and with no hill whatsoever in sight.

And there she was slogging it up a steep hill doing above 1,700m from the sea-level! Great work, I said to the brave girl from Dhaka. She smiled back and said that she was really enjoying it, and that she will have quite a story to tell her friends back home.

The forest
The trail got steeper and wound up through the thick forest. We came across a board that declared we were within the Shivapuri National Park. As we gained elevation, the tall pines were replaced by the deciduous broad-leaved forest, both temperate and sub-tropical. Surprisingly, the trail remained hushed with no one in sight. The only sound we could hear was the faint call of the birds and the wild crickets.
Vines, wild ferns, creepers, lush foliage, dense undergrowth, and an occasional fallen tree greeted us as we climbed up the steps. The damp places showed rocks encrusted with lush green moss. The mingled smell of the damp earth, the pines, the rotting fallen leaves, decaying wood, the dead foliage intensified by the ‘petrichor’ brought in by the recent rains made my head swim.

I spotted a shallow pit by the side of the trail, obviously dug up by a wild boar to forage for roots and tubers. Suddenly, the forest came alive with an ear-splitting sound. The cicadas! The loudest among all the insects of the world, they are ‘one of nature’s great sound–atmospheric and enigmatic.’
The Shrine

After something like an hour on the trail uphill, we spotted a metal step ladder leaned against a sheer rock face with overhanging undergrowth.  We had finally made it to the Tarkeshwor Mahadev. The height commanded a birds-eye-view of the valley–once pristine and verdant some three decades ago now looking pathetic enveloped in filthy haze and smog.

The main shrine in two storeys seemed carved into a solid huge boulder looking like an alcove with a sheer drop to its south. A stone Shivalinga with four faces (mukhalinga) sat in the far corner and a stone Nandi (sacred bull calf), a vehicle and gatekeeper of Lord Shiva, stood sentinel in the foreground. A small pit next to the entrance held a little stagnant water. In fact, it was not.

“The water in that pit is from the sacred lake in the Himalayas, the Gosaikunda (4,380m). The water drains into it perennially,” said Baba Shrinath, the only mortal we met on the hike. A flight of metal steps went up to a narrow rocky overhang in the upper storey, which housed metal bells and a trident.

“The Tarkeshwor Mahadev is said to have surfaced at the present site in the Satyayug (Golden Age; the first-ever epoch on earth) when one of the lifeless limbs of Lord Shiva’s first consort, Goddess Sati Devi’s right limb fell off at the spot,” the Baba shed light on it by recounting one of the mythological accounts from the Swasthani Brata Katha .
“The Gosaikunda water began draining into the pit as a result of deep-seated tapasya (spiritual deep meditation, an exercise in austerity, and self-discipline) performed by yogis (saints) from the Satyayug,” the baba further added. He has been residing at the Tarkeshwor site for the last 25 years.

I was so famished that I could eat a horse, so were the others. We wolfed down our packed lunch of home-cooked chicken biryani and matar paneer, rested a bit and then backtracked down the hill. At Panch Mané, we came across an open truck parked beside a teashop. We asked the driver if we could hitch a ride up to Teen Piplé. It was a big yes.
Radhika seemed the happiest as the way back still meant coping with a long flight of knee-buckling steps down to Teen Piplé (going down-steps hurts the knees more for those with the problem).  Frankly, I was too, for I was spared her screaming bloody murder at me.

Kathmandu, December 10
After the merger between Global IME Bank and Janata Bank into the biggest commercial bank of the country, some other institutions have also shown interest to follow suit.
Of late, Prabhu Bank has initiated talks with NCC Bank in its attempt to finalise a merger. “Some of our friends have started informal talks with NCC operators,” a member of the bank’s board of directors says, “We are not sure if it can be made though. The other party has not responded to us yet.”
However, both the banks have already endorsed a decision to go into the merger via their general assemblies.
Likewise, Nepal Bangladesh Bank is also looking for an appropriate bank to merge with. The bank is holding its next general convention on December 23, during which the current board of directors will table a proposal for the merger.
A few months ago, Everest Bank and Laxmi Bank had made an agreement for the merger, which could not materialise due to different reasons. Now, the two banks are up again. A member of the board of directors of Everest Bank says his team is holding a discussion with a bank, refusing to reveal the bank’s name.
Civil Bank chairman Ichchha Raj Tamang is also busy meeting officials of other banks in his merger bid.",/business,"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 04:44:35 +0000"

Kathmandu, December 11
Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe is likely to tender her resignation to pave the way for a fellow party comrade to take charge of the lower house of Parliament, NCP sources say adding that her successor will come from a party other than the NCP and the Nepali Congress.
This comes as leaders of the ruling NCP intensify discussions ahead of the December 20 commencement of the winter session of Parliament. According to party sources, Prime Minister Oli and NCP Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal are to meet to pick the new Speaker of the House, two months after Speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara stepped down amid allegations of sexual misconduct.
Although Tumbahamphe has agreed in principle to step down, it is not yet clear whether she will step down before the December 20 meeting or after announcing elections for Speaker. An NCP source said that the leadership wants Tumbahamphe to resign ahead of the meeting so that the senior-most MP can chair the meeting.

Nembang, Sapkota in the fray 



According to party sources, former Speaker Subas Nembang and former Minister Agni Sapkota are the front runners for the post. NCP Chief Whip Dev Gurung and Tumbahamphe are also in contention. The NCP leadership, however, wants a member of the party Standing Committee to take charge of Parliament. PM Oli is in favour of  Nembang as he has vast experience running Parliament. The Oli camp anticipates that the Dahal camp will propose Sapkota for the job.
Meanwhile, the NCP is likely to offer the post of Deputy Speaker to the fringe parties as the constitution states that the Deputy Speaker and the Speaker should not only be aligned to different parties, but also belong to different genders. As the Deputy Speaker is also a member of the Constitutional Council, which makes appointments to key constitutional bodies, the NCP does not want to hand over the post to the Nepali Congress.
Rastriya Janamorcha’s Durga Paudel is being seen as the front runner for the position as the party has a good track-record of electoral alliances with the NCP.  Baburam Bhattarai’s Socialist Party is also likely to stake a claim for the post, but the party’s ties with the NCP have soured in the past few weeks is not going to help the cause.",/political,"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 07:12:54 +0000"

As of now, Karnali is the least illuminated province with the national electricity grid. Only 30 per cent households in the province have access to electricity, the authority says.
Since the province has difficult terrain, electrification in Karnali needs more money, but the government is receiving a loan of Rs 22 billion from Asian Infrastructure Development Bank and European Investment Bank at a subsidised rate.

A recent revision made to the European Commission Air Safety List has kept Nepal among 15 states whose all airlines have been banned from operating in the region. Nepali airline companies have been banned in Europe since 2013. The commission has been claiming that the ban has been imposed “due to a lack of safety oversight by the aviation authorities.”
Meanwhile, the revised list has removed airline companies from Gabon “following improvements to the aviation safety situation in that country”.
After the revision, a total of 115 airline companies are banned from the European skies including all companies of 15 countries such as Nepal and six individual companies of different counties.

Similarly, the ruling party is pressing Tumbahamphe to resign from the position so that the party can file candidacy for the speaker.

Saying that the protests were raised ‘just for the formality’s sake’, they claim the party leadership including Prime Minister and chairman KP Sharma Oli and executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal is ready to endorse the pact from Parliament. The agreement’s implementation has not started yet as the legislative has not approved the deal.
Prime Minister Oli is for an early endorsement and implementation of the agreement. He had publicly criticised the then speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara for failing to approve the deal from the House during the last session.
Further, the International Affairs Department of the party has also suggested that the party endorse the deal after a minute study, hence the party is not in a position to go back.
However, standing committee members such as Bhim Rawal and Dev Gurung have been protesting the deal, suspecting that the US government offered the grant so as to convince Nepal to join its controversial Indo-Pacific Strategy.
“But we believe the MCC agreement is a different component because it was signed before the Indo-Pacific Strategy came into discussion,” the party’s International Affairs Department’s deputy chief Bishnu Rijal says, “The prime minister wants to endorse it as soon as possible, and he is right.”
During the ongoing standing committee meeting of the party, Rawal and Gurung spoke against the deal. It is expected that Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokharel and Foreign Affairs Minister Pradeep Gyawali will speak later in the meeting highlighting the need of the deal. Since Oli is not attending the meeting, Pokharel and Gyawali will also represent the government’s opinion about the issue.

Kathmandu, December 20
Apparently owing to the pressure put by construction entrepreneurs, the government is preparing to amend the Public Procurement Regulation once again. Of late, the contractors have been blaming the policies and laws including the regulation for the government’s failure to effectively spend development budget and complete infrastructure projects on time.
An official at the Prime Minister’s Office says concerned agencies such as the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport are studying obstacles caused by the regulation as a part of the homework to amend the regulation.
“Since the entrepreneurs have claimed that the government could not spend development budget as it was not allowed to spend on older projects, we are studying these issues,” he says, adding extending the deadline of old projects would be a highlight of the amendment.
In the first year of his premiership, KP Sharma Oli had warned that all contracts would be scrapped if the contractors failed to meet the target on time. However, the new amendment will have an exactly opposite effect, it has been learned.
Further, the government is currently in a defensive position as it has not been able to spend the development budget effectively even in presence of such a stable government. As five months have passed in the current fiscal year, the government has spent only nine per cent of the development budget.
In the past year, the government has already amended the regulation three times. The last two of them were introduced owing to the contractors’ concerns.",/business,"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 04:23:56 +0000"

This comes a month after the Supreme Court released the full text of its decision on the Ncell tax issue, in response to a writ filed by the telecom company earlier in April this year. The order stated that the company needs to pay only Rs 21.10 billion in capital gains tax against the Rs39.06 billion previously determined by the tax officials.
The Large Taxpayers’ Office on April 16 said that the combined tax liability of Ncell and its parent company, Axiata, was Rs62.63 billion, including interest and fees based on the Income Tax Act. As Ncell had already paid Rs 23.57 billion in capital gains tax, the office ordered it to deposit the remaining Rs39.06 billion within a week. But the company went to court on April 22challenging the order. The company claimed that its capital gains tax liability from the three-year-old Ncell buyout deal stood at Rs 14.36 billion, and not Rs 39.06 billion, as it had already deposited R s23.57 billion. Following the petition, the Supreme Court in August annulled the tax liability determined by Large Taxpayers’ Office, stating that additional fees, imposed as per the Income Tax Act, should not be added to Ncell’s total tax liability.
Following the Supreme Court’s release of the full text of the judgement, the LTO had asked Ncell to submit Rs 21.10 billion within 15 days. According to sources, Ncell paid only Rs 4.5 billion as ‘first installment’. Authorities are yet to decide whether to accept the installment or not.",/business,"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 09:41:06 +0000"

New business models, push for rural electrification spring up in Nepal and Pakistan, but India still in dilemma 
When Anjal Niraula and his colleagues came up with the idea of ‘Gham Power’, they wanted to solve a pressing problem plaguing Nepal, especially Kathmandu. Nepal’s state-owned power monopoly Nepal Electricity Authority enforced up to 18 hours of daily power-cuts (locally known as ‘load-shedding’) as it could not meet the growing demand for power. The power cuts crippled daily life in Nepal. While businesses resorted to running fuel-guzzling generators, the general public had no option but to adjust their lifestyle to the power-cut schedule. 
“The problem we faced was that we could not run our computers,” says 30-year-old Niraula, who is now the CEO of Gham Power. “So we came up with the idea of selling solar power units to individuals and companies who wanted some form of power during the power-cuts.”
For a few years, the model worked well with the company attracting a steady number of customers. But all that changed in 2016 when Kul Man Ghising, a technocrat, was appointed Nepal Electricity Authority’s Managing Director. Ghising, now one of the most popular faces in Nepali media, came up with a plan to manage power in the country with an aim to end power-cuts. To the surprise of his critics, Ghising delivered on his promise by rolling out key policy changes: importing power from India, taking stringent measures against power pilferage and speeding up the construction of hydro-power projects.
After the power cuts became history, Gham Power was faced with the challenge of adapting to the changing nature of the power business in Nepal. “Critics wrote off companies like Gham Power because they thought our whole business proposition was over,” says Niraula. “But we were just getting started,” he adds.
It was not just Gham Power that was getting started. Hundreds of kilometres north, in neighbouring China, the solar panel industry was about to undergo a tidal shift with companies such as Yingli Jinko, Longi, Trina Solar and JA Solar at the forefront of international market expansion. This would not only change the business model of Nepali companies such as Gham Power, but also send shockwaves across South Asia.
Eight years after the pioneering entrepreneur Shi Zhengrong set up the first commercial Chinese production line in 2002, Chinese solar companies were having their dream run in the domestic market, thanks to government subsidies aimed at stimulating production and meeting the National Energy Administration’s yearly targets for installing solar capacity. The subsidies coupled with guaranteed electricity prices meant that Chinese companies led the world in new solar installations in each of the past five years.
It had all begun In 2001 when Shi, a solar-cell research PhD living in Australia, returned to China with a $6 million in backing from Wuxi government, and some assistance from ex-colleagues at his Australian university. Sales boomed as the market for solar rapidly expanded following Germany’s plan to install one million rooftop solar panels, which would eventually be sourced from China. Along with growing demand, global investors generously backed Chinese solar companies. Before the global financial crisis began in 2008, nine Chinese photovoltaic companies including Trina and Yingli were listed on US exchanges.

Chinese solar manufacturers often reinvest 6 per cent of their total annual revenues in research and development and invest aggressively in new capacity additions – making old capacity redundant within only several years. This becomes a strategic advantage – foreign competitors can’t keep up with the cash reinvestment, and customers accept that the Chinese tier one supplier offer the best and latest technology available anywhere, says Tim Buckley, Director of Energy Finance Studies, Australia/South Asia for the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
“China has massive scale as a key advantage, producing 60-70GW of modules annually, mostly across their top 10 firms, all of whom are in the world’s top 12 manufacturers,” he adds. 
“China also works on a much longer time horizon than other countries. The near term profit focus is almost non-existent, the key priorities are investment, employment, exports and technology leadership globally. That in part explains the Chinese propensity to overbuild new investment capacity ahead of demand. Absent strong organic demand growth globally, the result is oversupply and hence significant price declines (often 10- 20 per cent annually) which in turn stimulates demand, but also erodes profit margins and kills off international competition.”
As the profit margin eroded, the subsidies’ bill grew unsustainably, and soon authorities realised that the risk of overcapacity was growing. On May 31, 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Energy Administration introduced the ‘531 Policy’ (unveiled on the 31st day of the fifth month, hence ‘531’) under which authorities announced phasing-out of subsidies.
The policy announcement led to a sudden contraction of demand for PVs in the local market. “It is because the solar industry [in China] is still policy-led,” said Wang Bohua, president of the China Solar Association. According to the association, in the third quarter this year, the newly installed PV capacity was only 17.5GW, a decrease of 51.4 per cent compared to that of last year. Operators of solar power stations are under the greatest pressure. 
Since mid-2018, the stock prices and PV product prices of most solar companies in China have fallen sharply. At the same time, as the arrears in subsidies for renewable resource funds, the financial institutions are more cautious about the loans related to solar stations. Even the leading companies have also experienced difficulties in financing. In addition to this, a large number of solar power plants are being developed through financial leasing.  In addition to this, large solar power companies are selling off their assets in big numbers. According to “2019 China PV Power Station Assets Trading White Paper”, after the “531 ” in 2018, China’s PV power station asset transaction scale reached 1,295MW and the transaction amount reached 8.927 billion yuan, which was nearly ten times that of a year ago.

Although the domestic market is full of sorrows, the overseas market skyrocketed to a new record since then. Data from China Customs shows that in the third quarter this year, the total export of photovoltaics (silicon wafers, cells, modules) was the US $ 17.74 billion, an increase of 3.2 per cent year-on-year, and has exceeded the total export value of 2018. The Photovoltaic Association predicts that the PV export amount in 2019 will reach 65GW, even exceeding the level before 2017, (when the US imposed Section 201 tariffs on Chinese solar products). 
At Yingli’s sales office in Hebei, staffers look at sales figures from different markets. While they are upbeat about the international market, particularly India, the news is not so good when it comes to the domestic market. “The demand in India is huge. Even with China ’s production capacity, and the addition of our units in Vietnam and Thailand, there’s just not enough panels to sell,” said Zhao Bing, Director of Yingli Overseas Sales. “Due to the huge demand, the current foundries in the two regions cannot meet the needs of the entire India market,” Zhao added. 
Yingli, once the largest solar PV manufacturer in the world, sees emerging markets in South Asia as a beacon of hope as it faces financial doldrums, which led to its delisting from the NYSE in June 2018, just a few days after the ‘531 policy’ announcement. While venturing in South Asia, Yingli has opted a light-asset business model. Rather than investing in solar stations, it set up sales branches in India. In order to adapt to the local business environment, it even hired local employees to communicate directly with customers.
It’s not just Yingli, solar companies such as Jinko, Longi, Trina Solar and JA Solar have all expand their overseas market shares to over 60 per cent, some are even more than 90%. Before the ‘531 policy’ that figure was around 30%-40%. In the ten-year history of Chinese solar’s overseas expansion, this is the third time that Chinese companies have made an aggressive push into the international market taking advantage of their industrial clusters and supply chains which helps them produce solar panels at a cost lower than anywhere else in the world.
During the first wave, which began in the first half of the 2000s, Chinese solar panel sales boomed in the United States, the European Union, Australia and Canada. But the wave ended in 2017 with the US and EU introducing tariffs on Chinese solar panels to protect their own solar manufacturers. But the second wave had already begun. Chinese manufacturers set their eye on Japan, India, and Turkey. Between 2015-16 alone, Indian market accounted for more than 30 per cent of the entire export market. The third wave of Chinese solar is going to Europe, Africa, Middle-east and South Asia.
“We are past the price point where solar power can compete with other power sources,” says Anjal Niraula, CEO of Gham Power.
For many solar companies, South Asia is a fertile land. Different from the previous waves, the background of this round of “going global” is that since 2017, but in South Asia, there seem to be tempting cakes. While governments around South Asia are making pledges to incorporate solar power into their power mix, private companies have come up with new business models to make use of solar power.
At his office in Kathmandu, Anjal Niraula, the CEO of Gham Power is also working on a much longer time horizon than his competitors. “There was a time when solar power cost around 50-60 cent per watt. But after the Chinese policy change, it dropped to 20-30 cents per watt. Before the price drop, solar was considered as an alternative source of power in Nepal because of its price.” 
“But now we are past the price point where solar power can compete with other power sources. Thanks to the drop in prices, Gham Power can now offer power to its customers at a rate cheaper than that of the government grid,” Niraula shares emphatically. “If we look at the cost involved, it has hit the right price point for us to develop ourselves as an energy service company.”
Until now, Gham Power, which started off as a company to provide ‘back-up’ power, has developed three projects under a new model made possible by the drop in PV prices. “ We talk to potential clients, look at their roof space, their electricity bill, load profile and calculate the potential power that can be generated using solar PVs. When the client signs up with us, they don’t need to pay anything for the solar plant; they pay a certain fee per unit of electricity they receive from our solar plant and after 15 years they get to own the entire system.”

Around 1,900 km from Kathmandu, Sabhagi Dablo rushes to a visitor at the courtyard of her mud-brick home. There, she proudly points towards a large blue and white panel that sticks out rather awkwardly from its surrounding. “I sold my goat and bought a solar panel,” the mother of six explains enthusiastically, “Now, I can light bulbs in my house at least. There are no electricity problems anymore.”
Dablo lives in a small fishing hamlet in Thatta, around 110 kilometres from Karachi, Pakistan’s port city. She, and the other women like her, had lived in darkness for too long. The electric infrastructure of the village was old and unrepaired. Most of the village only received power in the mornings and that too for a few hours. Nights were pitch black and cold.
Fed up, she sold one of her goats for Rs 16,000 and used the money to invest in a small solar power station. Its panels convert radiation from sunlight into electricity, powering her home. Now, Dablo, and other women from her village, gather in her courtyard every other night to embroidery bed linens, quilts and clothes, which can be sold in the local market. In fact in this tiny village in Sindh, women are leading the way towards rural electrification, through clean and renewable sources of energy. In recent years, the delta of the Indus River, once the fifth largest in the world, has suffered immensely due to the building of dams and barrages upstream. This has had a devastating effect on the lifeline of poor farming and fishing communities located along the river’s stretch.
“Our agriculture lands have become infertile and there is no fish in the river,” she explains, “due to which several fishermen have migrated to other areas. But people like us, who are too poor to move, have no choice but to live through hard times.” Her village not only lacks electricity, but it also does not have basic infrastructures, such as roads, potable water and healthcare.
Life in these remote communities is difficult, which is why says Sultan Ahmed, a social worker in the Thatta district, the small solar panels are a “god-sent miracle”. They are changing living conditions in impoverished villages that have limited access to the country’s electric power system.

“Many villages in Sindh are now switching to solar power, as it is affordable,” said Ahmed.  
Pakistan suffered a severe power crisis in the last decade, forcing it to explore other means of producing energy. Power outages of over 10 hours or 16 hours were reported daily across the country. As a result, the demand for solar panels grew exponentially.
Today, most city-dwellers still choose to rely on traditional energy, but rural villages, especially in Sindh, are taking a new approach to power thanks to the availability of cheap Chinese PVs. According to Karachi’s Electronics Dealers Association, on average around 15 containers of solar panels, batteries and convectors arrive at the city’s port every day from China. Out of the stock, 75 per cent is sold to rural areas.
While falling PV prices have been welcome for many in South Asia, it has put the government of India in a dilemma.  While the falling prices have sped-up energy transition in Pakistan and Nepal, in India, it might have done the opposite, experts warn.
As of March 31, 2014, India had a total installed solar capacity of 2631.93 MW. By the end of November 2019, the number grew to 32527.55 MW, a jump of more than 1,100%. In contrast to ‘Make In India’ schemes that the current government emphasised on, this growth was possible only because of cheap panels sold by China.  
In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha in August 2018, the minister of state for commerce and industry C R Chaudhary said that 89 per cent of all solar imports were from China as these panels were cheaper than those manufactured in India. His reply came a month after the Indian government announced a safeguard duty on the import of solar cells and modules for a two-year period starting 30th July 2018 to safeguard the interests of Indian manufacturers, mainly against cheap Chinese PVs.

Similarly, cheap Chinese goods, including solar panels became a headache for the Modi government, which abruptly pulled out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a free trade agreement between 10 countries in the Asia Pacific region, including China. The agreement would have allowed Chinese PVs unfettered access to Indian markets. 
An analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), concludes that the government’s decision to impose a safeguard duty on imports of solar cells and modules from China and Malaysia on July 30, 2018, has failed to achieve the objective of nudging the domestic firms to manufacture equipment for generating solar energy. According to industry experts, the safeguard duty on imports, which was set at 25 per cent for the first year and 20  per cent and 15 per cent for the subsequent six months, translated to a 10-15 per cent increase (Rs25-30p) in solar tariffs across the board. As a result, the price of solar in India is now climbed to Rs2.70-3.00/kWh, vs the record lows of 2.44/kWh.
“The bigger impact was the loss of momentum across India and the increased financial risks associated with political policy inconsistency,” said Tim Buckley, Director of Energy Finance Studies, Australia/South Asia for the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Buckley says that the delay in the government’s announcement of safeguard duty, which was under discussion for a long time, meant that 12-18 months of industry growth and momentum was lost
“Even to-date solar developers have not been reimbursed for the duty impact of projects tendered and won prior to the implementation of this charge. So the impact has been extremely costly for Indian electricity consumers, and project developers and there have probably been $10-15bn of new investment in India forfeited through this policy mis-step,” explained Buckley. 
With China leading the way in innovation, technology and price of PVs, energy experts in the region are calling on decision-makers to allow China to do what it does best. Kulman Ghising, the MD of Nepal Electricity Authority says that it is now time for South Asia to cooperate on energy based on this principle.  He says, “The demand for power in India has crossed 150,000 MW. If it is to follow the trajectory of China, it will need 2.5 million MW in the near future.” Ghising proposes that as China has specialised in solar power and the Tibetan region is one of the best places for solar plants, China should take the lead in solar power. “If we are to concentrate the region’s solar power in Tibet, the price of power will drastically fall in South Asia,” he said, adding that China and Nepal are now working on a cross-border transmission line that could make his vision possible.
Meanwhile, Buckley says that China is subsidising the export of ever-lower cost, world-leading technology solar modules to India, in effect subsidising Indian solar-generated electricity. “ It may be defeatist to say India can’t really compete in this particular product segment of solar module manufacturing, particularly while the technology innovation is still happening at such a fast rate of knots – China has too much a head start – so grab the huge opportunity to transform, decarbonise and drive deflationary energy generation in India and look to manufacturing and investment gains elsewhere that open up as a result.”
Gham Power CEO Niraula is optimistic that solar power is the key to energy transition in South Asia. “It’s going to be decentralised, it’s going to renewable and it will be digital. Storage and infrastructure will remain the key.”
“I see solar massive potential. Within a few years, solar PVs will be a common sight on all houses in Kathmandu. What we need to do is get all the stakeholders together and focus on building the right policies for the future.”

The Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs is organising simultaneous consultations in various parts of the country today. The ministry says a consultation lasts for around three hours, but Bhagiram Chaudhary, who led the demonstration, says it is too short.
“This is just a drama and we conclude that the government cannot collect real suggestions of the victims from it,” he claims.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/exam-rigging-exposes-nepals-faulty-education-system.html,"A nexus of corrupt school administrators, government officials, parents, and teachers has turned higher secondary level exams into a sham.

Madhav Nepal has no doubt about what he saw over several mornings, in May 2018, on the playground of the Laxmi Secondary School in eastern Nepal’s Jhapa district.
Over 800 students from neighbouring schools were taking their grade 11 exams at the school that month. Nepal, a teacher at the school, was invigilating the exams in one of the classrooms. Between the long hours of invigilating, Nepal often stepped out of the classroom to stroll on the playground. On several occasions, he came across Ghanashyam Dangi, his colleague and assistant principal of the school, wandering about the ground donning his usual ‘French-cut’ beard and sunglasses.
When the results of those exams came out five months later, Nepal was taken by surprise. Dangi, who never took exams, had passed, with a GPA of 2.98, as a student of the Sanischare Secondary School. If passing was not enough, he had topped the exams among the students from that school.
“I didn’t see Dangi take any of the five exams,” Nepal says. “And yet he topped the exams. This is shocking and mysterious.”
Half dozen locals from Jhapa’s Arjundhara municipality spoke to Onlinekhabar and corroborated Madhav Nepal’s allegations: Dangi never appeared for an exam in May that year. They claim that Dangi had made his wife, Maya Gautam, also a teacher at the same school, take those exams.
The locals also claim Dangi sent Gautam to the exam hall in cahoots with Birendra Prasad Gupta, principal of the Laxmi Secondary School. To execute the fraud effectively, the locals say, Gupta appointed Dangi the assistant chief of the exam centre.
But things didn’t go as they planned. Dangi landed in the soup when Nepal and others spoke out. Locals formed a protest committee and asked Dangi and Gupta to resign, and the government formed a probe committee to look into the accusations.
Laxmi Secondary School in Jhapa
When Onlinekhabar telephoned Dangi to seek his comments on the case, his wife answered the call. “The probe committee clearly says we are clean. The issue is over,” she said.
Dangi is neither the first nor the last person to manipulate Nepal’s school examination system. A two-month investigation by Onlinekhabar reveals that Government officials, school administrators, teachers, and guardians use their financial, political and administrative resources to manoeuver the system to work in their favour. And with legal loopholes and impunity that abound, the offenders perpetrate the offence, unchecked, for years.
Faulty mechanism
Multiple local sources Onlinekhabar spoke to–teachers, activists, and villagers–claim Dangi took admission at Sanischare School knowing his exam centre would be the Laxmi School, where he calls the shots. And his ploy paid off, albeit partially because the Board adopts a ‘faulty’ procedure to assign exam centres.
Established three years ago, the Board, which succeeds the Higher Secondary Education Board, is yet to frame rules for conducting examinations.
“We are still in the transitional phase,” says Krishna Prasad Sharma, acting controller of examinations.
Jayanti Satyal, former deputy controller and spokesperson for the then Higher Secondary Education Board, says a number of factors need to be taken into consideration while assigning exam centres. The factors she lists include the availability of classrooms and other basic amenities, the distance between the school of examinees and the host school, and the number of students enrolled. These are based on an HSEB regulation implemented in 1998. The regulation, however, does not define these factors in detail. This means that some schools can host the same school’s examinees for years.

Although the Board uses a two-decade-old regulation, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology has issued several directives to amend its various provisions on an ad hoc basis. On April 6, 2011, the Ministry issued an order authorising a three-member district committee comprising the chief district officer, the district police chief and the district education officer to assign exam centres for grades 11 and 12.
Five years later, in 2016, the Ministry added the local development officer and the district chiefs of the Nepal Army, the Armed Police Force and the National Investigation Department to the committee.
But these changes, made at the district level, did not make any impact at the local level, where school principals and their confidants are in charge.
Moreover, even when they face allegations of misconduct, they get away with little or no punishment.
The Dangi case also exemplifies the lethargy that besets administrators responsible for taking actions against those sabotaging the exam system. After the protest committee led a sustained offensive against Dangi and Gupta, the then Chief District Officer Janak Raj Dahal assigned the District Education Officer Jaya Prasad Mahat, who was transferred to the district just a few days before the protest, to look into the case. Mahat now claims Gupta and Dangi are inculpable as per the documents he was provided with during his investigation.
However, BhishmaPaudel, who led the protest committee, claims Mahat and the other officers involved in the case were coerced into inaction by local politicians.
Mahat admits there were shortcomings in the process. “We are not an authority to investigate in-depth and take action.”
Institutional irregularities
A former teacher (who wishes to remain anonymous) at Brilliant Multiple Campus, a higher secondary school located at Chabahil in Kathmandu, recalls how invigilators including himself were instructed not to take action against students of Golden Gate International College sitting for grade 12 exams in April 2017. (Most private higher secondary schools in Kathmandu identify themselves as a ‘college’ rather than a ‘school’.)
“It was done in a subtle manner,” he says. “The instructions came from lower-level staff such as security guards. We were asked to allow Golden Gate students to do anything they wanted except make noise.”
Three Golden Gate students who took their grade 12 exams in April 2016 also say their schoolmates copied answers from one another even as invigilators at Brilliant looked the other way.
Housed in an eight-storey imposing building at Battisputali in central Kathmandu, Golden Gate is among the expensive schools in Kathmandu
Housed in an eight-storey imposing building at Battisputali in central Kathmandu, Golden Gate is among the expensive schools in Kathmandu, with annual tuition fees going upwards of Rs 100,000 per student. It draws its authority from its association with its founder and CEO, Ramesh Silwal. Silwal is the chairman of the Higher Institutions and Secondary Schools’ Association Nepal, which holds sway in the formulation of the country’s education policy, and is also the member-secretary of the National Sports Council. He is also known to have close ties with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and the ruling Nepal Communist Party.
Unlike the Golden Gate, Brilliant mostly attracts students from lower-middle-class backgrounds. It charges around 30,000 rupees per student annually. Its principal, Durga Prasad Nepal, did not respond to Onlinekhabar’s request for comment.
Silwal claims to be committed to fair and transparent exams and says he has never lobbied to ensure flexible exam norms for his students. “If this had been the case, I’d have ensured 100 percent pass results,” he says.
However, Board officials acknowledge that high schools in Kathmandu use their clout to manipulate exam results, which are vital for publicity of the schools: the higher the pass percentage, the more the students getting enrolled the following year.
Brilliant Multiple Campus, Chabahil, Kathmandu
A former examination controller, who is now associated with a different department of the Board and wishes to remain anonymous, says the Board leadership is unwilling to take action against the irregularities in the exam system. He claims the schools located in the Kathmandu Valley are ahead of other institutions in terms of using political and financial clout to rig the system. He himself was allegedly relieved from his position in 2018 after a ‘powerful’ school’s founder was barred from sitting in the subject evaluation committee due to a conflict of interest.
Former HSEB spokesperson Satyal corroborates the former controller’s claims. She says investors are often affiliated with more than one school without the knowledge of the Board. The same investor might be affiliated with the host school and the school of the examinees, in which case exam ethics are most likely to be compromised.
Another Board official who wishes to remain anonymous says whereas the Board notifies exam centres outside the valley a month before the exams begin, there is just a two-day window for the purpose when it concerns the Valley. “This is because power brokers take time to choose exam centres of their liking,” he says, adding that at least 20 percent exam centres in the valley are rigged.
Greedy officials
Onlinekhabar’s investigation reveals that power brokers do not need any political connection to access the Board officials and tamper with the system. Bribery, the former examination controller says, is a common practice at the Board.
Educationist Mana Prasad Wagley says Board officials’ financial greed is what keeps the fraud going. “This is a form of corruption that originates due to the lack of accountability among officials,” he adds.
More than a dozen teachers from schools across Nepal Onlinekhabar spoke to concur that wealthy schools also bribe officials of their exam centres directly to ensure that the invigilators ‘support’ their students.
Principals of two Kathmandu-based secondary schools who wish to remain anonymous agree that almost every private school in the capital city buys the support of invigilators. A school earns thousands of rupees from a student every year, and if it spends Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000, it can improve the results of all students for that year.
“It’s not only possible but is practical as well,” says one of the principals.
The exam centres also expect kickbacks. If they fail to receive it, they direct their anger at the students of those schools. “I know that an exam centre in my neighbourhood gave unnecessary trouble to the students of two schools that failed to bribe,” says the principal.
‘Supportive’ guardians
While students, officials, and school administrators try to rig the exams to suit their interests, guardians also use their influence to help their children cheat.
On April 27, 2019, a group of guardians of students studying at the Srijana Secondary School in Pokhara organised a party for the invigilators of the government-run Barahi School. A source familiar with the school says the invigilators, who were assigned to oversee grade 12 exams scheduled to begin the next day, were taken to a restaurant in Pame, a small, touristy area near the Lakeside in Pokhara.
“They were offered the restaurant’s signature fish dishes and drinks,” says the source. “After the party was over, the invigilators agreed to help the students pass the exams.”
However, the Barahi School administration learned of the party the next day and relieved the invigilators of their duties. Though both the schools refuse to acknowledge the incident officially, a source close to the Barahi School principal confirms the incident.
These are only the symptoms of a larger problem plaguing the country’s examination system, say experts. The problem may seem confined toJhapa, Kathmandu, and Pokhara, but is likely to have spread across the country.
SuprabhatBhandari, president of the Nepal Guardians Federation, a coordinating body of 10 guardians’ organisations, says he has heard of many such cases in the remote Karnali region over the past few years.
Santosh Aryal, a former examination controller, says schools in many parts of the country bargain with the Board to find their favorable exam centres every year. He, however, claims exam centre-fixing has ended in the Kathmandu valley.
Root causes
When exam centres are guarded by army and police personnel instead of teachers, students and guardians perceive exams as being ‘tough’, according to Suprakhat Bhandari.
Educationists and administrators alike say systemic failures have led to the perpetuation of exam rigging in Nepal. For Bhandari of the Nepal Guardians Federation, authorising the ‘non-educational’ body to fix exam centres is in itself faulty. He claims ‘powerful’ institutions, local politicians and bureaucrats can easily influence district-level government officials as was evident in the probe into the Dangicase.
Bhandari adds that the Nepali practice of assigning security officials to conduct exams is against the globally accepted principles of education administration. When exam centres are guarded by army and police personnel instead of teachers, students and guardians perceive exams as being ‘tough’. So, they seek to ‘make them easy’, which means they get involved in rigging. When an exam is considered a security issue, it paradoxically promotes rigging.
Bhandari adds that most Nepali guardians believe certificates are more important than practical skills learned by a student. He, however, blames various government policies for imparting this fallacy on innocent’ guardians. He describes the three-hour examination system practiced at the school-level in Nepal since the beginning of the School Leaving Certificate (Grade 10) exam, now renamed as Secondary Education Examination, in 1934 AD as ‘unscientific’. In this system, any student who studies hard throughout the year might fail, if he or she falls sick on the exam day. With little means to evaluate their performance around the year, the students internalise that what matters most is the score.
For Bhandari, this false notion motivates both students and guardians to get involved in the activities that amount to rigging. But he maintains that most of the present irregularities happen due to mala fide intentions of the students, parents, and officials, and not faulty policies.
Mahashram Sharma, a former secretary at the Ministry of Education, agrees with Bhandari. He says the education system in Nepal has failed to perceive examination as an ‘educational’ event. “We should have considered exams an affair between teachers and students, and teachers should have been given the authority to evaluate,” he says.
“Examinations are fair at some places whereas there are irregularities at other places,” Sharma says. “Had it been a policy issue, the irregularities should have existed everywhere.”
Sharma gives a historical example to substantiate his argument that, in this case, the intention is a more crucial factor than policy. Since the beginning, the government announced the names of ‘board first’ students (among boys and girls) while publishing SLC exam results. However, it abolished the tradition around a decade ago when it realised that tradition promoted unhealthy competition among wealthy schools. The tradition had a genuine objective of motivating studious students, but people with mala fide intentions found a loophole in the process and played foul.
Reforming the system
Educationist Wagley says an entirely new procedure should be adopted to eliminate the possibilities of creating loopholes in the system and affecting the results. He says the authorities can, for instance, divide schools into clusters based on their geographic proximity and draw lots to decide which school is allotted to a particular exam centre. Also, they can send students of one school to multiple exam centres so that the school finds it difficult to influence the performance of each student differently, Wagley adds.
File: SLC exam in Rautahat
But Sharma and Bhandari say the problem has spread across the collective unconscious of the society, and that policy or procedural reforms might not work unless there is a change in the mindset of the people.
According to Sharma, local governments, which are constitutionally mandated to manage the secondary education system, should take initiatives to address the problem. Likewise, schools should stop promoting their pass percentage and individual students’ scores to attract more students and instead make teachers responsible for the qualitative and holistic growth of the students, he adds.
“So far, we’ve failed to learn what education is and how one should prepare for an exam,” Sharma says. “We need to change the entire modality. This is a big transformation, and it takes time.”

Kathmandu, January 12
After nearly two years after the formation of the provincial government, the Provincial Assembly in Province 3 has been successful in naming the province. A meeting of the legislative body held on Sunday morning decided to name the province as Bagmati and establish its capital in Hetaunda city of Makawanpur district.
Hetaunda has been functioning as the provisional provincial capital for the past few years. Hence, the Provincial Assembly’s meeting was also held there.
Owing to different views inside and among major parties, the assembly had been unable to decide the name and the capital. In its bid to end the stalemate, the ruling Nepal Communist Party’s central secretariat had recently directed its provincial lawmakers to propose Bagmati and Hetaunda as the name and capital respectively.
Despite protests of a few lawmakers, the NCP provincial parliamentary party had endorsed the secretariat’s directive last week.
Whereas the assembly received only one proposal regarding the name, the Bibeksheel Nepali Party, which has three lawmakers, had proposed Dhulikhel as the capital. However, the meeting on Sunday endorsed the ruling party’s proposal and reject the Bibeksheel’s. The main opposition Nepali Congress had supported the NCP in the proposal.
Consequently, Chief Minister Dor Mani Paudel’s proposal for Hetaunda received 105 votes.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/selfie-king-movie-review-powerful-tragedy-in-mediocre-making.html,"
Don’t ever think that a movie with a clown as the hero is always a comedy. This week’s Kollywood release ‘Selfie King’ is the exact opposite (though, surprisingly, the cinemas in Kathmandu are promoting it as a ‘comedy’). Selfie King, precisely, is a tragedy–about a comedian’s life.
Presenting acclaimed Bipin Karki as the title character, debuting director Bishal Sapkota has done a commendable job in filming the emotional story that he wrote. Though the way the movie unfolds is full of flaws, the project, besides entertaining the audience, makes them contemplate what it means to be a ‘celebrity’.
The ‘deceiving’ tragedy
Our hero is a comedian who hosts a popular television show. He is known across the country–as the Selfie King, who is ever ready to crack jokes and make the audience laugh. If the movie had been about his public life, it could have been considered a comedy. But it is all about his personal and family life, which essentially is tragic. Hence, some spectators might find this movie ‘deceiving’–it promises you a comedy, but delivers something else.
Like the classical tragedies, this movie ends in loss and despair. The first scene shows you a happy family–an ageing couple watches their ‘celebrity’ son on the television show. Despite the father’s complaints about the celebrity’s earning, the mother is proud of him. Moreover, she is hopeful that the son can address the father’s complaints also.
As the story moves, the dad’s complaints thicken and the mom’s hopes fade. In the end, the ‘intermediate’ hero realises that his own hamartia (tragic flaw) has led him to the downfall. Readers of Sophocles are prone to likening the weeping Selfie King of the final scene to the self-blinding Oedipus Rex of the super-celebrated Greek tragedy.
The burden of fame
But, ironically, the audience is generally unknown about the personal life of a celebrity–even though they are fans of him/her. The movie, hence, attempts to expose this irony. From the beginning to the end, Selfie King is all about the comedian’s way of dealing with real-life situations.

In doing so, our hero is not successful in living a life that he wanted. He finds himself lingering with the burden of fame. On the one hand, he fails to meet the expectations of his family members; on the other, he is compelled to present himself as a celebrity in the public sphere. He finds himself trapped between the real and the fake. It forces him to hide from both situations.
This is apparent in his mismatching behaviours. He visits a hospital and a funeral ghat as a clown, in heavy make-up and funny clothes. But, whenever he is in the public space such as roads and eateries, he is masked because our hero fears attention though he loves popularity. Psychologically, these two seemingly contrasting scenes mean the same: he does not want to, or cannot, live the life that he is supposed to live. He is a coward, crushed by the tension between private and public expectations.
But, the public rarely thinks that the celebrity’s life is filled with desperate efforts of making and faking impressions, which may not always match real life. The movie blatantly exposes it–when his fans laugh in his ‘real’ cry. The scene, being the crux of the plot, tells a lot about the price of fandom.
Mediocre presentation
Given the vigour of psychologically charged story, the first half of the movie looks bleak. Cheap tools for catching the average audience’s attention get priority there: the hero’s excessive love of alcohol leading him to several arguments, his extramarital affair, and his lame efforts to lie to the interrogating wife. Also, there are a few semi-vulgar words; there is one scene during which the hero shows his private organ to another man (though it is hidden from the camera). As the movie opens, you feel that you are watching another comedy like Chauka Dau and Garud Puran, two of the worst movies of the last year.

There are technical flaws too. Why is the scene that shows the back of the hero’s jacket repeated many times? Why is the scene involving four people–the hero, another comedian, the singer and the local event organiser–longer than five minutes? Moreover, why is the camera angle static here?
A few incidents are unrealistic. The decisive scene in which the dad falls unconscious while watching TV is essentially dramatic: he laughs so loudly and for a long time, in contrast to his own opinion about the TV show, ultimately his nose bleeds and he blacks out. Likewise, the way that the wife, in the hospital, asks the hero about his whereabouts the previous night cannot be relatable to real life.
The flaws are not limited to the first half, and to the presentation. The story itself has several holes. Throughout the movie, you do not understand why people force the Selfie King to do something that he does not like. For example, the event manager in Salleri once literally pushes him onto the stage. The way the ‘King’ is treated does not match the impression that he has left in his audience. Unlike other performers, he is deprived of an air ticket to go to Salleri. The owner of a roadside eatery, who claims that his family members are fans of the Selfie King, first irritates him by giving a torn banknote in change and engages in a short quibble after that. Even the hotel staff do not give him a mobile adapter. Consequently, the central theme of the movie, ordeals of the stardom, looks more forced than smooth and natural.
Nevertheless, the movie keeps you hooked because it does not deviate from its purpose and theme.

Then there are efficient actors who are capable of compensating the oversights. Bipin Karki is on a par with the audience’s expectations from him. His female companion in the movie, Laxmi Bardewa, also does not disappoint you. But, the story itself limits her role in a few scenes only. Otherwise, Bardewa could have advanced herself from her promising competence in Bulbul. Abhay Baral catches everyone’s attention; he looks natural and spontaneous. Baral deserves more important roles in the next productions. Sabin Bastola gets shorter screen time, but he makes the first half lively with his joke-like but real-life anecdotes. Jiban Bhattarai also leaves an impression on the audience. Lokmani Sapkota and Bhuwan Chand are okay.
Verdict
Selfie King’s strength is its story, not the making. It is a ruthless revelation of the tragedy of a comedian’s life. The young director needs to improve his presentation skills to quench the Nepali audience’s thirst for ‘good movies’.

As the new session of Provincial Assembly has begun, debates over the new name of the Province 1 has gained momentum again. Chief Minister Sher Dhan Rai wants to name the province from this session.
It has been around one year since the legislative body finalised the provincial capital. Then, the issue of name was put on hold after many lawmakers including those affiliated with the ruling Nepal Communist Party demanded that the name reflect the identity of ethnic groups dominant in the region. However, the new name is unlikely to meet the demand.
After four provinces–Bagmati, Gandaki, Karnali and Sudurpaschim–finalised their names based on their geographic features, the Province 1 is also likely to follow suit. Further, the central leadership of the ruling NCP had directed the provincial lawmakers to name Province 3 Bagmati. Hence, the Province 1 lawmakers also fear that the leadership would interfere if they tried to name the province based on ethnic identity.

The minister hopes that other companies will also gradually obtain approval, adding the ban has turned ineffective at least for the case of Nepal.
India had introduced the ban in the first week of January and it had affected Nepali traders also. Nepali officials had urged their Indian counterparts to withdraw the ban.
Though Nepal does not produce palm oil, it has been one of the largest exports of the country.
As Indian traders can buy the palm oil that Nepali traders sell after importing it from the countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia at a cheaper rate than purchasing it from Malaysian traders directly, the Nepali firms are enthusiastically trading it. The imbalance exists as India imposes a high tax rate on the import of items from countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.

At the age of 11, Sabin (name changed) started watching adult movies. He was redirected to a porn site while watching a Hindi movie online.
When his parents put a tablet in his hands, he got access to the world of online porn. Coming from a well-off family, he had his own room, where he used to stay inside for hours, locked, just watching porn. His parents had no idea what the young boy was learning from the tablet they had given him, with love.
Things got out of hand, and the young boy attempted to sexually assault the domestic worker the family had while his parents were not home. The girl got out of the house unhurt, yet did not tell the family.
Her family later called the child helpline (1098) and with the help of psychologists, who questioned both the children and found out proofs of the assault, along with Sabin’s addiction to porn.
The incident was reported, however, only after the 35-day deadline. Hence, the police did not file a case at the court.

Around a year ago, an unusual call left a staffer at the 1098 helpline astounded. Three boys, of under five years of age, reportedly tried to sexually assault a female classmate at a school in Pokhara. The police found themselves at a pinch to investigate further, legally.
According to section 1 of the Children’s Act, 2018, any child under the age of 10 will not be charged with any legal actions and no penalty or punishment will be imposed on her/him. Hence, the police solved the matter with the parents of the kids and brought them to an understanding.

According to advocate Tika Prasad Sharma Kandel, “It seemed like the boy had no remorse or realisation that he had done something wrong despite that his obscene behaviours against the girl were ongoing already for a few years.”

During the police investigation, it was revealed that the boy began watching porn from a very young age. He is a single child, from a well-off family with no monitoring from the parents about what he was doing.
An officer involved in the investigation says the boy attacked the neighbouring girl after watching a porn movie. “We found porn videos on his mobile.”
Since he was a minor, he was released on a general date and now is in a juvenile detention centre.
Porn and violence
According to a study by the Child Workers In Nepal (CWIN), an NGO working in Nepal for children, 82 per cent of the children in Nepal use the internet. Out of that, 73.7 per cent of the boys and 26.3 per cent of the girls share personal information with strangers.
Likewise, 3.9 per cent of the children surveyed in the study had one porn website among their top five websites whereas 11 per cent of the children were found exchanging ‘obscene’ texts and photos with various people via the internet. And, more significantly, 66.6 per cent of the children were found watching adult movies.
According to CWIN Project Manager Bharat Adhikari, the 1098 helpline gets 150 calls of sexual assault on average every year. Among them, children below 10 are involved in about five to 10 cases.
A former chief of Women, Children and Senior Citizen Service Directorate in Nepal Police, Pitambar Adhikari, says that there has been an influence of porn or adult movies in the majority of rape cases filed. Adhikari says, “Rape is a crime that originates in one’s psychological state and porn or any adult movie influences that state of mind.” When the perpetrator is a minor, it creates further complications in the legal proceedings, he adds.
Parents and porn
Krishna Thapa, the director at Voice of Children, another child rights NGO, says technologies such as the internet are being misused rather than being used, and it is promoting child sexual abuse. “Today, mobile phones and gadgets are being used as a medium to engage the children. And while browsing YouTube and other sites, they do encounter some kind of obscene videos.”
“Children are curious by nature, and when they encounter these videos, they tend to search it further. Parents are not giving enough time to their children and this adds onto the problem too. And even when the children learn some foul words and ask their parents about their meanings, they get scolded instead. They do not take time to teach the child about the difference between right and wrong.”

Director Thapa says the increase in children’s involvement in sexual activities is not just because of the porn sites. Nepal Telecommunications Authority has already banned porn sites or obscene audio/visual websites, but it is not enough, says psychologist Karuna Kunwar. “Even after the ban, such contents are easily available on YouTube and similar websites and this too affects the children.”
She is in favour of stopping access to obscene websites for children under 18 years of age completely. When children at a young age learn the things that they should have learned only after a certain age, they want to practise them. For example, not knowing that it is rape, children are liable to committing rape as for them they are just copying what they have seen, she elaborates. “There is a lack of sex education in the home and school environment.”
Grave effects
Psychologist Kunwar says when children watch adult movies, negative thoughts including irritation increase, diverting their focus from their studies. They prefer to stay alone or with friends. In many cases, they have insomnia. Some even lose their appetite.
Such children also tend to marry early and treat people like objects. They are as concerning as rape, Kunwar adds.",/lifestyle,"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 02:46:07 +0000"

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/slugging-it-out-on-two-wheels-the-langtang-ride-ii.html,"(Read the first part of the story.)
At daybreak, the burgeoning Sherpa Gaun (2,563m) looked like in the making of a miniature town. Blue corrugated zinc-roofed houses seemed to replace the once slate-roofed hamlet. And, as the village turned into a frequent stopover for the Langtang Valley trekkers, the place seemed marked by much life and activity.
After a hearty breakfast, the bikers prepared themselves to hit the trail. “First thing first, give your bikes a once-over. You have to care for them, too,” the skipper, Khashing Rai, barked out. The group hastened to dust their bikes, check the brakes and lightly lube the chains.
Khashing sticks out his thumb to show the way. A mani wall flanks the left side of the road.
Everybody was ready for newer challenges, for all that their muscles ached and their limbs groaned with the last two days’ ride. After something like two hours on the trail, riding and pushing, the team leader asked the team to take a short break. “Guys, now prepare yourself for the worse—the toughest section of our trip as it will bear lugging for the most part—so full steam ahead,” summoned the team leader. “Aye, aye, Sir,” Shishir quipped and gave the Cub Scout salute.
Diwash, on the other hand, looked daggers at Khashing. He did not expect the trail to be that gruelling. Nobody did. But everyone was duly drilled that the track was trekking and not a cycling route.  “I almost felt like bashing him up at that moment,” lamented Diwash mock-seriously to me during our brief meet for the story.
The track first intervened daunting cliffs, once said to have trodden by the mule trains. Needless to say that one look at the sheer drops gave you the creeps. One false move could prove fatal. Shishir bravely acted like the Good Samaritan and assisted the lady riders. Anamica and Rojisha, though, kept their aplomb despite the punishing progress.
To Thangshyap
A little after the ordeal, the group arrived at a small hamlet called Rimche and stopped for a breather, their lungs bursting at the seams. After something like a half-an-hour, they reached Lama Hotel. Curiously, the small settlement previously named Changtang came to be called Lama Hotel when the route became popular, and the first-ever hotel offering food and accommodation to the weary trekkers happened to be the Lama Hotel. And the name stayed that way. Several lodges and teahouses huddled together in a cluster.
After a deserving tea-break at Rimche, the riders stopped for lunch at a place called Riverside, a small bunch of hamlets close to the Langtang Khola. Everybody looked spent. Little did they know that the forthcoming course until Purano Ghoda Tabela involved mostly lugging the bike on stone steps, going up and down.
Again the lady bikers proved their mettle and did equally well lugging their bikes (a normal mountain bike weighs from 14 to 16 kilos) alongside their male counterparts. In between brief rests, the team continued, but the riders were making very slow progress. As the day wore off, Khashing realised that it would be quite dark by the time they made it to Thangshyap, and the guesthouses might run out of rooms.
Shishir came to the rescue and volunteered to fast-track it to Thangshyap following short-cuts.  He was in Thangshyap in time to book the rooms for the night in the Potala Guesthouse. The name sounded very familiar. Then he recalled a guesthouse with that name at Thamel.
The shadows lengthened as the group kept lugging their bikes. Darkness fell when they finally arrived at Thangshyap, covering 12 km that day.  After supper, everyone hopped into bed early, obviously drained but with the comforting feeling that their final destination lay just 10 kilometres away.  They could not wait for the first call of the rooster at the crack of dawn.
Lady-riders brave it shouldering the bikes.
Day Four saw the riders hit the trail after an early breakfast—their last day to their destination, Kyanjin Gompa, 10 km away.  As the trekking season had begun, the group kept bumping into foreign trekkers—Canadians, Aussies, Germans, South Africans, Malaysians, you name it. One group, what looked like a whole contingent (almost 20 of them) of South Koreans, even stopped to talk with them. It turned out they belonged to an alpine club back home.
Were they surprised to see the riders on the trail? ‘Stunned’ would be the right word as they had not the least bit expected to see mountain bikers on that dangerous trail. What’s more, their jaws dropped when they saw Anamica and Rojisha rubbing shoulders with their male peers.
A little later, they ran into a squad of armed military personnel, who gave them a good dressing-down for recklessly attempting the trail on their bikes. The army guys were doing a routine patrol, keeping a vigil on illegal hunting. They thought the cycling group was nothing but insane. They were beefing about the extra responsibility of rescuing that could weigh upon them should something go wrong. “Just be extra careful,” cautioned the commanding officer. That had a sobering effect on the team.
Old Lantang Village site
Despite three days on the trail, the riders were dying for the view of the great Langtang Range with the towering snow-clad peaks. So far, they only got flitting views of the peaks in the distance. The landscape seemed confined to the undulating craggy hills with lush forests, deep ravines, narrow gorges, and valleys—nevertheless, idyllic because they knew well that they would very soon miss out on them after getting back home.
As the group slogged ahead, they sighted a small Tamang teahouse community called the Gumba village. In another two hours, the riders arrived at the old Langtang Village (3,400 m), the historic disaster site of the April 2015 earthquake.
The morning of April 25, 2015, proved a doomsday for the ill-fated Langtang Village, which sat in a basin directly beneath the south face of the towering Langtang Lirung (7,227 m).  At 11:56 am that day, when the 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal, a massive chunk of Mt Lantang Lirung, fell off bringing in its wake huge boulders and ice floes, almost emptying an entire lake, all crashing through a narrow gulley to slam into the small village.
Nothing but a pile of huge boulders, snow, and mud remained at the site. The massive avalanche took a heavy toll, and the thriving village, with nearly 55 lodges and several teahouses buried. More than 300 people perished with many unaccounted. The death toll included some foreign trekkers, guides, and porters, too.
Earthquake-ravaged old Langtang Village site
The group stopped by the new Langtang Village, relocated some three hours above the earthquake-devastated site. “After almost four years since the earthquake, we are still struggling to reestablish ourselves in this new location,” said one elderly man from the village who had survived the quake. After the group left the new Langtang Village behind, suddenly, Khashing stopped, and his camera caught the first sight of the Langtang Lirung visible through a gap amidst trees.
Langtang Lirung (7,227 m)
The ride on the last day to Kyanjin Gompa seemed very slow, on account of the hard terrain and the elevation. “Guys, we stop for lunch at Mundu. From there, it’s like three more hours to Kyanjin,” informed Khashing. The group tagged along by Shishir arrived at Mundu a little past noon, right on time for lunch. It was after Mundu, the group was rewarded with the spectacular sights of the Himalayas.
Anamica tackles a grassy slope on the way to Mundu. Mt. Ganchenpo (fluted peak, 6,387 m)serves as the perfect backdrop.
It looked the snow-capped mountains were getting closer as they forged ahead towards Kyanjin. That and the comforting feeling that their final destination lay not far away made everyone excited and resuscitated. Diwash, a little withdrawn because of exhaustion, even fell into an animated chat with the rest of the team.
A little rest before a stupa on the track
The rest of the trail brought the riders near and nearer to the towering Langtang range, punctuated by bare hills that rolled out as far as the eyes could see. The team took their time enjoying the panorama.
A little later, the group stopped to watch a herd of yaks grazing on a sloping meadow as a row of peaks soared behind. The bovines seemed to be on their own as no herder was on sight. The scene stole the heart of every rider, and they gawked at the scene, mesmerised.
Dzopkyos (yaks) grazing on the meadows as Mt Yansa Tsenji range stands sentinel.
Kyanjin Gompa
From there on, the group could not resist themselves from frequently stopping for a photo-shoot, or two. It looked, everyone was on a cavorting spree. Being that their destination was just an hour away, the riders took the liberty to indulge in a little time-killing on the virgin landscape. “Pure bliss,” called out Rojisha.
A moment to rejoice!
Reaching for the top! Diwash has his own idea of scaling the peak.
Khashing called out to the group to get going as they’d to make it in time to Kyanjin Gompa and find a lodge for the night. As the trekking season was in, the place might run short of accommodation. Spellbound by the beautiful sight, the riders seemed lulled into a trance and did not wish to make a move. Finally, they hopped onto their saddles. Another hour on the track finally brought the riders to the end of their journey, the Kyanjin Gompa Village.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/its-time-for-nepali-tourism-entrepreneurs-to-make-a-decision-about-the-future-of-elephants.html,"Tourists photograph Lucky, a retired elephant in Chitwan.
When Visit Nepal Year 2020 Secretariat coordinator Suraj Vaidya posted a short video of elephants playing football around two weeks ago, the Nepali twitterati instantly protested, claiming it promoted animal cruelty. Around the same time, dozens of international animal rights activists submitted a memorandum to the government urging it to stop the potential abuse of elephants among other animals during the ambitious tourism campaign.
These two incidents show how the stakeholders and the public want the country’s tourism to change in terms of its treatment of the animals. Whereas hundreds of Nepalis and foreigners are seen riding elephants to tour the Chitwan National Park throughout the year, there have been voices that it is a wrong idea of late.
In this context, Onlinekhabar recent talked to Lena Quénard, the founder of Association Moey, a Swiss nonprofit organisation that has been working for the rights of captive elephants of Asia. The organisation has ‘retired’ an ageing elephant from work in Chitwan and started an alternative programme to promote elephant tourism, which it says it is ethical.
Excerpts:
Why do you find it wrong to ride elephants?
Throughout Asia, it is a popular tourism activity to ride an elephant, with thousands of elephants giving rides to tourists, every day. However, an elephant’s back is not designed to carry a heavy chair with sometimes up to five people weighing over 400 kg. Abscesses and open sores can occur due to pressure from the saddle. Likewise, there could be deep wounds under the tail from the ropes that secure the saddle. All contribute to long-term physical injuries. Elephants often work long hours in the hot sun; they are not fed enough food or given sufficient water causing dehydration and exhaustion. They often walk on hot asphalt surfaces that are not good for their feet, causing painful foot injuries. They also share the roads with buses, trucks, and motorbikes, which is a safety hazard for all.
Wild elephants would not let humans ride them so an elephant must be trained to carry a chair. The training involves various painful methods which break the elephants’ spirit. They have no choice but to become subservient to humans. Nevertheless, captive elephants will always have wild tendencies and be unpredictable; their keepers (mahouts) need to reinforce the training daily.
In the wild, elephants live in large family herds for their entire lives. Separating elephants from their families and forcing them to give rides is also unnatural and cruel. Captive elephants are still wild and will always be. They remind us of this wilderness when they have an opportunity.
But still, there are thousands who find it fun to ride elephants. How can you convince them?
Awareness and education of the cruelty of riding elephants is growing around the world. Many international travel companies do not offer elephant rides anymore; tourists are now choosing more ethical elephant experiences. Bathing an elephant, even if it seems friendly and nice, remains a cruel activity under the control and domination of mahout. Many accidents can happen during this kind of activity.
But there are many ethical alternatives possible. For example, the tourists who visit Chitwan can watch how powerful Lucky Kali, the elephant that we retired, is when left to bathe on her own. When she is really enjoying herself, she slams the water with her trunk playfully and it is obvious that no tourist should be near her in moments like these.
What can those other ethical options be?
This involves seeing elephants in their natural habitat whenever possible; bathing in the river, playing in the mud, and socialising with other elephants. There is so much to learn by watching an elephant’s natural behaviours from a respectful distance. It is a peaceful and meditative experience.
Volunteering to care for elephants also can be a popular activity. The visitors can learn how to cut grass and banana trees, make kuchi (traditional food for elephants in Nepal), and get to know the mahouts and how they live.
There are so many alternatives to riding. In Nepal, elephants are used to go into the jungle for safaris to see the wildlife. The alternative to this would be to use vehicles instead.
I cannot claim to have all the answers, but I am hopeful for a positive solution based on the interest and investment of the large animal welfare organisations which are committed to doing what they can to improve the livelihood of the owners and elephants of Sauraha.
Can you please explain why and how you ‘retired’ Lucky Kali that you claim to be Nepal’s first retired elephant? What is its significance? What are its impacts?
Yes, Lucky is the first privately owned elephant to be retired from work in Sauraha.
In August 2017, she was no longer able to give rides and was due to be sold to a temple in India. In a joint effort by Association Moey and Direct Aid Nepal, we approached her owners and they agreed to lease her for our new ethical alternative project.
Lucky Kali, a ‘retired’ elephant in Chitwan
Thanks to the agreement of Lucky’s owners to work with us, she now lives her days with the people who are careful of her welfare and freedom. Mostly, she walks without a mahout on her back, grazes on grasses, and bathes in the river. She has a chain-free corral; when she is not in the grasslands, she is still free to roam without her legs in chains. I am so proud of Lucky’s owners for taking the risk and agreeing to trust in our idea.
When the project first began, Lucky’s feet were damaged from a long life of work. I have been giving her regular foot care ever since.
Earlier, a study of the foot problems of Nepal elephants was carried out by Dr Bablu Thakur, a scholar at the Department of Veterinary Surgery and Pharmacology in Agriculture and Forestry University, Chitwan. During that research, it was found that Lucky Kali was the only elephant to have no foot afflictions at the time of examination among the 100 elephants observed. The results are yet to be published.
Foot care and freedom are not only for physical but psychological benefits… Lucky’s wellbeing has improved greatly since she has retired, it has improved her health.
Walking on the natural substrate (grass and earth) has also resulted in the healing of her wounds, and when she walks in the grasslands, she now also naturally files her nails.  Today, she is a strong, happy elephant, and a beautiful gentle soul.
An important part of her wellbeing is also having the right mahouts working with her.
What will the end to elephant riding mean to the country’s tourism business and the economy, overall?
Improving the welfare of elephants through ethical elephant tourism also means working with and improving the livelihoods of the people in Nepal. We have a holistic approach to our work. After more than two years since the project started, we have already seen positive changes already taking effect. Lucky has been staying at Sapana Village Lodge, which has its own elephants. Since Lucky has been there, the owner Dhruba Giri, could see the positive reception of the ‘Walk with Lucky’ programme. He has recently stopped offering rides with his elephants, thanks to the support of Direct Aid Nepal, which is very rewarding for me to see.
Likewise, we have been able to train mahouts ethically. We have two men, a father and his son, who are dedicated to our vision and work tirelessly with her best interests at heart.  It is obvious she loves and trusts them.
Quénard with a mahout of Lucky.
We also have hired a young Nepali trekking guide, Sweta Shrestha, to work with her. She can oversee everything and lead the walks with Lucky when I am not in Nepal. These three Nepalis have become like a family to me and I am so fortunate to have them as part of my team and I am happy to be able to give them a job that they can take pride in.
Hopefully, it will be a very positive change and there will be no loss to the economy at all, just replacing one style of activity for another kinder, gentler and more lucrative version.
So what is your vision for future, in relation to elephants of Nepal?
International animal welfare groups are working on a project to have all the privately-owned elephants together in a sanctuary where the owners would receive an income.
Meanwhile, I would like to continue my efforts to inspire lodges to develop ethical activities with their elephants. I would like to take this opportunity to say that my professional team is available for assistance and guidance to anyone who wishes to start an elephant hands-off project in Nepal. We are happy to share our expertise and experience to support those who are willing to make a positive change. Lucky is a beautiful and powerful symbol of change not only for the elephants but for all the community here in Chitwan.
It is a time for the elephant owners of Nepal to make a decision about the future, but I understand they need assistance from outside. Do they want to continue to offer to ride or do they want to rise up and show the world that they can be pioneers and part of an amazing change for the captive Asian elephants?
Today, elephants are disappearing from the planet, and I have a question. How do we want to say goodbye to them: by abusing them every day or by taking the opportunity that we have, to stand up for them and do what is right?

But when you see a group of senior citizens practising t’ai chi, you will feel shocked, right?

There are a lot of stereotypes associated with old age. Now, there is a group of young people working to break such stereotypes. The group has been engaging local grandpas and grannies in various activities involving physical and social activities. Some sway to the music and learn to play the ukulele while some play games on their tabs and others call their children abroad on their own. It reiterates the saying ‘learning has no age’ and becomes proof that you can still celebrate life when you are old.
Interestingly, this group has been doing everything as a business and as a social impact, moving a step forward to the emerging paradigm shift–a change in attitude that not only nonprofit NGOs, but profit-generating companies can also take over social ‘activities’.
What is it?
Bihani Social Venture is the organisation that has been carrying out and encouraging elders to involve in different activities. It introduces itself as a for-profit social enterprise. Established in 2013, it works with people over 50 years of age to enrich their lives and promote healthy living. But it is not strictly for the elders only, but a multi-generational platform for anyone who suffers from isolation or loneliness.

The organisation’s founder says they enable the elderly people to re-engage, re-explore and re-live. They offer a range of programmes and services that are categorised under three main sections: social engagement and participation; health and rehabilitation; and organisational support and enterprise development support.
The organisation provides such services in person-centric and family-centric approaches “because everyone is different”. It offers its services on request–at the time and the place demanded by the client, hence, the company calls it ‘magic of choice’. The pool, which the clients can choose the services from, includes 15 major items such as art, music, self-defence, language, technology, movie screenings, park visits and health care. They even help individuals to enhance and earn from their skills or area of expertise.
Apparently, as corporate social responsibility, the company has also engaged itself in some not-for-profit works like visiting old-age homes, conducting regular health checkups, socio-psychological screenings for free in collaboration with the hospitals and doctors. It makes sure to call the already-served clients on special occasions like birthdays and mother’s day, father’s day or pay them a visit on a regular basis, arrange potlucks so that the elderly do not feel alone.
The Bihani team consists of the core members, volunteers and students along with a network of health experts, geriatricians that actively engage in the work.
Why senior citizens?
The team claims it has a solid reason for its choice of working with the elderly, a practically challenging group, and developing it as a profitable company in the future.
Right now, about 9% of the total population in the world (or 143 million) are above 60 years of age while in Nepal it is over 8% (in 2011 census). By 2030, the expected population of people over 60 will be 16.5% (1.4 billion) with a conversion rate of 56%. The WHO has even declared 2020-2030 as the decade of healthy ageing. Nepal Government also has a separate ministry for the senior citizens.
“The group of elderly will be the fastest-growing population bracket soon. Their concerns are serious and international organisations including the United Nations and the World Health Organisation have tried to address them, with a focus on their health and holistic growth,” says the company’s founder Santoshi Rana.

“We are all going to age; how we age might differ but we will,” she says, “We are working because we understand and believe that every human requires human connections; they want to be loved, cared for and be productive.”
Samridhi Rana, Inclusion Specialist-Disability and Ageing at Bihani, says, “The numbers point at a reality that can happen (in the future), but there are problems already today. There are parents who have been abandoned by their children. There are many who sit alone at home waiting and many who want to live and learn new things, but cannot.

People do not want to imagine themselves old. They also cannot really associate with what it means to be old. Whenever they do, they think of weakness, illness, immobility and they are somehow limited to it,” Santoshi explains, “But the problems go beyond these. They feel lonely, abandoned, helpless, and dependent. People, even their own children treat them poorly. They are busy in their lives; they have less time to see what their parents need. There have been cases where old people commit crimes just so that they get jailed and get to talk to someone.”
“In childhood, parents invest their money, time, give efforts and show patience to us. They take the best care of us and what we need. When we grow up, we should show them the affection and patience and start investing money on their needs and their comfort,” adds Samridhi.
What are the challenges?

But, it’s easier said than done. All the activities that the company has been doing involve many challenges. The very first challenge, according to Santoshi, is to make people understand that it is not a daycare centre or an old-age home. “We provide our services to the elderlies at homes, we do not run an old-age home,” she stresses on people understanding the difference.
The confusion, perhaps, stems from the Nepali society’s unfamiliarity with the idea of social enterprise. People think that we are an NGO or that we provide our services for free. We are a private company with a revenue model that works around a social cause. We charge people for the classes, memberships, and training we conduct,” the entrepreneur clarifies.
Next, ‘the magic of choice’, what the company identifies as a strength has also caused a problem sometimes. “Since our services are for the elderly at their home in their free time, our staff sometimes visit the clients at 7 in the morning, by when the elderly are not ready,” Santoshi says, “For us, having a plan B is not sufficient; we need to have many plans from A to Z.”
Another problem is related to the nature of their clients. “Many old people suffer from dementia, Alzheimer’s, and at times they lose their consciousness and sense of reality. They do not recognise you; they start talking rude or touch you that seems inappropriate,” Samridhi says, “Some even take their clothes off while some try to hurt themselves or us. So it is very important to understand their (medical) history, their intentions. More importantly, we have to understand when to (not) get offended and how to cope up with the sudden demise of the elder.”
To cope with such challenges, Bihani has a code of conduct for its Home Based Service (HBS) providers. This includes guidelines on how to talk to them, what questions to ask, in what tone and how to deal with them. Safety precautions, some facts about the importance of human touch and eye contact while conversing and the line between work and emotions are also parts of the code. They also take training, on a regular basis, on trauma care, psycho-social support, para-professional counselling, and psychological first-aid.

Just last year, the government has been recommended to extend the retirement age to 60 from 58, but senior citizens here get the health benefits and allowance starting at the age of 65, given they have the identification. So, anyone who does not possess identification is deprived of the allowance. One can take any side of the argument to say, but Bihani’s concerns lie on that the Rs 3,000 monthly allowance from the government is not enough for their life today. “It is far better than Rs 500 they used to get back then, but it is still not enough,” states Santoshi.
The lack of geriatric physicians and psychologists in Nepali hospitals is another concern of Bihani. “There are only a handful of geriatricians, but with the provincial government and with Nepal government making laws on paper, we are hopeful of the change in scenario soon,” adds Santoshi.
The situation that the elderly are living today is worrying, but it is not something that cannot change. Founder Santoshi believes teaching the younger generation is the way to go, but they have to be guided by the seniors. “Adding such topic into the syllabus will help, but it will be useless if they do not get support or are encouraged by their parents. Another thing we can do is make people aware of the issue, spend time with parents, grandparents now.”",/lifestyle,"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 05:33:05 +0000"

He submitted the resignation before the series commenced. A CAN source says it has already accepted Patwal’s resignation and agreed with the ICC to bid farewell to the incumbent coach.
The ICC had appointed Patwal to the position for one year in May 2019 when the CAN was suspended. However, he is leaving four months ahead of the expiry of the contract, owing to his differences with the new CAN board, his failure to meet the target and the ICC’s failure to pay him regularly, it has been learned.
A CAN official says the association has begun preparations to appoint the new coach.
When Nepal first started playing international cricket, Tamata was one of the first-generation players. When the team got their ODI status for the first time in 2018, Tamata was the trainer.

Mostly I travel to make a living, but almost every winter, I travel to new places on my own. For such occasions, I choose places that are rich in terms of natural beauty.
As a guide for foreign trekkers, I travel in western Nepal. When there are not many trekkers in the country, I take leave and go on vacation. This time I chose Olangchung Gola, a remote village in northeastern Nepal. Arguably, a very few foreigners and Nepalis have been there as trekkers. I prefer visiting rarely-visited places on my own so that I can lead my clients there in the next season.
—
I left Kathmandu in a foggy, cold February morning. Bikram Angdembe was accompanying me for the 20-day trip.
Olangchung Gola was not a strange place for me; I had heard about it many times. Of late, the village is associated with Nepali ophthalmologist Dr Sanduk Ruit, who was born in this tiny village 65 years ago. However, since I had never got a chance to see the place with my own eyes, I was excited about the journey.
We went there via Guphapokhari before we realised that the way via Phungling Bajaar could have been an easier route. You can take a flight from Kathmandu to Suketar of Taplejung district. There is also a road link for budget tourists.
There are two options to travel to Olangchung Gola from Phungling: trek for the entire route or hire a jeep till the halfway. If you hire the jeep, it can take you to Tapethok in the next five hours. You do not have any option except walking there onwards.
From Tapethok, walk for around two hours and have lunch at Lelep. This place is historically significant as two kings, belonging to Magar and Bhote communities, had fought a war here in the past. The Bhote king won the battle, but he also began to host a special ceremony two times a year in the respect of his opponent. The locals say the tradition still exists.
After a breather there, resume your walk. In the next four hours, you reach Ila Danda. Perhaps Ila Danda is the best option for you to stay overnight for Olangchung Gola is still far away.
Wake up early the next morning and walk for seven hours before you reach your final destination. The seven-hour walk can scare you, but you feel relief when you can find yourself in front of the mesmerising scenery. On the way, there are many waterfalls and monasteries. This route is a perfect place to get a closeup view of the third highest mountain in the world, Kanchenjunga (8,586 m) among other mountains of Nepal and India.
After reaching Olangchung Gola, I found that whatever I had heard about this place was not on a par with the level of beauty this place offers you. The houses in this small village are very much close to each other. The giant hills covered with silvery snow give the place a perfect backdrop.

Stating that in Nepal about 1.6 million people live below the poverty line, he informed the government would pay the premium on their behalf.
“With a premium of Rs 3,500, one can claim Rs 100,000 at present,” said Khatiwada adding, “Those 1.6 million people below the poverty line do not need to pay this, the government will pay on their behalf.”
He also expressed his happiness that 22 per cent of the people have insurance today.",/business,"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 06:25:08 +0000"

Until a few years ago, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) used to make frequent headlines in the Nepali newspapers as the member states including Nepal used to be busy in different activities of the regional body. However, the organisation is less heard in the press these days, apparently due to its failure to hold its summit, the meeting of heads of the states or governments from the member states, since 2014. It seems the organisation is dormant.
In this context, Onlinekhabar recently talked to Amjad Hussain B Sial, the secretary general of the regional body, who is returning his country, Pakistan, next week after completing his three-year term at the SAARC Secretariat in Kathmandu. In the conversation, Sail vehemently rejected the claim that the SAARC is dormant, stating it is not only about the summits.
Excerpts:
 How was your stay in Nepal? What did you enjoy here? What did bore you?
My stay in Nepal has been very useful, meaningful and memorable. In my 36 years of my diplomatic career so far, I spent six years in Nepal, as Secretary General of the SAARC from 2017 to 2020 and as a director (representing Pakistan) at the SAARC Secretariat from 2003 to 2006. This country is known for its diplomatic profile, natural beauty and unique culture. It is a founding member of the SAARC and also the host of the SAARC headquarters and SAARC Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS Centre. Nepal has contributed enormously to the SAARC process. Moreover, Nepali people are friendly and hospitable. I will continue to cherish a happy memory of my assignments in this beautiful country.
What are your next plans ahead? Do they have to do anything with the SAARC?
I do not have any specific plans as such. I will hopefully retire and spend more time with my family. Although my official relationship with the SAARC will end soon, I will always be available for any contribution to its success. As citizens of South Asia, all of us should have faith in the SAARC to promote deeper regional cooperation in the region. Even after my retirement, I will continue to support the SAARC process for promoting the welfare and well-being of the people of this region.
Reviewing your three-year stint, what are recent achievements of the SAARC?
The SAARC is the manifestation of willingness of the countries of South Asia to work together in a spirit of friendship and cooperation to promote peace, stability, amity and progress in the region. It gives me a sense of satisfaction that I have had the opportunity as the Secretary General of SAARC to serve the one-fourth of humanity, living in South Asia.
During my tenure, the SAARC process has made steady progress in agreed priority areas of cooperation. Ten ministerial meetings were held during the past three years, including the three informal meetings of the SAARC Council of Ministers on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Through these meetings, the member states agreed to take forward collective actions and collaboration in the priority areas. In June 2019, the SAARC agriculture ministers adopted ‘the Thimphu Statement on Agriculture and Rural Development’ to deal with the emerging challenges being faced by the region in agriculture and allied sectors. Similarly, in October 2019, the SAARC education ministers adopted ‘the Malé Statement on Education’ and ‘Education 2030: SAARC Framework for Action’.

Besides, the SAARC’s specialised bodies and regional centres have been actively engaged in promoting regional integration. As one of the specialised bodies of the SAARC, the South Asian University (SAU) is offering higher education for our youth. So far, over 1,000 students have graduated at master’s, MPhil and PhD levels in different disciplines and currently about 600 students are pursuing their higher studies in the SAU. A new campus of the SAU is being built by India on 100 acres of land in New Delhi at a cost of USD 141.7 million.
Another specialised body is the SAARC Development Fund (SDF), which is an umbrella financial institution of the SAARC for its sub-regional and regional projects. It has USD 1.5 billion authorised capital. So far, it has successfully implemented 48 projects and 44 other projects are under implementation.
Other two specialised bodies of the SAARC, namely, the SAARC Arbitration Council in Islamabad and the SAARC Regional Standards Organisation in Dhaka have also been actively pursuing their mandates.
Besides, we have four regional centres working in specialised fields: the SAARC Agriculture Centre in Dhaka, the SAARC Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS Centre in Kathmandu, the SAARC Energy Centre in Islamabad and the SAARC Cultural Centre in Colombo. A SAARC Supranational Laboratory on TB is being established in the SAARC Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS Centre in Kathmandu, at a cost of USD 1.07 million. Once established, it will be the first of its kind in the region with state-of-the-art facilities. A new complex of the SAARC Cultural Centre is being built on 17 acres of land at Matara, Sri Lanka, with the contribution of USD 10.5 million from Sri Lanka.
The SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme has a great potential to enhance economic relations and tourism, thereby promoting regional integration. We are working on streamlining the scheme and developing its security software for implementation across the region.
The SAARC also has nine observers, including the EU, and we are working on to initiate project-based substantive collaboration with them in seven priority areas.
Though you listed some impressive successes of the organisation, the critics, overall, say the SAARC is a total failure of late. It has been unable to hold even one summit in the past six years. As the top executive official of the body, how do you respond to these comments?
The holding of the summit is of utmost importance. It provides renewed impetus to the SAARC process. The nineteenth SAARC Summit could so far not be held in Islamabad, Pakistan. As we know, in the SAARC, all decisions are taken unanimously. Therefore, the summit will take place when consensus is evolved among the member states. However, we should remember that 18 SAARC summits have been held.

It may not be appropriate to judge the performance of the SAARC solely on the basis of not holding the nineteenth SAARC Summit.  We must not lose sight of the progress that we have achieved and continue to achieve in many projects and proposals that all the member states have agreed on. I am of the view that the SAARC process is moving forward steadily to achieve its objectives as enshrined in the SAARC Charter.
Analysts attribute the failure to hold the summit to the unwillingness of India, the biggest member. Apparently, New Delhi seems to be preferring other consortiums such as the BIMSTEC and the BRICS over the SAARC. Do you agree with this statement?
No, I do not agree.
In accordance with the principles of international law, all member states of the SAARC are equal and they are no big or small. All decisions are taken unanimously according to the SAARC Charter. Referring to your first statement, I wish to underscore that arriving at a consensus is the key to holding a summit. Answering to your second statement, I wish to state that India has been and is an important founding member of the SAARC. It has made valuable contributions to the SAARC process.
Then, how should other members, such as the host of the Secretarial, Nepal, and your own country, Pakistan, work towards ending the deadlock?
As I stated before, the summit will take place when consensus is reached among the member states. I am sure that the member states are working to reach the consensus on holding the next SAARC Summit. The chair of the SAARC (Nepal) has been making efforts for early convening of the summit in Islamabad. Pakistan has been reiterating its offer to host the summit and welcome the leaders of SAARC in Islamabad.
Okay, the summit depends on the political will. It is understandable. What are the other areas that the organisation should prioritise now?
The SAARC represents eight countries in the region that are diverse in terms of size, population, human resource, geography and their levels of socio-economic, industrial and infrastructure development. Some of our countries are landlocked while some are sea-locked islands. Despite these variations, the SAARC can still be an effective vehicle for regional development and prosperity. Similarly, we need to vigorously pursue the objective of attaining better regional connectivity through air, road, rail and sea for promoting regional integration, economic cooperation, trade, tourism and people-to-people contacts.

In this context, I do see the need to finalise early the three important agreements–on motor vehicles, railways and air services–to further improve regional connectivity and integration. More importantly, we need to work more strenuously to be able to deliver dividends of regional cooperation to the common people through project-based collaboration. In the coming decade, we need to work harder to make the SAARC a truly people-centric organisation. We need to work collectively to eradicate poverty, promote education and economic cooperation among the member states. Intra-SAARC trade should also be increased.
But, apparently, there are many problems. If you are asked to recommend solutions to the challenges, what would you say?
Further enhanced regional integration and cooperation among the member states of the SAARC is the only option to overcome the challenges faced by South Asia today. Regular holding of the SAARC summits and other meetings of the charter bodies is of utmost importance to provide renewed political impetus to the SAARC process. Timely and effective implementation of the decisions taken at the national level is another important aspect of making regional cooperative frameworks like the SAARC work effectively.
Finally, what kind of the future is the SAARC approaching?
The SAARC is a beacon of hope for the people in the region. It has the potential to be a vehicle for socio-economic development in South Asia. This is a platform created to promote welfare and wellbeing of the people of this region and in today’s interconnected world, it has greater relevance.
We will have better regional integration and improved connectivity upon implementation of the three agreements I mentioned earlier.  It is also earnestly hoped that the vision of the South Asian Economic Union (SAEU) in a phased and planned manner through a free trade area, a customs union, a common market and a common economic and monetary union, as envisaged by our leaders, will be realised soon.",/interview,"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 03:39:49 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/subas-nembang-ncp-cannot-move-forward-this-way.html,"Subas Chandra Nembang. File image
The ruling Nepal Communist Party, on Saturday, formed a panel to suggest a constitution amendment proposal. However, the panel is certain to fail in its stated mission as its members did not own its existence.
Perhaps the most vocal critic of the so-called task force has been Subas Chandra Nembang, who led the 2015 constitution drafting process as the Constituent Assembly chairman. This calm leader is said to have a greater sense of sensitivity, hence he does not criticise anyone in the public. But why is he speaking against the crucial party decision this time?
When Onlinekhabar asked him this question on Monday, Nembang suggested that the decision exposed that party leadership’s failure to run the party in the right way.
Excerpts:
Though you rejected the existence of the task force, the three members of the panel held an informal meeting this morning. What did you talk about?
As the news about the ‘task force’ and constitution amendment has gone viral, we apparently talked about that issue. I do not think what the media have been reporting about the issue is true. I have not been informed about it, formally and officially. The media have also reported that the decision was made with a condition of keeping it secret.
In a serious matter such as the constitution amendment, this is not the right way to follow. We hope the party has not done so. If the party has really made the decision, this is totally wrong. This will not give any advantage to the party, ourselves and the system.
In reality, the party has been discussing the amendment issue since a long ago. It has been consulting Madhesi parties, such as the Samajwadi Party and the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal, as well as Dalit and Janajati leaders.
We once commented that the amendment demand was an irrelevant issue because the provincial and federal parliaments were not formed then. Now we have the structures and, hence, an amendment is possible. However, the amendment should be rational and should reflect the needs of the country and its people. A party like the NCP should play its role in amending the constitution for the country and the people. Even (drafting or amending) a general legal provision requires extensive discussions with all the parties and stakeholders; the issue of constitution amendment also demands consultations with political parties and the civil society.
But this time, the rationale of the issue has not been established. The decision about the task force came out suddenly. I do not believe it. I asked the senior leader (Madhav Kumar Nepal) to communicate these issues to the party leadership as he is said to be the coordinator of the task force.
After I expressed my views, Khim Lal [Devkota] also seconded me.
Does it suggest that the decision about the task force will not be implemented now?
I have seen the task force’s existence nowhere. I do not know anything about it. How can I comment on the decision?

Fine, you and Devkota questioned the existence. What about the coordinator?
He (Madhav Kumar Nepal) also responded to us positively. He said whatever we said were genuine and appropriate issues.
Can we say that the task force then is a stillborn baby?
I do not know if it was ever conceived. But what I am certain is that a serious and responsible party like the NCP cannot move forward this way.
As a constitutional expert and the leader of the constitution drafting process, we would like to know your opinion about Bamdev Gautam’s demand that a National Assembly member is allowed to become the PM.
I will express my views whenever there is a discussion about it (formally). Let me clarify that there had been sufficient discussions about the issue while drafting the constitution in the Constituent Assembly. We had studied examples from other countries and found that India had such a provision. But, India’s condition is different. Then, we decided on the provision of electing a House of Representatives member as the prime minister.
The decision was made after a rigorous discussion. The parliamentary democratic system envisioned in the constitution is an improved parliamentary system, and the provision of electing a House of Representatives member as the PM is a key component of that improvement.
We also introduced other provisions such as the prime minister does not face any no-confidence motion in the first two years and s/he cannot dissolve the House of Representatives. Such provisions were also incorporated to make sure that those losing the House of Representatives will not become a minister in the next five years.
The question today is: is it appropriate to change the provisions introduced with such an extensive discussion just in the first two years of the first House? I have been stressing that we should move ahead based on our needs and rationale.
So why do you think your party formed the task force? Are not there any leaders in the House of Representatives who are qualified to become the prime minister?
I do not think so. Our comrades, both inside and outside the Federal Parliament, are competent. I do not think the party even discussed this issue from this angle. I even do not believe there was any effort made to change the existing provision about the prime minister’s election.
I have a good rapport with comrade Bamdev. He has never talked with me about this issue. He is in favour of a directly elected prime minister. Whatever has been rumoured now, that he made efforts for this, is not true. This will not do anything good for us.

Your party has been forming so many task forces these days. Doesn’t it suggest that the prime minister as the party chair is losing his grip on the party? What do you think as a leader close to him?
As the prime minister, Oli has been a successful leader. I believe if he ever fails, that will mean our failure also.
But I do not buy your statement that I am close to him. I am close to everyone. Recently, during the standing committee meeting, I had joked that if the party would ever think about expanding the secretariat, I should be included because everyone loved me. I am close to comrade Prachanda (executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal) also. I have closely worked with him regarding many issues.
I believe the party is greater than a person and the country is greater than a party.",/interview,"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 03:02:34 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/at-chiya-station-this-young-man-has-restarted-his-life-after-a-14-year-shutdown.html,"“If, suddenly, one has to be dependent on a wheelchair to make even the slightest move in life, what will they think? Will they think their life has ended? That they have no purpose? The life they thought they would have been living? The path that now lies ahead?
I had all these questions within me and around me the society that would only amplify them. The society that would not encourage me, but just pity me…
‘Wheelchair at this age…?’
‘It should be hard for you to go to the restroom, shouldn’t it?’
‘Poor, you would have achieved many things had not you ended up in a wheelchair…’
That was how I was perceived.
The next day, such questions would be asked again, and with them, the emotional turmoil would reappear. I would feel that there is no purpose in my life. Such feelings had been nailed in my brain and they would hurt me always. My unconscious would tell me that I cannot do anything. People thought they were encouraging me, but all that they did was to discourage me, time after time.
I would feel alone in the crowd. I would get depressed. And all those times, I was dejected.
Everyone has their time, that’s universal. For me, my time was running slower than ever. I would listen to music or read books to pass my time. I felt the books were closer to me than people. They would take me to another world. Although momentary, that would give me happiness.
‘Everyone is sick existentially.’ I had read this line in a book that I do not remember the name of. What I understood after the reading was, ‘If one thinks they are alright, there are two possibilities. They are either living in delusion, or they do not have any mouth to eat or rectum to excrete.’
Another line from the book read, ‘Only those are alright and happy who do not have a mouth or a rectum.’
That line made me feel that even though some people express their sympathy, they are only indulged in their selfishness. They are just there to add more fuel to the fire in the name of sympathy. And they are there to enjoy the fire.
It took me years to understand that. I had to struggle and fail before that. If I had understood this 14 years prior, maybe I would have been much happier. Maybe I would not have faced all these emotional pains that I faced. But bitter or sweet, they were all experiences. And, that is what life is.”

What you read just now is not a monologue of any fictional character. Prabess Sharma says this is what he felt over the past few years. Sitting inside his teashop, Chiya Station, and listening to him feels like watching an emotional movie.
He feels like he is only a character of these stories, but he also thinks he has lived multiple lives during his lifetime. “There are many stories still hidden. And during all of these ups and downs, I feel I was just portraying a tragic character of a story.”
He wished someone would give him courage during his hardest times. He was looking for someone to boost his confidence. But words of pity and sympathy were just killing him inside. And he found friends in books; they proved pivotal in healing his emotions.
Sharma is 28 years old, and he has spent 14 years of his life in a wheelchair. But he feels his actual life has started only a few months ago. He has added a new tag in his identity: Chiya Pasale, a tea shopkeeper.
—
Sharma’s Chiya Station is 100 metres away from Char Dobato intersection in Banepa, where he spends most of his time these days. Being a local, he is familiar with Banep; hence the teashop should not be anything new for him. But, the vigour and courage that he has newly found in him are what excite him these days.
Inspired by the books he read, Sharma recently participated in an entrepreneurship training programme hosted by the World Bank and Nepal Reconstruction Authority. That training ignited the flame of entrepreneurship in him.
His family and friends supported his ambitions. Having spent around two million rupees in his treatment, Sharma arranged half a million rupees for his venture from his friends and relatives.
Because Sharma has designed the interior of the cafe on his own, it is friendly to differently-abled people. He has used old tyres and glass panels as tables, and bamboos are used to make the walls of the café. And, with matka chiya, tea served in small clay pots, as the highlight of the place, the café also has other foods on its menu.
If this venture goes successful, Sharma will move forward with his plan of expanding his franchise to other cities.
—
Fourteen years ago, when Sharma was one of the brightest students in his class, he has dreamed of joining the army. But his dream soon went astray. He started feeling sick out of the blue. He used to puke and have cramps frequently. One day, he started sweating a lot and later his body got ‘paralysed’ below the neck. The cause could not be identified easily. A tumour was diagnosed in his spinal cord later.
Looking at the MRI report, doctors had told the family that had Sharma been brought five months earlier, the tumour would not have grown.
But once the tumour was removed, his legs totally stopped working. He was taken to Spinal Injury and Rehabilitation Centre, just a couple of kilometres away from his home, for physiotherapy sessions. Looking at other patients with worse conditions, he used to convince himself that his condition was not that worse. But many thoughts would keep circling his mind: “What if I could never walk again? What would my friends think? I have become the weakest now, why should I live?”
He used to cry his heart out. He felt he could do nothing than that. Returning to home after six months was not easy. Everyone would just stare at him and he would feel helpless. He wanted to convince himself to be strong, but he could not.
Although he feared that he would not walk again, he made some efforts to walk with the support of a walking stick. His dream to become a military officer had already died. Remembering that day, he says, “What would be more painful than joining the funeral of your own dream?”
But life had not ended. His daily life gradually resumed. He did not leave the school despite his physical condition. However, he grew sick and tired of pity that people expressed on him. He wanted to quit school but felt he did not have alternatives. It had become a part of his life.
He wanted to play with his friends but used to have no one to even talk with. He started feeling alone in the crowd. He tried to hide his walking stick while taking photos during various festivals.
It was still hard for him to accept his reality.
—
He spent 10 years of his life like that, suppressing his feelings. But the worse was yet to come. When he was 24, his whole body got paralysed. Even the doctors were surprised to see that the tumour had reappeared.
Ten years ago, the doctors had said that Sharma had a ‘grade-one’ tumour, which could not grow back once removed; he hence was not afraid.
After six months of rehabilitation, he could again walk with the help of a stick.
Sharma was in the last semester of BBA when he had his second surgery, and he had hoped to have a job after that. But his self-confidence fell down after the rehabilitation. He was more worried than ever about his future.
—
“Till when should I survive on pity and sympathy?” he used to express his grief to his closest friends, “I think my condition will limit me to one place even before I could do something. How can I live like this?”
His friends would console him to not to lose hope, saying they were there for him. But to him, the words were meaningless.
His condition worsened again in 2017 and he could not move after that. Apparently, the tumour had grown again. Now, the doctors told him that it was almost impossible to remove it. Nevertheless, they recommended radiation therapy to treat the tumour. The therapy could better his condition, but there was not any guarantee.
It took 45 days in National Cancer Hospital to remove his tumour, and he spent three more months in the Rehabilitation Centre. Again, he became able to walk with a walking stick, go up and down the stairs. He would cook and wash his clothes.
Now, he had accepted life with a walking stick. And his hope to have a career he dreamed of had rekindled.
But, things turned sour again; his limbs stopped moving. He went to Indian Spinal Injuries Centre and Medanta Hospital in India for treatment. Conducting different medical tests, the doctors said that there was no other alternative at that moment.
Again, those were the most painful days for him. Science had done wonders for others, but it did not mean anything for him. The wheelchair was about to be his lifetime friend when he was only able to accept the walking stick. Thoughts of the past and the future had filled his mind. He would feel dizzy; he would catch chills.
And then he thought about the cruel nature of the society and the same questions that would revolve around him. He even started having suicidal thoughts. His heart was saying death, but his brain would say, “Do not be a coward; you have tolerated everything; why should you die now?”
His nights went sleepless. He had no courage to even get out of the house. He would wonder if he was living his life or just waiting to die. It was then he befriended books. He is sure he would have been depressed and indifferent, without his books.
Inspired by the books, he has now learnt that the society will not change if one cannot accept their reality. He has become an example of overcoming the fear and burden of helplessness.
—
With the ups and downs he faced in his life, he does not want to remember his past now. He does not want to feel depressed anymore.
“A life will go wasted in a corner if the heart is suppressed by a big mass of hopelessness,” he says, “One should try to do something instead of gathering sympathy by telling their story.”
But still, some of his customers ask him what life is. His favourite reply is “experience.”",/lifestyle,"Tue, 03 Mar 2020 04:14:42 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tiktok-and-youtube-make-ordinary-people-viral-to-ridicule-them-at-the-end-of-the-day.html,"Grishma Rai is a young woman, aged 20, originally from Dudhkoshi rural municipality-3 of Solukhumbu district. She migrated to Kathmandu, basically to work, around 14 months ago. Then, she started working as a caretaker at an elderly care centre in Kathmandu. While working at the centre, she came into contact with a nurse, who introduced her to TikTok, a video-sharing social networking site. Rai posted her first Tiktok video in late March 2019.
Between March and July last year, Rai posted dozens of 15-second videos on her TikTok profile, lip-syncing, dancing, singing and doing various other activities. None went viral but she continued posting more videos for the sake of posting.
She has rarely posted any video on the TikTok page after July. However, she suddenly became viral in early January 2020. (She holds a different name on TikTok, which has been hidden here due to privacy concerns.) A few YouTube channels interviewed her, asking her to act, sing and reveal information about her private life.
Though Rai enjoyed the publicity in the first few months, she thinks these days that whatever happening is not right. She has found herself helpless in front of the audience and the YouTubers who ridicule her. Though she has realised that she earned many views, she does not find the experience healthy these days.
Growing frustration amid helplessness
Rai thinks that she has been a target of ‘subscription-hungry’ YouTubers, pranksters, troll and meme pages since a few months ago. Hence she states, “I will not be giving any acting or singing performances in any of my upcoming interviews.” She further adds that she has been requesting all social media users not to highlight certain clips of her interviews and make trolls on her.
However, ironically, she has been unable to keep her promises. Whenever one searches her screen name on YouTube, there appear dozens of video clips in which she is letting others ridicule her. A few of her interviews are in the top trending list on YouTube whereas many people’s Facebook wall is flooded with her cropped interview clips, trolls, memes, and strange Tiktok videos.
There are many people like her. The list includes Gurash Nani, Aghori Baba, and Nikesh Shrestha, to name a few. Some ‘sensitive’ media users have raised questions about why people find pleasure in making fun of such innocent or ignorant people.
Targets of ‘propagandists’
Observing such trends closely, media researcher Ujjwal Acharya states, “Social media, primarily, have been a medium that provides an opportunity for those aspiring artists or people who usually do not have the platform to be popular.” He believes some of them are using it in the right way and there is no harm in acquiring fame with one’s skills and talent. The researcher, however, cautions that it is crucial to look at another side of the issue: how these platforms are being used to become ‘hit’ cheaply.
Adding to this, he says, “There are also some users who use these platforms in a way that is not the desired use of it. There are a lot of YouTubers who are using the tactics that propagandists use. They are trying to find out those people who are basically not ordinary in what they are and interfere in their lives in a way to blow up those cases with the intent of having more views or simply becoming a hit.”
According to Acharya, “Most of the YouTubers (in Nepal) rely on that people like to view things that are exaggerated or blown up, negative, odd and bizarre.” Using this mindset of the people, they haunt those ‘uncommon’ personalities and project them and their acts in a way that can be mocked and trolled at as they are more sellable and attractive in the public.
Acharya comments, “They (the YouTubers, troll, and meme-makers) are not looking into how these tendencies could hamper the order of society as well as the psychosocial health of the people in the long run.”
Serious impacts
Researcher Acharya criticises this trend stating one may get benefits (for example, they may earn money or become hit) from these practices initially; but in the long run, it is not going to help the society. This type of trend on social media puts the credibility of the overall media in question. “People tend to trust media and its content less.”
This kind of trend is also not conducive to social life eventually. Acharya says, “How we live socially is being hampered by these kinds of practices.” The ideal image of celebrities or famed people within the society is spoilt by such trends, he argues.
A psychologist at MARC Nepal, Gopal Dhakal, views, “This ‘bizarre viral phenomenon’ has given birth to the insensitivity within people’s psyche.” He further adds, “People have an inner desire to be famous and when this type of contents are doing good business and creating huge buzz in a society where lies the tradition of following the trends without evaluating their pros and cons, general Nepali people are left to believe that this might be one of the prominent ways to become popular.”
The ultimate solution
Media researcher Acharya views that media and information literacy is the first prime factor that can contribute to a fight against these trends.
He says, “People need to know that every information or content that comes to them is not always true or right information. But in Nepal, where we do not teach this subject compulsorily in any academic institution, the people who have the skills to look at the media, as well as social media contents critically, are very few. In this scenario, people unaware of media and information literacy tend to believe everything that they see in social media.”
For them, a video clip of the news broadcast by the credible media house is as same as some contents produced by a mobile camera., Acharya exemplifies, adding, “It is very crucial to promote media and information literacy among general public so that they could distinguish between the sensible and nonsensical content and have a critical overview of those contents.”",/lifestyle,"Sun, 01 Mar 2020 05:23:46 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/this-singers-growth-reflects-how-nepali-indie-music-is-turning-more-creative-and-inclusive.html,"Jerusha Rai
When Jerusha Rai started writing music in 2011, the Nepali independent or underground music scene had very limited space.
“For many, underground music just meant music in the metal genre, where only boys could usually go to,” she remembers, “The scenario is changing gradually.”
Rai, 28, produces ambient soft rock music and electronic music with an ethnic flavour. This calm singer’s journey into the less-explored genre of Nepali music reflects the changes that the industry is embracing of later, in terms of creativity as well as inclusiveness.
A new level of creativity
Rai’s calmness and creativity can be felt in her songs released in two full-length albums, A Dark Place to Think (her debut album in 2016); and Sunsaan (2019); as well as her mix-tape, We all make mistapes (2015), all released on digital platforms.
Interestingly, Rai considers music as a hobby and pleasure rather than a career. “Music is a spiritual thing,” she says in a soothing voice and glowing eyes. “I think my way of creating music will be corrupted if I ever enter the mainstream industry.”
For her, music needs to be organic. “I like folk music from not only Nepal but also from elsewhere. I find them organic. Belonging to an indigenous community myself, I feel the importance of exploring indigenous music.”
She feels she is evolving with her music, which is ‘sacred’ for her. And it has provided her with good communal experiences.

Writing the experiences and observations
Of the songs she has written, she feels very proud of Barud. “Barud was my first attempt to write in Nepali,” she remembers. “And it was very well-received.”
This is a song written about the Maoist insurgency, and she fondly expresses the emotion of the song.
“Many relatives in my native village had joined the rebels or were taken by the Maoists, and I had to hear many things about them. Even when living in Kathmandu meant I did not experience the horribleness of the war, such news used to affect me deeply and I wrote my feelings in Barud.”
She is very satisfied with the music she produces. “The people who like my songs usually resonate with the feelings my songs express; it gives me satisfaction. People are gradually showing interest in my music.”
Born and raised in Kathmandu, she lived in London for a few years. Currently, she is based in Austin, Texas, the USA. She worked as a user experience consultant in an IT firm in Texas but now is a freelancer. Living abroad has had a significant effect on her songwriting. Even in a hectic daily routine, she still manages to produce her music.
“The calmness in my music comes from solitude and loneliness I felt when living abroad. I create my own world in my music.”
To write songs, she gets inspired by what she observes.”I cannot write songs until I feel like it,” she says. “I usually write spontaneously when I feel emotionally affected by the things I hear or see.”
The evolvement of Nepali independent music
She is amazed by how talented independent musicians are on the rise in the Nepali music industry.
“In my earlier musical journey, I looked for validation from the mainstream music industry to set an identity. But now, with a good network of indie musicians, we are exploring how to negotiate for identity in a collective manner. ”

When asked who her favourite artists are, she listed out many. “I am fond of many artists, like Baaja, Diwas Gurung (based in the US), Didi Bahini, Gaule Bhai (based in Bangalore), Shreya Rai, Bartika Rai, Kathmandu Killers, On Acid and many others. The independent scene is growing and in all genres.”
Currently, a tour has been planned and she is working with Mannu Shahi of Didi Bahini and Birat Basnet (previously of Night Band) for the tour. The tour includes a wide variety of venues around Kathmandu, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Sikkim.
“With them, I can learn more about Nepali folk music as they have studied ethnomusicology and are also very technical as well as organic.”
Overcoming the problems galore
While she likes the music being produced in Nepal and how the music industry is booming lately, she feels many artists are exploited by businesspersons who own mainstream studios.
“It is sad that the mainstream music industry exploits artists. Indie musicians are working from the grassroots to change the scenario. Artists must lead the movement.”
Meanwhile, she also tells of harrowing tales of sexism in the music industry, globally.
“It is deeply rooted, not only in Nepal but worldwide. Esperanza Spalding, an American jazz musician, said recently about the sexist encounters she faced. So it is hard to tackle that for women musicians. When a girl starts playing her instrument, people assume that they are not going to be good. We do not want to be treated differently, but we want people to understand our music, and think of us as capable.”
Similarly, heckling has been a constant issue for many musicians. Being a female artist, dealing with hecklers is harder.

“One needs to be tough to deal with hecklers. In my early days, I faced many hecklers. And many of them were sexist. Some of the comments would be very disturbing like ‘you are a pretty good musician for a woman.’ Such was always irritating.”
However, she has gradually learned to claim that the stage and time are hers now. She feels inspired by Nepali female musicians in the indie scene and relieved as more women musicians are coming out. The music has evolved than before.
“Earlier, men had the freedom to take part in concerts, while we had to rely just on the internet to listen to music. But we developed our own taste in music now.”
For example, she shares her experience of collaborating with Didi Bahini during the Yomari Sessions. “Collaboration with Didi Bahini was very fun. Every band members were very talented in their own instruments and they gave their own inputs to my songs. And it gave me more freedom when collaborating with the groups of girls.”",/lifestyle,"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 04:00:53 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/aama-movie-review-moving-plot-fails-to-quench-nepali-film-industrys-thirst-for-newness.html,"
Let’s begin it straightaway: Aama is a moving story acted out by proven artists. The movie tells a typical tale of the Nepali society. The plot is focused, restricted by the principles of necessity and probability. It must be a good watch for lovers of realism.
But ironically, this specificity becomes problematic if you go to the cinema after watching the trailer—the nearly two-hour-long movie offers you nothing more than what you have seen in the four-minute advertisement. The development of climax and denouement seems formulaic; it is predictable and rarely surprises you.
Overall, hence, Aama is another average project. While it offers you a spellbinding story with an excellent directorship, the movie cannot quench the Nepali cinema industry’s long-awaited thirst for originality and ‘newness’.
 ‘Single-handed’ movie 
Because it is a family story and family values play decisive roles in anyone’s life in the Nepali society, the movie easily appeals to the Nepali audience in general. Dipendra K Khanal has written an emotionally charged story incorporating three subplots that are closely interconnected. The three subplots deal with different issues of the Nepali society: from the growing exodus of the young population to the foreign land, leaving the life of old people miserable in the villages, to the woes of ‘infertile’ couples. Yet, they connect to one theme: the parent-child relationship.

Khanal seems so cautious not to ruin the vigour of his story that he has not only directed the movie, but he has held the cinematographer’s job also with himself. Apparently, his single-handedness has paid off. The camerawork is almost flawless. Many things, for example, the couple (Surakshya Panta and Manish Niraula)’s desire for a child, are told with the use of images, without saying it in words. Separate shots and scenes have been connected well. Transitions are effectively marked. For the sake of clarity, flashback scenes have not been used.
Despite having three subplots, which could have been developed into separate standalone stories, the movie communicates well. Khanal, as the writer and the director, deserves applause for this.
Realistic acting and presentation
More importantly, the characters are built well in the movie. Though the title character is apparently played by veteran Mithila Sharma, Panta is the lead in this movie. Panta has done an excellent job; she looks natural in her emotionally-turbulent role. This project has elevated her one step up in her career. Sharma’s acting is also impressive, but the character she acts is quite flat that she is not required to show any dynamism and versatility. The same condition applies to the role played by Sarita Giri. The story allows both Sharma and Giri to smile very rarely. Though in a negative role, veteran radio drama actor Laxmi Bhusal has done her job well.
Because Khanal has introduced comparatively a few characters in the story, he has not lost his control over their portrayal. As Nepali movie critics often say, some ‘star’ actors work on their own frequently depriving the director of his/her command over the movie. However, Khanal has successfully handled the issue. Even the minor characters, such as the roles played by Aashant Sharma, Saroj Aryal and Asmita Khanal are built well.

But there are some glitches. Consider two scenes as examples. When Aarati (Panta) shouts at some doctors at the first hospital the family visits to admit her dad (Desh Bhakta Khanal), the audience feels it is too early to make Panta angry. Perhaps, the director could have delayed the expression of anger. Then, in the second half, Aarati’s unnamed mother (Mithila Sharma) speaks to the ailing husband (Khanal) without waiting for his response, and her speech about how the couple raised their children in the past lasts for more than one minute. Here, the director has forgotten that his job is to show, not tell.
It seems the director deliberately wants to keep all men of the film under the women’s shadow. Not only that Khanal has been silenced, the character of Aarati’s husband, played by Manish Niraula, is also underdeveloped in the movie. His angry shouts at the wife seem made-up. While he is also a major character of the story and the way he acts out significantly affects the overall performance of the movie, Niraula’s training is below par in comparison to the performance of Surakshya Panta or Mithila Sharma.
Predictable story
Perhaps the bigger problem than the training of the actors is the story’s predictability. While the four-minute trial sums up everything that happens in the movie, a few elements of the film also enable the viewers to guess what they are expecting next. Consider, for example, the use of rainfall as a motif. Stereotypically, rainfall suggests some imminent challenges to the protagonists. As the curtains open, an ambulance is plying a serpentine road while it is raining cats and dogs. Showing the rainfall once or twice could have made the movie interesting and symbolically rich, but the audience of Aama fails to count how many times it rains after the opening scene.

So happens with Aarati’s mother’s efforts to check the time on her husband’s watch. However, the use of roasted corn as a symbol is appropriate; it tells a lot about the family’s shattered dreams.
Of course, there are a few things that the trailer does not show you clearly; for example, a Christian man’s efforts to convert people at the hospital and the hospital’s fraudulent activities. However, they do not add anything significant to the plot.
Khanal’s 2016 blockbuster Pashupati Prasad fared well in the box office because its story was unique and particular. The movie had dealt with the incidents that general people had rarely thought about. However, his latest project does not have such unique elements, except that a lady shaves her head for her parents’ funeral. That too has turned stale with its excessive exposure on the film’s posters.

Verdict
Perhaps, Khanal is aware of these shortcomings; hence he has been using the name and fame of Pashupati Prasad to promote Aama. When he delivers his next project after a few years, Khanal will still need to use the Pashupati Prasad-fame to advertise that. Though emotionally appealing, Aama does not offer him anything sellable to him and anything ‘new’ to the audience.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hundreds-of-nepali-families-lose-their-kids-to-cancer-because-they-cant-afford-available-treatment.html,"In bed no. 329 at the oncology ward of Kanti Children’s Hospital in Kathmandu, a child is lying on her back, with her mom lost in her thoughts next to the child’s worried grandmom.
Dr Bishnurath Giri enters the room and the grandmother gets ups. She instantly asks, “What will happen to my granddaughter now?” He asks her back, “Did you discuss it in the family?”
The equally worried mother replies, “We will treat her even if we have to sell our property, but what are her chances?”
“She has a very complex kind of blood cancer. We have records of treating 1 among the 40-45 such patients,” says the doctor speaks ambiguous words, “She is only eight months old so the risk is there, but with treatment and the right nutrition, she will get better.”
Not quite satisfied, the mother says softly, “…so it’s up to God…”
***
In the next bed is Sarita Sah from Mahottari. She is here for her daughter’s treatment. Nine months ago, her 10-year-old daughter had a fever. She would vomit as soon as she eats and complained of severe pain in her hands and legs. She went to many local hospitals but to no avail. Finally, she has come to Kanti. Recently, it has been confirmed that she has cancer.
In these nine months, she has spent more than Rs 400,000 for treatment. When she was informed that the treatment would continue for another three years, she was perplexed. She is staying at a hotel in Gaushala while her husband is abroad for employment, “We have sold all of our land; the money he [the husband] sends is not enough. There is so a huge loan to reply,” she laments.
And, in yet another next bed is Rambabu Yadav, also from Mahottari for his son’s treatment. His son has blood cancer and has been in the hospital for three years. He has a loan of Rs 800,000 and has spent a million rupees he got from selling land, in treatment only. He has an additional monthly expense of Rs 8,000 for a room where he is residing with his wife. It is said that it will take two more years for the treatment to finish.
“I was working abroad and came back to Nepal when he got sick. What I had earned is all gone, so is our land. The loan is adding on, whereas the treatment has not finished,” he says, “I feel like leaving the treatment at once.”
There are a lot of people in the ward who share the same story. From the burden of treatment cost to a lack of rooms near the hospital area, the families face the problems galore. Sah says, “The hotel is expensive, and I’ve been searching for a room for the past six months.”
***
About a month ago, Bagmati Sahani from Chandranigahapur of Rautahat district reached Kanti Hospital with her daughter. The daughter was diagnosed with blood cancer. Oncologist Dr Giri sent her to the Shukraaraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (Teku Hospital) for a bone-marrow biopsy. However, the mother never returned. They later found out that she did not even have a Rs 1,000 to do the biopsy.
She could not afford to live in Kathmandu for a year. Naturally, her status did not support her plea to get a loan either. In the end, she compromised heavily and ditched the idea of treatment of her daughter.
Sahani is only a case in point here. There is a pool of people sharing similar stories, who after the disease is diagnosed, choose to not get treatment because they do not have money. Dr Giri says one of the 10 cases he deals with gets untreated.
***
According to the World Health Organisation, as many as 300,000 children are diagnosed with cancer every year. The statistics say that the number of children dying of cancer is high in developing countries like Nepal, almost quadruple the number of such deaths in developed countries. Most of the victims belong to lower and medium-class families.
In Kanti Hospital only, there are 200 new cancer patients annually whereas 500 come for follow-ups.  BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital of Bharatpur in Chitwan treats 100 children every year.
Of such patients in the Bharatpur hospital, 60 per cent have blood cancer, says Pediatric Oncology Unit’s head Dr Niva Tiwari. In Kanti also, the ratio of blood cancer to other types is 60:40, says Dr Giri. Among 12 hospitals that treat cancer in children, 525 children were admitted in 2015. Of them, 205 were fighting against blood cancer.
That year, there were only 14 children at oncology ward of Kanti Hospital. The number reached 171 in 2019. In Bharatpur, the number reached 104 in 2016 from 50 in 1999.
Based on the records of countries with proper cancer statistics, it is assumed that around 120 in every one million children below 19 suffer from cancer. However, no such research has been done in Nepal. The doctors estimate that around 1,500 children with cancer reach hospitals in Nepal, but the actual number is just half. It suggests the other half cannot afford to visit a hospital. Dr Giri hints at the possibility that only 20 per cent of children with cancer have reached the hospitals.
***
Dr Giri says the number of children with cancer admitting to the hospitals has risen up because of the growing awareness in people about the disease. But, the hospital has not been able to give the proper services to them given the lack of equipment, agrees with the doctor. Though the number of patients has increased, investments in both Kanti and Bharatpur hospitals have not. All services they are providing are based on limited equipment, medicines, beds, specialised doctors, and nurses.
The Bharatpur hospital’s director Dr Bijay Chandra Acharya claims that around 95 per cent of cancer seen in children can be detected in the hospital. Even with limited resources, he says, the hospital still gives quality services, “But the problem is that people cannot afford treatment.”
Dr Giri also claims Kanti is giving quality services despite not having enough resources.
***
Among the 750 children who reach Kanti for diagnosis, only 250 complete the treatment procedures. Doctors say if the children get full and consistent treatment, their life can be saved.
About 100 children are diagnosed with cancer at BP Cancer Hospital annually. But, 60 per cent of them do not follow the treatment procedure and only 30 per cent of them get complete treatment. In Kanti, 200 children are diagnosed, but 10 per cent of them do not show up again while 10 per cent of them leave the treatment halfway.
Generally, the treatment for cancer is expensive than one of any other diseases. The patients have to go to the hospital for at least five years. The course also involves expensive oral medicine that continues for years. This is why the lower class people cannot afford the treatment.
In Kanti and Bharatpur, services like blood tests, urine tests, x-ray, CT (computerised tomography) scan, and bed charges are free for cancer patients. For children below 15, the hospital also provides food. Likewise, the government also offers a discount of up to Rs 100,000 on medicines at the hospital pharmacy. Dr Tiwari in Bharatpur Hospital says, “The Rs 100,000 sum from the government is enough to cover the chemotherapy for the child.”
But even with such incentives from the government, a middle-income family cannot afford the expenses of treatment. Many of the medicines still need to be purchased from outside while for some tests, they even have to go as far as to India. Those from outside Kathmandu have to come to the capital, prepared to rent a room. These factors play to force the families to give up the treatment course and the hope for the lives of their children.
Dr Giri says, for the treatment at Kanti alone, one needs Rs 400,000-500,000. In a private hospital, it costs Rs 1.5 to 2.5 million. With the cost of a cancer treatment done in private hospitals, six children can get treatment in Kanti.
***
The family’s failure to afford the treatment is not the only problem. It is neither easy to diagnose cancer. Even Kanti Hospital does not have a functional MRI machine; the hospitals outside Kathmandu even do not have CT scanners. No Nepali hospital has a machine required to detect 40 types of blood cancer cells.
Because the right diagnosis is not possible, children with a brain tumour are more likely to lose their lives early, says Director of the Hospital Prof Dr Rishikesh Narayan Shrestha. It is the second common diagnosed disease in children. Based on different studies, it is assumed that 20 to 25 per cent of the children with cancer who reach hospitals are diagnosed with a brain tumour. However, in the cancer registry of 12 hospitals in Nepal, it is only eight per cent.
Even today, the blood samples are sent to India for an examination which costs about Rs 25,000 to 50,000. It costs the same if one has to detect blood cancer. If the test equipment had been available in Nepal it would have cost around Rs 5,000 only, says Dr Giri.
According to the doctors, a flow cytometre can be bought for Rs 50,000 to Rs 70,000, but an MRI scanner costs as much as Rs 100 million.
Dr Giri says the MRI scanner is necessary but there is no need to get the flow cytometre in Kanti right away. He says Bir Hospital or Teku Hospital can get the flow cytometre. “It is not necessary to have all equipment in all hospitals, but if the government invests Rs 50 million to get the equipment in Teku Hospital, we will no longer need to send the samples to India for tests.”
***
According to the WHO, the success rate of cancer treatment has not increased because people are visiting the hospital too late, possibly because they think they cannot afford the treatment. The survival rate in developed countries is 80 per cent whereas it is just 37 per cent in the underdeveloped countries.
Nepal’s survival rate is 50 to 60 per cent while it is 20 per cent in Africa, says oncologist Sudhir Sapkota. He says, “To increase the survival rate, we need to increase awareness among the people. If we can just reach out to the children who are out of reach now, we can save a lot more lives.”
The WHO has pledged to save one million lives from cancer by 2030. It means the number of cancer survivors has to double. “For this, we have to up the quality of services that we have now in terms of cancer diagnosis and treatment,” says Dr Sapkota.
Then, the number of paediatric oncologists in Nepal has to go up.  The Ministry for Health and Population has not allocated any separate quota for a paediatric oncologist in the hospitals. Nevertheless, there are two paediatric oncologists, a resident doctor and nine nurses in Kathmandu.
According to the standards set for the underdeveloped countries, there should be 25 cancer-specific nurses and six doctors along with medical officers in one hospital.
Most of the previous government policies prioritised only communicable diseases, which is why cancer diagnosis and treatment have not been a priority, says the ministry’s spokesperson Mahendra Shrestha. “The new provincial governments are working on policies for the quota for the paediatrician(s) and oncologist(s) in provincial-level hospitals,” Shrestha assures.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/he-wished-she-had-not-been-born-but-she-saved-his-life-literally.html,"Hira Kaji Maharjan (right) and his daughter Sarita
On the Father’s Day three years ago, Sarita Maharjan brought a cake and put it in front of her dad Hira Kaji. Written on the cake was ‘New Life’. Everyone shouted, “Happy Birthday to you, daddy”.
This was Sarita’s attempt to bring back the ‘lost’ happiness to her father’s life.
The next year, on Father’s Day again, she did the same. This time, the “Second Year” was written on the cake.
Sarita and her sister Sarila did not order any cake to celebrate the Father’s Day last year–for they were mourning the death of their mother, Manju. (Most Nepalis celebrate Father’s Day on the full moon day of Bhadra, in August-September, every year.)
Though there was no cake this year, Sarita was still taking care of her father.
Two years ago, if Sarita had not given her father her liver, perhaps he would not have been living with her today.
—
Today, Sarita stays with her sister and father at Lagantol, Kathmandu.
She has two elder sisters, both married. According to Hira Kaji, Sarita and Sarila were born while the parents were wishing for a son. However, now he is proud of his two daughters, “What they have done for me is something that no son would do. They are my sons.”
In the third year since his liver transplant now, Hira Kaji is living a healthy life. In trimmed, salt-and-pepper hairs and shaved beards, he looks younger than his age.
He runs a momo shop at his house’s ground floor; the shop is extended to the yard where he has kept a table. This is the same place where he was born 62 years ago and brought up.
—

Born in a Newari family, alcohol was not a taboo for Hira Kaji from a young age. He tested alcohol for the first time before he was one year old. Nevertheless, he claims that he did not like its taste in his youth and got addicted to it after opening a Newari khaja ghar (snacks shop). He says, “After a whole day of work, you get tired, body aches; you drink and then sleep.”
Everything was good until six years ago when his wife Manju had a heart attack. Fortunately, she was taken to the hospital on time and received the treatment right away. She was in a ventilator for 11 days. However, there was not much progress; she got even sicker, and her kidney failed.
The wife’s health had a direct impact on Hira Kaji’s wellbeing. He found himself tenser; he though more alcohol would make him relieved.
Manju had to get dialysis twice a week, for which Sarita managed everything. Owing to her care, the mother gradually recovered, and Hira Kaji too found himself calm.
But, his bad luck had not ended, it seems. The family’s residential house cracked in the 2015 earthquake and it left the family helpless. Hira Kaji, as in the past, again thought that alcohol would help him get relaxed. He began to drink more liquors than the amount of food he used to eat every day.
Sarita vividly remembers those times. She says her dad was taken ill after a few days. “We took him to the Teaching Hospital. The doctors said his liver was damaged, and it would take millions of rupees to treat it abroad.”
The treatment was beyond what the family could afford, and the doctors gave an alternative to take medicines and lower the risks. She told the doctor, “We cannot afford the operation, but we will certainly lower the alcohol consumption.”
On the other hand, Manju was getting sicker, and now going for dialysis thrice a week. She was not able to tolerate the pain, she would scream, “I cannot…Better give me poison.”
Sarita was running a boutique then, but her income started falling down to cover the medical bills of her parents. Hira Kaji stopped running the business after having to go to the hospital regularly. Then Sarita started working in the mornings. “One month, daddy would be sick; mummy the next month. I was managing somehow,” Sarita says, “But then both mom and dad got sick. Even my sister got sick.

Then Sarita felt that she could not handle the situation anymore. She was questioning why the god gave her such hardship. But she got support from her friends. “You have done it for years, do not stop now,” they said.
Nonetheless, some people would tell Hira Kaji and Manju, “See what happens when you do not have a son.” That made them even more unsettled. Their first child was a son, but he died as an infant.
—
Sarita was busy with her boutique. Her mom called and said, “Come fast, your father is in pain.” Sarita reached home as soon as she could. Hira Kaji was sub-conscious; first, she thought it was because of alcohol. “Dad, dad…,” she called out, but Hira Kaji did not respond and she got worried.
The sisters brought Hira Kaji three stories down and took him to a hospital in Pulchok. He was kept on a ventilator, and after the checkup, “It is difficult to save your father; his liver is damaged completely. The only option is a liver transplant and it will cost two million rupees.”
Now, what to do? She had never imagined her life without her father, she was very scared. She started watching videos about liver transplant and decided, “My blood group matches with him. I will give him my liver and save him.”
Before talking to her father though, she consulted the doctor for the transplant. And, she told her father, finally. Hira Kaji said, “I was about to die anyway. My daughter wanted to save me anyhow. I could do nothing but agree.”
But her mother did not agree, “You have to marry and go to somebody else’s house, why would you be giving liver?” The mother’s brothers were also not supportive. “Nobody supported, but my friends were there to support.”
She started seeing the glimmer of hope on her father’s face after he got the new lease of life. Her intention to save her father got stronger.
After two months, the operation was done. On July 6, 2017, at the Human Organ Transplant Centre, Bhaktapur, Hira Kaji got transplanted 45 per cent of Sarita’s liver into his body.
—
After the operation, Sarita had constant pain; she used to cry out in pain. Her sister used to cry watching her suffer. She suffered all, as she had already decided to save her father. Sarita today shares it with happiness, “After gaining consciousness, on my wheelchairs, I first went to see dad. He was still unconscious then.”
On the fourth day of operation, the doctor asked Sarita, “You want to meet dad?” She nodded in utmost happiness. “When we saw him first, he was walking, holding the urine bag, and said ‘See, I am all better’.”
Watching her father energetic, Sarita could not stop her happy tears. She wiped her tears secretly. She now says, “Watching him up and walking, I also wanted to do it. But it took me just 10 days to begin to move on my feet.”
—
After the operation, they rented rooms in Bhaktapur and Kirtipur–he still had troubles going up and down the narrow stairs of their house. After a few weeks, he got better and went back home.
The required amount of medicines and frequency of follow-ups for Hira Kaji gradually decreased. He resumed his momo business.

Manju also started seeing the hope of getting better after the operation. Sarita had also started preparing for the mother’s kidney transplant. She found a donor too, and all the paperwork was done. Manju was also admitted to a hospital. The operation was scheduled two months away. But, only after a week in the hospital, Manju breathed her last.
Then, Hira Kaji shut down his shop again. But, he has not lost hope for life. “I am slowly handling myself. Those who died are gone, but my daughter saved me and I will live for them now.”
Recently, he resumed the business. The income is just enough to cover half of the family expenses now. Sarita has also reopened her boutique to cover the other half.
Nowadays, people, who used to sneer at him for not having a son, have disappeared, into the unknown. Instead, other people come to meet him to offer their support.",/lifestyle,"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 06:06:53 +0000"

Kathmandu, February 28
Second-rung leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Parrty have devised a solution to the recent conflict between the party chairman, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, and other secretariat members. They say nominating the party’s vice-chairman Bamdev Gautam for a vacant seat in the National Assembly as decided by the party secretariat but letting incumbent Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada continue working as the minister for the next six months is a win-win solution for all.
As Khatiwada’s term as the Upper House member is expiring next week, the party had told the government to replace him with Gautam as the member to be nominated by the government. However, Oli had told the leaders that Khatiwada was being removed in cahoots with a few industrialists of the country, hence he would reappoint Khatiwada to counter them.
Amidst the crisis, leaders including the party’s general secretary Bishnu Paudel told Oli that Khatiwada could still work as the minister for the next six months even if the government nominated Gautam for the Upper House. The constitution has it that the prime minister can appoint anyone outside the Federal Parliament a minister, but the appointee should be made a member in the next six months.
It means if Oli reappoints Khatiwada the next day he loses the lawmaker’s position, he can be a legitimate minister for the next six months and the party can think of any option to take him to Parliament later.

The ruling Nepal Communist Party’s executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said another chairperson of the party, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, must abide by a decision made by the party secretariat about nominating the party’s vice-chairman Bamdev Gautam for the National Assembly membership.
Dahal’s statement comes at a time when the conflict between Oli and other members of the secretariat has reached its peak over the nomination. Whereas other members unanimously want the Oli-led government to nominate Gautam for the position so that the power-hungry vice-chairman feels satisfied, Oli has sensed the efforts as an attempt to remove Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada from his position. Khatiwada’s Upper House membership is expiring next week and the government has to nominate one person to the president to appoint as his successor.
Arguing that some industrialists were fuelling the efforts to remove Khatiwada, Oli says he will nominate Khatiwada again in the Upper House instead.

I had seen some snowy peaks from far away, but such moments had never satisfied me.
This February, however, I got a chance—to cross a snow-covered stretch of around 23 kilometres in Manang, a dream destination for all snow lovers.
I used to think that Manang is a far cry from the plains where I was born and raised in. I only had heard about the hardship that people experience while travelling in the district beyond the mountains. But my experience this time was a different story. The beauty that this place offers compensates the ordeals that you need to go through.
As we left Kathmandu in the morning, we reached the district headquarters Chame in the evening. Then we trekked to Humde, our final destination, on the second day. Sporadic snowfall forced us to halt our walk frequently.
We were travelling to participate in the second edition of Humde Ice Climbing Festival. Ice climbing was a major attraction for the tourists visiting Humde village in Ngisyang rural municipality-4 of the district. Around 40 persons, including Nepalis and foreigners, were participating in the event.
My first ice climbing experience was fun. At first, the steep hill scared me. As an ice climber, I was supposed to climb up 350 metres, steep uphill, and the entire route was covered in snow. However, I stepped forward, my confidence level also began to go up. A 160-metre uphill walk that I had done just before helped me acclimatise.
In the end, the trip proved to be one of the most memorable journeys that I had ever done in my life. The foreigners accompanying me commented that the place exactly looked like Switzerland. However, I was sad to notice that the government has failed to take benefits from such a mesmerising place.

Simikot is the gateway to Kailash. This district headquarter of Humla is mainly accessed by air. After a half hour flight from Nepalgunj, you will reach Simikot from which the Kailash region is three days hike away.
 
3.
Those not keen on religion can take a detour to Limi valley. A six day trek will take you to this region where local, through routine life, put up a fascinating display of culture.
 
4.
Other routes to the region will take to you Lapcha Syar via Hilsa or alternately via Nyalo Pass (4950m). Be liberal with your time; this trek will take almost three weeks to complete.
 
5.
For those on the trail to Kailash, it is worth noting that the trek will take to the other side of the border to Tibet. The unpredictability on the side of the Chinese authorities, in granting visas to tourists on their part, could make the trip unsuccessful. If that is the case, visitors can go to Lapcha Syar in Humla to see Kailash from the Nepal side.

“Adventure never ends. There is a lot of adventures out there, waiting for us to live them!”
 In Kyanjin Gompa village, a cluster of what looked like more than 30 blue-roofed houses—some as tall as four-storied, standing almost nose to nose in the sweeping valley, was not something the group had looked forward.   “Man, the place looks booming, it’s more like a town than a village,” said Diwash aloud.
And to round off the amazing sight, Mount Langtang Lirung, in all its grandeur, peered over the valley from the northern horizon while a row of snow-capped peaks rose and fell in a ripple from right to left. After checking into a guesthouse, the group strangely looked anything but tired. Maybe, it’d to do with their having made it to their destination without any hiccups.
Bird’s eye view of Kyanjin Gompa village
Curiously, there seemed no fuss and bother about finding a hotel although they arrived late in the afternoon. They checked into a modest-looking Hotel Tibet on a street called Padma Marga with decent rooms and fair enough price, nothing to grumble about. 
Celebration time
The dining room of the hotel wore a festive ambiance that evening. And what better way could there be for them to rejoice the moment than guzzle a bottle of beer and let off a hearty belch. The group restricted themselves to just a glass or two, though, because a bottle of beer up there was three times the price of Kathmandu.
Shishir went for a mug of sea buckthorn (tora in Tibetan and dale chuk in Nepali), instead, which cost him Rs 200.00. Sea buckthorn is a native wild bush that distributes in arid highlands of Nepal and produces orange-red berries that are said to have medicinal properties including cancer-fighting agents. I recall seeing those wild thorny shrubs during my cycling ride to Upper Mustang (chichi in Thakali dialect in Mustang and tora in Upper Mustang). Curiously, every single hotel in the Khumbu region (also Everest Region) has sea buckthorn juice on its menu.
The riders were not the only ones in the dining room, schmoozing about their victory. Small groups of foreign trekkers huddled together, talking animatedly. It seemed the crowds in the hall were revelling in their triumph as if they had won a soccer match.
Kyanjing Gompa village at night
Relaxed, everyone wished, they spent at least two days, hanging around Kyanjin village, but they were running short of time as they had to get back to Kathmandu in three days.  Khashing told the team that they had just one day to spare.
“I think we should go to Kyanjin Ri Viewpoint, the best-bit or the icing on the cake for every trekker to Lantang Valley trek. It is situated at 4,773 m, northeast of Kyanjin Gompa, the highest elevation we’ll have done this far. What Kala Patthar is to Everest Base Camp, Kyanjin Ri is to the Langtang trek, the highest point the trekkers attempt,” Khashing proposed. “Yippee,” bellowed Diwash.
The trail was not rideable. And none fancied the idea of lugging the bike again for hours, as they had had enough of it. Anyways, they recalled those admonitory words of the military officer and decided to hike instead.
Bird’s eye view of Kyanjin Gompa Village from the Kyanjin Ri heights
To Kyanjin Ri 
The team started early after a hasty breakfast, as it would take almost four hours to the viewpoint, something like 1,000 m straight up from Kyanjin Gompa village. The group later admitted that it was worth spending one day on the round-hike to Kyanjin Ri as the high point afforded a mind-boggling view of soaring cliffs, sharp pinnacles, and by far the massive Langtang Range in a panoramic sweep with glaciers into the bargain.
As they climbed up the narrow trail for two hours something, it looked they had made it to the summit, which was marked by fluttering prayer flags. As it turned, they still had to do twice that distance to reach the top. It took them almost three and a half hours from Kyanjin village to crest the ridge.
Strangely, the rock-strewn cliff tapered sharply to look like a needle-point from a distance. The wind was pretty strong at the peak and nippy, too. Contrary to their expectation, the viewpoint was not isolated. Several foreign trekkers seemed busy enjoying the scenery around and clicking on their cameras hungrily. After a customary hi-hello and Namaste, the group also joined the bandwagon.
Kyanjin Ri Viewpoint 
Everyone looked ecstatic once on the crest, and it seemed there was no time for small talk. Wide-eyed, the group ran their eyes around in a frenzy, some busy taking pictures, others selfies with their cell-phones, vying for the perfect shot. From the northwest, the entire face of Langtang Lirung seemed to gaze back at them. And at its base rested the awesome Langtang Lirung Glacier, with the lateral moraines covered by thick debris.
Awestruck, Diwas goggles at the Langtang Range.
At a closer look, the glaciers seemed to separate the lofty peaks, the likes of the Changbu Himal (6,251 m), Yuba (6,264 m), and to the northeast, the Yalla Peak (5,500 m).To the southwest, Tsergo Ri Peak stood conspicuous. The Tsergo Ri also offers another challenging climb for the trekkers. The South, across the valley, commanded the view of Naya Kanga (5,844 m).

 The Langtang Range of mountains includes other prominent peaks such as Dorje Lakpa (6,966 m), Yubra Himal (6,035 m), Loenpo Gang (6,979 m), Kyunga Ri (6,601 m), Dogpache (6,562 m), Shelbachum (6,707), Langshisha Ri (6,427m), Ganchempo (6,387 m), and Jugal Himal (6,151 m), among many others. If you are hung up on viewing the Himalayan Range with a minimum of time spent on traveling, Langtang should go into your bucket list as it is the closest to Kathmandu Valley.
Shishir tried to locate the Ganjala Pass but failed. He had called off his plan to trek to Ganjala Pass, almost three days from Kyanjin Gompa. The reason was simple; he was not adequately outfitted and lacked the essentials needed for the trek.
He regretted having taken the matter lightly when he first planned the trek to the pass. The rest of the group could easily see his crestfallen face. “Don’t worry, Shishir. There is always a next time,” consoled Diwash, but that did not seem to amuse him. Little surprise, though, if you hear about Shishir, trail-blazing it, solo, to the Ganjala Pass, nay beyond, no sooner the trip was over.
End of journey
The group made a hasty retreat back to Kyanjin Gompa to make it before dark. Nobody fancied stumbling in the dark on that treacherous path.  Everyone looked worn-down and sad that they had to leave, the very next day. “Ke garne,” (what to do), as they say it in Nepali.
The gang. Sitting L to R: Shishir, Anamica and Rojisha; standing L to R: Khashing and Diwash. Mt. Langtang Lirung serves as the backdrop.

 Fond memories
All good things must come to an end, as they say. For the team, only haunting memories lingered to take back home. But, everyone enjoyed it hands down, hardships aside. It seemed the group not only enjoyed the ride braving the challenging terrain but felt blessed with happy and hilarious times, too. Let’s share those priceless moments the group enjoyed.
On their way back to Lama Hotel, a local guy watched Anamica and Rojisha walking their bikes down on the stone stairs (he’d missed out on Khashing and Diwash riding down the steps). He sounded contemptuous and sneering when he addressed the group, “Is that how you came back from Kyanjin Gompa, walking and pushing your bikes?” Outraged, Khashing and Diwash pushed their bikes up the stairs (some 200 of them) and came hurtling down, riding. That demo, eventually, made the local bloke’s trap shut.
At the Langtang village’s relocated site, Khashing and Diwash suddenly stopped their bikes as they heard a yelling from Anamica followed by hooting and high-pitched wolf-whistling. As it turned out, she was startled by a mule that suddenly seemed to appear from nowhere on the track before her.
The local blokes were, in fact, not directing their jeering at her, but trying to shoo the ‘beast of burden’ away. It made Khashing and Diwash slap their sides and double over with laughter. But seeing Anamica and Rojisha on bicycles, on the entire trail, did make the locals stop in their track open-mouthed, surprised, and amused.
Diwash tackles a steep gradient. Shishir brings up the rear and the locals watch amused.
At Mundu, tired of eating dal-bhat, Anamica craved for something to tickle her tastebuds. When they stopped for tea, she suddenly saw WaiWai noodles on display in the shop. Her mouth watered, as she recalled, her days at school when she used to devour an entire packet dry, by crushing it and spicing it with the condiments that came with the noodles.
Anamica asked the small girl at the teashop about the price. Rupees fifty, she said. She asked for a packet, and without a second thought, tore it open. Scarcely had she crumpled up the packet than the girl who’d gone to confirm the price with her mom busy washing clothes came running back, and said, it was Rs 200.00 and not Rs 50.00.
Rojisha, too, gathered some fond memories to cherish back home. In Khangshyap, she was approached by a young boy who asked her to let him ride her bike. The 13-year-old boy seemed to ride well, although the bike was way too big for him.  His excitement was something to watch as his ruddy face flushed a flaming red. She just adored those blessed moments.
On their way back to Shyaphru Besi, Rojisha had another exciting time. While pedalling across a wooded stretch, she had to stop as a pair of barking deer stood smack-dab in the middle of the track, some 10 yards away. The beautiful animals with their shiny tan-coat looked at her, and did not spook, just casually crossed the track, and entered the nearby brush.
Lo and behold, moments later, as Diwash arrived from behind, they reappeared, looked at them for a few seconds, and then sauntered back into the woods. “I’d never seen deer in the wild before. It was not like seeing them in the zoo with their dusty coat and frail sickly look. They, on the contrary, looked so full of life,” Rojisha sounded very excited when she said that.
Another remarkable thing about the trip was that Shishir made sure they did not litter the place, every time they stopped. It looked that bordered a little on obsession as he picked up the filth like tobacco wrappers, plastic bags, and the like thrown around by others.
On their way back, the gang stopped to rest and sip water from their bottles by the track, a little further from Sherpa Gaun.  Rojisha was sitting on the left while the rest were sprawled out on the right. Suddenly, Rojisha rummaged out three packets of biscuits from her backpack and, to her bemused buddies, started gorging on them. It appeared she was not eating but stuffing herself. Before long, she had two packets devoured. She handed over the only packet left to her befuddled buddies.
“When we stopped to rest, I happened to look ahead and saw the steep hill in the distance, which made me so overwhelmed that I suddenly felt faint from hunger. Blocked-off from the view of the steep hill from their side, the rest of my partners were watching me curiously,” Rojisha burst into a peal of laughter as she shared the funny incident with me.
No sooner the group rose to their feet and prepared to hit the trail than they knew why Rojisha had acted that way. The group poked fun at her the rest of the way to Shyaphru Besi. And the journey ended, on that feeling-good upbeat note.
The skipper
Khashing, the skipper, seemed happy to answer my question when I asked him about the trip. “It was one of my toughest rides ever since we did a track that was meant exclusively for trekking.  I was weighed down not only by a hefty backpack (almost 11 kg) but the primary responsibility of the ladies too, rested heavy on my mind,” admitted Khashing to me.
The team leader then went on to relate one funnier incident. “On our way back from Kyanjin Ri, Diwash asked me to pose for a shot and took the camera. I chose a huge boulder and stood on it for the shot. Rojisha joined me and sat on her haunches next to me. She folded her legs and stretched her arms out into a meditative ‘janana mudra.’
“I don’t know what got into me that I leaped into the air in a flash, and in mid-air folded my legs and then my hands into a Namaste. Luckily, I landed safely on my feet.” A group of foreign trekkers watched the stupid act, dumbstruck.
“Later,” he continued, “I realised my mistake for having done that dumb prank because right behind, the boulder fell to a sheer drop, hundreds of metres down. In hindsight, though, I think the act put a lot of spice, or ‘oomph’ into the photo, didn’t it?” he finished with a sheepish smile.
That’s for real, not trick photography. Khashing trying a hand at levitation?
For Rojisha and Anamica, it was an epic journey on wheels, but it looked that was just the beginning. “There was never a moment, I felt like giving up, or regretted going on the trip,” said Anamica, sharing her feelings with me. It appeared there was no looking back for both the ladies as they told me they would soon love to hit the trail again, no matter how tough.
“Adventure never ends. There is a lot of adventures out there, waiting for us to live them!”

Kathmandu, April 1
The Nepali Embassy in London, the capital city of the United Kingdom, will stay open every day of the week at a time when most offices in Britain are closed due to the accelerating coronavirus pandemic.
The embassy says it is opening throughout the week to hear the problems faced by the Nepalis in the UK and in Malta due to the coronavirus outbreak, and to take necessary steps. Before this, the embassy was open from Monday to Friday only.
Deputy chief of mission at the embassy, Sarad Raj Aran, says the living quarters of most of the embassy staff are in the same building within the embassy compound and they have been working beside the five days anyway.
He adds that the embassy has issued a notice informing of the extension of the office hours out of realisation that it should be more responsible during the time of the pandemic. The embassy has urged the Nepali students at various universities in Britain to stay safe and observe calm and discipline at such time and to contact the embassy in case of emergencies, stating that some of the students are facing problems including managing food, among others.

There are concerns galore about the ongoing lockdown’s impacts on the public’s daily life. Online news portals and news bulletins of radio and TV stations in Kathmandu have published and broadcast dozens of stories about cooking gas shortage and the government response to the crisis.

But, it seems only a few, if any, people are concerned about what stray animals in Kathmandu Valley eat during such hard times.

Around 26,000 dogs are said to be living on the streets of Kathmandu, according to the Federation of Animal Welfare Nepal. The number of monkeys in the valley is not known, but there are hundreds of monkeys in Pashupati and Swayambhu areas of Kathmandu. There are some cows also.

Previously, the monkeys of Pashupati and Swayambhu areas used to find hundreds of devotees throwing various foodstuffs to them every day. So were the pigeons in Bouddhanath, Basantapur Durbar Square and other places. There used to be sufficient food for the stray dogs also.

However, with the lockdown enforced, human beings are scarce on the road and around the temples since the past week. Subsequently, the monkeys, dogs, and pigeons are starving.

For many people in Nepal, animal welfare is an elitist agenda as there are thousands of people struggling ‘like animals’ for mere hand-to-mouth existence. They think the agenda just diverts the attention, as well as support, of Samaritans and other stakeholders from people to animals.

However, it is apparent that animals should also receive equal attention, support, and care because they are also parts of the society and they have human sympathies.

Realising this, a few benevolent human hearts have reached out to the animals and birds with the food. But that is apparently too little and too late.

People are more dependent on hypertexts and hypermedia. Such dependency has been more visible on children who are using their (parents’) smartphones and laptops as sources of information. However, how the children grasp knowledge and the sources of information is still a critical issue as children are more susceptible to digital addiction with explicit usage of their gadgets.
Nepal is currently on lockdown, during which children are prone to fall more into such digital addiction. So it might be necessary for parents to monitor their children’s usage of the internet. Nonetheless, parents can surely guide their children to use the internet productively. And, a few good habits they can bestow upon their children are reading books and learning reading skills on the internet.
There are multiple national and international websites that have been providing reading materials for free or at a minimum charge. A few websites which would charge the users otherwise have announced free access to their contents since the novel coronavirus outbreak haunted the world. The contents available are ebooks, multimedia, audiobooks and so on.

A project since 2008, E-Pustakalaya is an education-focused freely accessible digital library containing around 7,000 full-text documents, books, videos, audios and other forms of multimedia in various native languages as well as in English. With a user-friendly layout, the digital library is easy to browse.
Moreover, one of its webpage, EGR, is focused on the learning of primary level children through video and texts, while the other webpage, Bal Paathmala contains children’s books at three levels. Furthermore, its E-Paath platform provides digital learning materials according to the grades of the children and one can choose through multiple choices of subjects. The only drawback of E-Pustakalaya is that you cannot switch from one of the webpages mentioned above to another.
The E-Pustakalaya and E-Paath are products of Open Learning Exchange, an NGO that once adopted the government’s ambitious project One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) for its successful implementation.

Ministry of Education’s CDC Library
The contents of the Curriculum Development Centre’s library are more curriculum-focused and they provide textbooks, curricula, teachers’ guides, children’s resources and journals in multiple languages. Moreover, they contain videos of online classes of various subjects of multiple grades.
But the major problem with the website is its design. The website is not designed in a user-friendly manner as these contents need to be browsed through multiple clicks and some of the contents are unavailable to access. Nevertheless, the contents of the website are adequate and will be resourceful for children.
Kullabs
Kullabs provides notes, study materials, academic contents, videos and other multimedia items for middle school, high school, and college students. A project launched in 2012 by Kul Techno Lab and Research Centre, the website is a digital platform for both teachers and students. It provides free contents for learning online.
British Council’s Digital Library in Nepal
British Council’s Digital Library is not for children but for the Nepali nationals 18 years and above. Taking membership in the digital library provides you access to magazines or newspapers from across the globe and multimedia materials such as documentaries and full-length concerts. Moreover, various comics and graphic novels, ebooks, audiobooks and academic books, and online resources for learning English can be explored in the library. The membership for the library must be applied. Those who can become members now can enjoy the facilities free of charges until March 31, 2021.
International Children’s Digital Library (ICDL)

The ICDL’s childrenslibrary.org provides a large collection of children’s literature for free in multiple languages (unfortunately, not in Nepali though). The ICDL Foundation is a non-profit organisation, and the website launched in 2002 consists of 4,619 books in 59 languages.
Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg contains over 60,000 free ebooks, mostly older literary works published before 1924, for children as well as adults. With registrations required, every book in its catalogue is provided without cost to the readers. Thus, it is a great platform to download classic literature materials such as the works of William Shakespeare or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes.
Audible

Audible, a product of Amazon, contains audiobooks of various genres. The audiobooks, however, are not freely accessible. Nonetheless, as the schools are closed due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, it has let streaming of children’s literature in audiobooks for free through desktop, mobile and apps without any registration or fees.
Khan Academy
Khan Academy is an America-based nonprofit organisation which provides different online courses, supplementary exercises and materials for educators on a variety of subjects for free through its websites and apps. Most of the lessons it provides are in the form of short videos on YouTube. Established by an American educator Salman Khan (not to be confused with the Bollywood actor of the same name), the website features the videos that cover a range of subjects taught in schools and all grades from kindergarten to high school. Its app, Khan Academy Kids, is designed for children aged two to six in order to develop their basic skills before admission to a school.",-,"Wed, 01 Apr 2020 03:13:50 +0000"

The government of Nepal has finally called off the ambitious Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign formally citing the failure to meet the target due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Kedar Bahadur Adhikari, the secretary in the Ministry of Tourism, confirms that the Cabinet meeting held on March 22 took the decision. Earlier, the government had ‘postponed’ the campaign till April with a hope that the crisis would be over by then.
But now, instead of recovering from the crisis, the world seems much affected as the infection has already been declared a pandemic. Now, most of the countries have imposed travel restrictions on their citizens in order to protect them from the infection. Nepal itself has suspended all international flights from the past week.
The government had announced the campaigned over a year ago with a target of bringing in at least 2 million tourists in the year 2020. However, the coronavirus crisis began to plague the world from late 2019, and the global economy suffered a blow.
Secretary Adhikari says the VNY Secretariat formed in partnership with the private sector will also be dissolved in effect from April 13.
The government had allocated Rs 650 million for the campaign for this fiscal year only (which ends mid-July).
After the unexpected failure, the government is planning to launch a ‘Visit Nepal Decade’ campaign. Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai has announced that the government’s annual policy and programme for the next fiscal year will formally announce the campaign.",-,"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 09:42:38 +0000"

Nepal has expressed its concerns over the Indian government officials’ handling of the problem of Nepalis stranded in India due to the lockdown that both the countries have enforced separately to control the spread of coronavirus infection.
As the lockdown continues, hundreds of Nepalis working in India have come to the Nepal-India border areas demanding that they are allowed to enter Nepal. However, Nepali security personnel have not allowed the entry citing the border closure.
But, Nepal’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Pradeep Kumar Gyawali views that India should have been responsible to keep them safe as per the international diplomatic norms. He claims Nepal has been letting hundreds of Indian citizens stay in Nepal safely during this period.
“In the time of emergency, the concerned government should treat its citizens and foreigners equally and provide security to them. We have stated the same and done the same,” Gyawali tells Onlinekhabar in an interview, “But if we are to repatriate them, it has to be based on our mutual understanding.”
Gyawali says discussions are underway to arrange some quarantine facilities on the border to keep those stranded till the next arrangement is made. “The risk is on both sides, hence we are trying to coordinate,” he says.",-,"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 09:29:21 +0000"

Kathmandu, May 4
The Hotel Association Nepal, an organisation of Nepali hoteliers, has decided to keep all the hotels affiliated to it shut until mid-October this year owing to the impact of coronavirus crisis on the country’s tourism industry.
A meeting of the association held on Sunday also made the decision to pay their staff only 12.5 per cent of their basic salary owing to the crisis. The decision apparently violates the government decision requiring all enterprises to pay their staff a complete salary despite the lockdown and other international labour principles.
Further, the association has decided to fire the staff if they do not agree on receiving the nominal pay.
The decision is likely to hit the staff working for big and star hotels in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and other places. The association is now led by Shreejana Rana, the Executive Director of Annapurna Hotel, one of the biggest five-star hotels in the country.
Fearing that the businesses would not pay their staff, the government had decided to let the companies borrow loans from the banks at a subsidised rate. But the hoteliers made the decision to shut the hotels for a half year.",-,"Mon, 04 May 2020 04:56:03 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/online-classes-do-they-promote-learning-opportunities-or-deepen-digital-divide.html,"After the school of her two sons was closed due to the coronavirus outbreak in March, Shanti Nepal went back to her village in Kavre with her sons. Now, she is undecided whether she should come back to Kathmandu, as her sons’ school has decided to resume classes through online platforms.
Other parents in her neighbourhood were also notified by their children’s schools about online classes and some of them have returned to Kathmandu, hiding in vegetable trucks, disobeying the lockdown, and risking the Covid-19 contagion.
A man who travelled back to Kathmandu with his family members hiding in such a truck shares, “I am worried that I may not be able to help my daughter despite coming back to Kathmandu as I lack knowledge and skills required to facilitate the online classes even though we have access to a computer and the internet at home.”
While those having computers and the internet at home are also unprepared to kickstart the online classes, one can easily imagine the current status of the parents who have neither a computer nor an internet connection. In the light of insufficient preparation of educational stakeholders and a huge number of parents and students who do not possess resources required for digital education, the introduction of online classes may well intensify the digital divide.  Educational inequalities are also exacerbated between well-resourced and under-resourced schools that have pre-existed in Nepal’s education systems. This further creates inequalities in the Nepali society.
Like other disasters and emergencies, the Covid-19 outbreak has also differential impacts on people and they are affected disproportionately based on various intersecting factors such as gender, geography, and socioeconomic status.
Many countries have imposed lockdowns, closing schools and universities for months. According to a UNESCO estimate, 1.7 billion students, or more than 90% of the world’s learners are forced to stay at home due to the Covid-19 lockdowns across the globe. In most of the places, online classes have been embraced as the best solution.
The government of Nepal has also enforced the nationwide lockdown. Schools and universities are closed and major examinations are halted including the SEE and grade 11 and 12 finals. Over 35,000 schools are currently closed and over eight million students are staying at home. Meanwhile, some private schools have opted to go digital and operate online classes. But, concerns of thousands of the parents like Shanti Nepal and the man who travelled to Kathmandu hiding in a vegetable truck have not been addressed.
The digital divide refers to the gap between people and regions that have access to modern information and communications technology, and those that do not have or only have restricted access. ‘Technology’ can include telephones, televisions, personal computers, and the internet. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a digital divide as “the economic, educational, and social inequalities between those who have computers and online access and those who do not”. The digital divide typically exists between those in cities and those in rural areas; between the educated and the uneducated; between socioeconomic groups; and, between the developed and developing nations globally. Even among the populations with some access to technology, the digital divide can be in existence in the form of lower-performance computers and devices and lower-speed or unreliable internet connections.
According to the 2011 national census, only 7.28% of households own a computer and as little as 3.33% have a household internet connection in Nepal. The ownership of radio, television, and mobile phones stood at 50.82%, 36.45%, and 64.63% respectively. The Nepal Media Landscape Survey carried out by Sharecast Initiative Nepal in 2018 illustrates that the ownership of radio sets and mobile phones has increased to 59% and 98% respectively. Similarly, the survey shows that 72% of households in Nepal own a TV set and nearly 60% of people watch television every day. While the ownership of these household amenities has increased dramatically since 2011, the disparity in the distribution of these resources between urban and rural areas and across classes is still high.
The equipment and facilities the online classes require surely are not affordable for many people even in the normal condition in countries like ours where 24.8% of the population is living under the poverty line. Now, with the lockdown in effect, the purchasing power of many people in Nepal has been further reduced as many have lost their jobs due to the global pandemic and are finding it extremely difficult to provide for their families. Unavailability of the resources required for e-learning may take many children away from the education system. Such children are most likely to be engaged in activities that are harmful to their social, physical, and emotional development. Many of them might end as child labourers.
Similarly, online classes may have detrimental impacts on the existing educational inequalities, especially between the students of public and private schools. Out of 29,000 public schools in Nepal, only 13% are equipped with computer labs and internet facilities. This is the ratio of schools equipped with computers and the internet, not the students. Therefore, making online classes inclusive and accessible, particularly to poor families and those living in rural areas, is an uphill climb that the country’s education system needs to make.

The coronavirus crisis has provided an unprecedented opportunity to redefine the education system. But, this also calls for: 1) massive investments to increase access to computers, the internet and other equipment particularly among economically poor families; 2) carefully planned strategies in consultation with education experts and learning from the best practices around the globe; 3) well-coordinated context-specific efforts from education authorities and three tiers of government; 4) accessible and affordable services from telecommunication and internet service providers; 5) upgrading the technical know-how of teachers and incentivising creativity and innovation; and 6) effective use of radio, television, and telephones in distance learning. Apart from delivering lectures, assignments, and curricular contents,  e-learning classrooms, and online platforms should be used more to help students to think critically, be creative, appreciate their surroundings and nature, learn life skills, provide psychosocial support and ensure mental wellbeing.
This time should be taken as an opportunity to decide the face of future learning. As confusion rules the education stakeholders now, a new modality of education may easily get through and become familiar in a short time. Therefore, education authorities should introduce a digital learning system that will make sure that the educational activities do not have to wait until the pandemic is over. In doing so, we need to ensure that the alternative modality of education will not amplify inequalities by putting under-resourced students at a greater disadvantage than those of wealthier families.

Apparently hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak across the world recently, the government of Nepal has decided to halt regular schedules of staff recruitment indefinitely. The government’s decision aims at avoiding any financial crisis in the country.
A cabinet meeting held last week made the decision. Following that, Chief Secretary Lok Darshan Regmi has recently sent a letter to the Public Service Commission, responsible for the recruitment of staff, to halt all recruitment procedures, except for emergency cases, till the next notice. The decision will also affect recruitment procedures in security agencies and public service utilities.

At such time, we thought it would be better not to spend any money on publishing vacancy announcements now.”

Freedom Forum, an NGO working for press freedom and freedom of expression, says the Nepali press has been brought under state surveillance of late.
In its annual report released on Sunday on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, the organisation, however, maintains, “Despite sheer political hostility and intolerance, an active role of journalists and media houses to save free press by holding public authorities and officials accountable for their misconduct and irregularities is worth noting.”
The report reads, “As even the top leadership in political parties, especially the ruling one, is showing severe intolerance, other state apparatus are encouraged to follow suit. It is resulted in belittling of the role of the free press in a democracy, panicked journalists, and fomented efforts to control information regime.”
Whereas 104 incidents of violation of press freedom were reported last year, int increased to 107 this year (May 1, 2019-April 30, 2020), according to the organisation. These cases affected 206 journalists in total.
The report has also mentioned that the outbreak of the Covid-19 in the past month has added additional challenges to the status of press freedom in Nepal. “It has resulted in journalists’ loss of jobs, closure of many small media and curtailment of news from the big media. Citizen’s right to information, free speech, free press, and the entire media industry have been badly dented with this.”",-,"Sun, 03 May 2020 05:28:05 +0000"

After weeks of being dispatched, 30,000 coronavirus test kits to be gifted by the Swiss government to Nepal have arrived in Kathmandu on Thursday evening.
Swiss Ambassador to Nepal, Elisabeth von Capeller, handed over them to Minister for Health and Population, Bhanu Bhakta Dhakal, at the Tribhuvan International Airport of Kathmandu, yesterday.

But yesterday, the Nepal Airlines widebody aircraft chartered by the Australian Embassy to evacuate its citizens stranded in Nepal transported the kits from Singapore on its way back to Kathmandu.
Efforts had been made to reroute the aircraft via Malaysia. But owing to the Australian Embassy’s disagreement, the kits were taken to Singapore from Malaysia via a land route.

With the current Covid-19 crisis forcing everyone to be locked inside homes, it has halted almost every industry from aviation to hospitality and education. The degree of impact caused by the virus is enormous given that most of the world’s economies are facing recession with the fear of depression coming the way, leading to economic chaos and imbalance. One of the promising solutions to continue with most businesses and industries’ activities and pursue cash flows is the implementation of digital tools and platforms.
Education is one of those sectors hardly hit by the virus as schools are closed and learning is somehow disturbed. More than 1.2 billion children are out of the classrooms. With the uncertainty around the current situation, many institutions are practicing e-learning, which is simply a method of learning using online video conferencing platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and different social media platforms. Companies like BYJU’S are seeing a significant jump in the number of students using their products. Even before the crisis, the investment in education technology reached $19 billion approximately in 2019 and is poised to reach $350 billion by 2025, highlighting the rising market for online education.
The lockdown that started on March 24, now extended until May 18, has caused schools, colleges, and universities to remain closed and students are out of classrooms. A few schools have started online education to continue with their academic calendar, but the adaptability remains questionable. So, how does the future of e-learning hold for Nepal?

In Nepal, e-learning is still in its infancy with different sorts of challenges still there, posing threats to effective learning. Some schools and colleges have even started with online education in partnership with the parents and educational boards. But the question remains: whether the methods will be effective. Before issuing any order or instruction to pursue e-learning, there are a few questions that the government, concerned authorities, and organisations need to address:
How many students and teachers do actually have access to electricity and internet services?
How many people have knowledge and literacy required to operate the digital platforms?
Are there adequate training and capacity building programmes launched for teachers and students?
Is there any proper evaluation and assessment of the people facilitated with sound electricity and internet services and those who are not?
Before the adoption of e-learning, infrastructural development is the most critical step in the context of Nepal. There should be a clear mapping of students’ and teachers’ accessibility to those services. The government must focus on building capabilities including stable internet services, electricity, and access to devices including smartphones and laptops to different users. A survey by an internet service provider recently reveals that just 17% of its total users have access to fixed broadband and most people rely on mobile data, which makes online education extremely expensive and inaccessible in the current context. Partnering with the best technology partners inside and outside the country for infrastructural development appears to be one of the major elements in the roadmap to digital education.

Academic institutions need to study, analyse, and plan thoroughly to introduce online education models. Strict rules, and guidelines and proper training should be prepared and coordinated to monitor, standardise, and streamline the utilisation of online learning platforms.
But, for want of all these, it seems the traditional chalk-duster learning method will continue to remain important and dominate the Nepali education market for the next many years. The possibility of e-learning looks a long road ahead in the context of Nepal and the full-phase adaptation of technology for education will take at least another decade, that too only if the government continuously supports the investment and development of infrastructures required.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/why-feeding-animals-and-birds-during-the-lockdown-can-be-a-wrong-idea.html,"With the nationwide lockdown in effect, people have been staying at their homes, leaving the animals outside hungry. In a bid to help the innocent creatures sustain in this critical time, some volunteers have taken the responsibility to feed these animals and birds. While many are praising the initiative, zoologists, on the other hand, do not support this movement to feed the animals and birds. Some have raised questions regarding its quality while others feel the lockdown is the right time for letting the animals and birds seek out their food naturally.
OnlineKhabar recently asked veteran zoologist Mukesh Chalise to explain why it is wrong to feed the animals and birds which are hungry and helpless.
Excerpts:
People are feeding the hungry dogs, monkeys, and pigeons during this lockdown. Should we continue to do that?
The affection being shown towards the animals is appreciable. But, I feel, making them dependent on humans for food is wrong. During this time of crisis, we should also not forget that diseases like bird flu and swine flu that created havoc before come from animals and birds.
Another question is who is checking the quality of the feed being given to the animals. I do not think there has been any such step. There is no news of the feed–be it wheat, rice, or bananas–being distributed in the recommendation of a veterinarian or a doctor.
Nevertheless, I think we should give priority to humans. Kathmandu is home to approximately five million people, among which the majority are manual workers, who survive on their daily wages. With 45 days into the lockdown, they are suffering–with no money and no food. So, I appreciate the local authorities distributing food for the residents, free of cost.
Can you please explain more on how we are making them dependent on distributing food? 
In the Kathmandu Valley, we can see many seasonal birds like heron and raven soar across the sky gallantly. Herons feed on the fish from the Manohara River, but if we start collecting the fish in one place, they will stop visiting the river. If we start feeding the foxes, jackals, mongooses, etc, their natural way of life will be disturbed, rendering them weak and vulnerable against natural obstacles and diseases.
It has been speculated that the coronavirus originated in the bats, while bird flu from birds and HIV/AIDS from the monkeys. If animals can transmit diseases to humans, humans are capable of transmitting diseases to animals too. Monkeys in the Pashupati and Swayambhu areas are sick from cold and cough and diarrhoea. They are the result of receiving food from infected humans. Certainly, giving food to animals is an act of love, but their consequences can be fatal.
But, there were reports of dogs inside Singhadurbar dying of hunger. Do you think we should let them die?
We must first understand why the dogs reached the area. If we are to keep the food like rice grains or even fish everywhere, then the herons will also be seen in the area from tomorrow.
An example can be of people giving fruits and leafy vegetables to appease the wild animals in Pathalaiya and East Bardibas. As a result, lately, there is the news of animals waiting in lines to get food on the streets, like beggars. We have made the rhinos in Sauraha beggars too. Wild buffaloes in Koshi Tappu have also become dependent. Human interference in the natural process is not wise. We should think about whether we are making their habits better or worse.
Are humans the only reason for the habitual change seen in the animals?
If the monkeys in the Pashupati and Swayambhu areas had continued to live on the trees or the fruits only, they would have never disturbed the humans visiting the holy places. But, as we know, the monkeys attack and try to snatch even if we carry the smallest of plastic bags. We are the ones who encouraged that behaviour. We made them lazy and greedy. We taught them that humans carry food in such bags. However, they are not aware of humans carrying the diseases and that they can get infected. But we humans do (and we should be responsible).
What can we do to revert to the natural order for the animals and birds?
We should first ensure and protect their natural habitat. Those who have taken shelter in the city, among humans, should be protected as naturally as possible. One way can be to grow the plants and trees that bear foods that the animals such as monkeys will eat in the Pashupati and Swayambhu areas. If we have to feed them, we should ensure their safety and that of the humans, rather than haphazardly throwing and feeding them.
If the animals’ numbers rise naturally, the natural order will be restored. We should not devoid them of their natural traits or transfer diseases. We should think of ways to make them independent, to feed on their own, and to fight against any kind of disease or epidemic.",-,"Sat, 09 May 2020 03:41:52 +0000"

The Kathmandu-based Chinese Embassy has claimed that the issue regarding an abusive behaviour against Nepali police personnel by Chinese nationals in Singhadurbar of Kathmandu yesterday, has been resolved.
Issuing a press note, the embassy has directed its citizen residing in Nepal currently to have patience and to stay inside as per the directions given by the Nepal government till the international flights will resume.
It further states any conflict and disagreement that arise during the ongoing coronavirus crisis worldwide will be resolved jointly as needed with a common understanding between the two nations.
On Friday, a group of Chinese nationals had staged a protest in front of the main entrance of Singhdurbar, which resulted in physical abuse on the Nepali personnel on duty.
The Chinese government has already repatriated 340 of its citizen back to the country to date. But, many are still stranded in  Nepal with limited flights.
Nepal has suspended all international flights till May 31.",-,"Sat, 09 May 2020 05:46:14 +0000"

After one and a half months of the lockdown, some factories in the Sunsari-Morang industrial corridor have come into operation following the government’s directive to partially open the businesses.
About 100 businesses out of 650 have come into operation. However, the businesspersons have expressed their dilemma regarding the operation amid the lack of raw materials, human resources, and the market.
Arihanta Multifibres’ administration officer Ramesh Subba says, “During the crisis, it is not possible to operate the full-fledged business. So, with extreme care, we have followed the preventive measures and open as many factories as possible. However, the lack of raw materials and the market is a constant challenge.”
Similarly, Rijal Polytech Industry’s operator Navin Rijal has expressed the dilemma that has arisen due to the lack of clear instructions from the government. “It seems the government officials have not done their homework. It is not a big deal to open the industries; however, there was a lack of preparation to work on the market for the products. Opening the businesses in this situation will only put more load on the businesspersons.”
Morang Businesspersons Association chair and industrialist Prakash Mundadaa says operating businesses is not feasible during this period. “Raw materials are imported from India and other third countries. However, they all are also locked down. Hence, we have to cut down on the production and operate only partially.”",-,"Sat, 09 May 2020 10:50:48 +0000"

“This unilateral act runs against the understanding reached between the two countries including at the level of Prime Ministers that a solution to boundary issues would be sought through negotiation.”

Rautahat, May 9
Taking the opportunity of the lockdown, India is found to have been strengthening an illegal dyke near Nepal-India border pillars across the Ishnath municipality of Rautahat district in southern Nepal.
Fearing that it would increase the risk of inundation in the town in the upcoming monsoon, locals have expressed fury over the move. The Banjaraha settlement of the municipality suffers inundations every monsoon.
About a decade ago, India had built the illegal dyke that lies east of the border pillar number 346, stretching to Banjaraha. Now, the Indian side is raising the height of that dyke by more than five feet using soil.
It is forbidden to build any kind of structure, temporary or concrete, in the no man’s land. Instead of bringing the structure down, India has been adding sacks upon sacks filled with soil and rocks to increase the dyke’s height.
Even after the local authorities have reported about the illegal structure being built against the written agreement between the two countries, Ishnath-1 ward chief Bigu Sah informs, there has been no response from the central government’s side.
“With the dyke’s length of over two kilometres, height 15 feet and depth of 10 metres, the Indian side has left no outlet for Nepal to discharge the water,” Sah adds.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/in-locked-down-nepal-webinars-are-popular-but-spammers-frequently-spoil-them.html,"
On April 27, NxtGen, a nonprofit organisation under the Pulchowk Engineering Campus, hosted a webinar on Covid-19 preparedness for students. During the event, the organisers noticed some audience members from fake email addresses violating cybersecurity laws, which left the audience and the speakers tense.
The organisers think their purpose of joining the webinar was disturbing In other words, they were ‘spammers’.
“I felt disgusted; I could not listen to the things they were saying to a teacher and guests. So, for a moment I exited the webinar,” Shishir Panta, one of the attendees of that webinar narrates his experience of the webinar.
With the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country extended time and again, many organisations have resorted to webinars and online meetings to discuss various issues. However, many of them have reported attacks from spammers.
What do they do?
Webinars are in trend nowadays; so are the webinar spamming and spammers. As webinars and online discussions, classes and meetings have been the only possible medium to communicate between the organisations and people amid the lockdown, these webinars have been constantly disturbed by the spammers who anonymously participate in those webinars with the sole motive of disturbing the session.

Panta explains his experience of encountering a spammer, “Initially, the webinar was going quite well until a few fellows barged in and made a mess of the situation. They started talking dirty things repeatedly, interrupting and humiliating the speakers and organisers.”
When he re-entered the session, he briefs that the whole scenario was disgusting and pathetic. It was not until the organisers blocked those people, webinar resumed with its flows.
NxtGen’s president Jay Kishan Panjiyar claims, “As, our event was the first victim of these spammers in Nepal, we were completely unaware about the webinar spamming and spammers earlier.”
But, NxtGen is not only the sole victim of such happenings. There are many who fall prey to such incidents. Girls in Tech-Nepal also faced a similar situation, in which the spammers muted the host, libeled and similar spamming activity like muting the host and moderator while they are speaking, slandering and defaming them. Some of them played songs in between, spoke foul words time and again. Similarly, Robotics Association of Nepal (RAN) also faced similar occurrences in a virtual panel discussion hosted on April 27 by its Miss Tech wing.
How do spammers get into the webinars?
Panjiyar describes, “We hosted the webinar using Google Meet as it has the capacity of 250 people. It is designed in such a way that a link has to be shared to invite the attendees to the event. We shared that link on our Facebook page and in our networks. We shared the link publicly thinking it would benefit every student. But, it let the spammers enter the webinar.”
Likewise, Astha Sharma, Volunteer Managing Director at Girls in Tech-Nepal, narrates her experience of how the intruders get into their webinar session, “First of all, we publish the Google forms for registration of the interested participants for our webinar. Then, we mail those who have filled up that form and registered for the session a link of the webinar mentioning all the required details. Though we don’t make public that link, anyone having that link can attend the session as well as can share with others.”
Sharma suspects there are some organised groups of spammers who are looking for some opportunities to disturb. Some of them might appear genuine at first and register duly, completing all the requirements, but change into spammers later.

A cybersecurity analyst at THREATNIX, a company providing professional cybersecurity services, Abiral Shrestha explains how the spammers enter the webinars, “The organisers are not aware of preventive measures that need to be applied while organising the webinars. The spammers generally get into these improperly configured webinars. The webinars meant to be private to certain groups of people are also sometimes accidentally made public by sharing links publicly.”
How to identify the spammers?
Shrestha suggests the organisers can identify spammers by segregating the emails and usernames that look suspicious, tracking accounts of people trying to impersonate celebrities/politicians and analysing previous spamming activities of the viewers. However, he maintains, “During big public webinars, it can be quite hard to track them unless they make some abusive comments or share some malicious links.”
However, Sharma complains, “It is quite difficult to find who the actual spammers are because some of them have used authentic names, some of them have opened four to five tabs altogether. One does not have one particular style of identifying them.”
Meanwhile, Panjiyar shares his experience of tracking the spammers. “Firstly, the webinar was being recorded. So, we had records of their faces, names, and email addresses. Secondly, while entering the webinar, emails are saved for future use. Tracing such emails, we got such breachers.”
Why do they spam anyway?
Cybersecurity analyst Shrestha says the spammers generally spam webinars for monetary benefits. However, in the case of Nepal, they just tend to do it for fun and just to prove the point that they can, he believes.
In addition, Sharma and Panjiyar have noticed that most of the spammers were minors; they were either +2 students or undergraduates unaware of the consequences and laws.
Panjiyar views, “Their motive is just to ruin the events happening digitally. Maybe they are not able to tolerate productive activities going on during the lockdown.”

Sharma agrees, “Their sole intention is to disturb the webinar. Rather than blaming the weakness of any such video conferencing platform, the main problem lies within the mindset of such intruders. Some of them also claimed they did so as they were bored.”
What does it matter?
Though the spammers do not have any serious intention behind their activities, they have a serious impact on the effectiveness of such online events, according to the organisers.
Sharma asserts, “The entire hard work in hosting webinars goes in vain after such interventions from the spammers. Such incidents let the confidence of the hosts down.”
She also fears that such incidents might give a negative impression of the entire country to foreign participants. She narrates, “On that particular day, we had a foreign facilitator from Sri Lanka, currently living in Australia and working for Microsoft. He was constantly asking, ‘Are such activities normal in Nepal?’ Despite the constant disturbances, he continued his presentation until the situation went out of control and the webinar got terminated.”
“As all the international speakers may not have any idea about Nepal, we are worried that they might judge our country and the people through these incidents only,” opines Sharma. Panjiyar also adds, “It is a matter of shame for the organisers as well.”
He also narrates a similar experience, “As one of the speakers we had was the Assistant Dean of the Institute of Engineering (Tribhuvan University), he was disappointed and embarrassed because some spammers tried to politicse the event. Likewise, one of our speakers left the webinar halfway. Also, we had many female participants, and  using vulgar words made them leave.”
“One of my team members was with his family, saying we have organised such a great event. Just think, what might have happened to him and his family,” asks Panjiyar.",-,"Sun, 10 May 2020 05:12:38 +0000"

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/cycling-from-bhim-dunga-via-switzerland-park-to-kalu-pandey-memorial-ground-part-i.html,"Kathmandu offers every mountain biker bountiful to explore outdoors—intimate hills, lush woods, laidback countryside, a breath of fresh air, and by far, nature at its best. No sooner you are done with one fascinating jaunt than another awaits you. It’s all yours for the taking. All you got to do is make your mind up, prep up your bike, and hop onto your saddle.
 
The past two months of December 2019 and January 2020, with cold spells followed by dull overcast skies, erratic showers, and no sun for days, had dampened my mountain biking spirit close to naught.  The first week of February showed a little promise, though.
Warmer and sunny days nudged me awake to dust my mountain bike and muse over some locales to ride. It also seemed long-overdue to stretch out my slackened muscles. I had heard a lot about the Kalu Pandey Hills among bikers for the track’s challenging inclines. I asked my neighbourhood cycling partner, Shayeet, if he would be interested in riding to those hills. He jumped at the offer.
Off to the hills
On a weekday, we left for Kalu Pandey. The early morning sun seemed to promise crisp weather. “Great weather,” Shayeet remarked as we jumped on to our saddles.  We hit the Ring Road and headed for Sitapaila. Since I was a little confused about the route, I had called earlier an old pro-biker friend who had biked there several times. He suggested we took the Sitapaila—Ramkot route.

Oversight
After something like one-half kilometre westward after Sitapaila, it turned out, we had, unwittingly, taken a wrong turn at a fork. Instead of heading straight to Ramkot, we took the road on our right towards the Druk Amitabh Mountain Monastery, otherwise known as Seto Gumba (white monastery).
Without going uphill to the monastery, we headed further north to Ichangu Narayan. The paved road turned into a stiff climb and led towards wooded heights flanked by Nagarjun hills. Jamacho, with its dense, lush forest, towered high on our right. I still thought we were on the right track. We were not.

Not until we pedalled past the Ichangu Narayan Vishnu Temple and climbed a hill leaving behind a bazaar area and clusters of houses than I had the hunch that we had taken the wrong route. “Shayeet, we better ask some locals, or else we will get lost,” I called out.
We stopped by a house and approached a local guy. We had indeed taken a circuitous route. The guy told us we needed to climb the hill ahead and turn south towards Seto Gumba, then take the downhill dirt road to Ramkot. We had just done a steep climb, now another awaited. “Darn it,” Shayeet called out in frustration. Some 45 minutes later, we met a side track, one went down west, while the other headed east towards Seto Gumba.

We stopped by a teashop and asked the shop owner. “Head down along that wooded hill,” he pointed a finger a little to the south and said, “and just stick to the dirt road; that will take you straight off to Ramkot.  After that, there would be no mistaking the road to Kalu Pandey. Just ask around.”

Countryside
The height rolled out a view of Ramkot, a sprawling cluster of houses at the foothill. I could make out from the height the road that cut right across sprawling fields and the countryside from Sitapaila and could even locate the turnoff where we had screwed up.

The ridge we were on seemed to burst into colours as clumps of golden marigold dotted the hillside, lending a pleasant setting to the rural landscape. They could not be wild, could they, I asked myself? The locals around the place must be into marigold farming, I mused. On the other hand, haze and smog seemed to cloak the far-off suburbs like a veil—a depressing sight indeed.
Ramkot 
The gravelly downhill section proved a real thrill as we coasted down the winding track, across quiet woods, with soaring pine trees. It made us forget the long hard climb we just did. It hardly took us 20 minutes to reach Dandapauwa and another 10 minutes to Ramkot Bazaar.

It was past one in the afternoon, and we were starving. Our lunch included, as it often did on our rides, our favourite dal-bhat. The food, contrary to the lady owner’s heaping praise on it, tasted bland. But we ate our fill as we were hungry. At least, the carb from dal-bhat would help on the gruelling incline that followed next.
After a half-hour time-out, we hit the road again and headed southwest in the direction of Kalu Pandey Hills. It suddenly struck me a slight detour to Bhim Dunga would not be a bad idea and take not very long. So, we took the turn-off to our right.
Detour
I had heard a lot about the stiff climbs to Kalu Pandey. But the one-half kilometre to Bhim Dunga turned out the ‘mother of all uphills’ and a mountain biker’s worst nightmare. Even Shayeet, who considered himself a tough uphiller, had to get off his bike and push. For me, even shoving my bike on that gradient seemed punishing, let alone riding.
 

After sweating it out for almost 25 minutes on the incline, the sight of the crest came as a welcome respite. That was the second ridge we had scaled that day.

Not ‘Bhim Dhunga’
A little away from habitation, the ridge bore a large stone altar with three gajurs (pinnacles) built on the raised ground. It gave the impression of a midget temple. The front of the stonework included two deities, one was the Ganesh hands down, but I could not place the other chiselled form as it was little disfigured, which stood with one arm holding what looked like a Gada (mace).
As I still wondered about the deity, an elderly fellow arrived on the scene and said the figure belonged to Bhimsen. To my great delight, he also threw light upon the history of the place. “Everyone seems to call this place ‘Bhim Dhunga’, but the actual name happens to be ‘Bhim Dunga’, dunga for a boat,” he explained and gave an account of the ancient folklore.

As the legend goes, Bhimsen of Mahabharat fame in days of Kali Yuga (3,102 BC) once happened to visit the ridge, which served as a ledge above a huge lake, said to be present Kathmandu Valley. Spellbound, he wished to explore the waters. He sent for a boat and took a ride. “That is said to have named the place Bhim Dunga,” he summed up. The grueling ride to Bhim Dunga, after all, turned out well worth a visit.
After a brief breather, we struck northeast towards Kalu Pandey. I had the feeling we would be doing another formidable climb as the forthcoming destination was higher than Bhim Dunga. My instinct came right. Hardly had we finished a downhill section, the road that branched out to Kalu Pandey took on a steep climb. The only upside to it was its paved sections.

Some 45 minutes struggling on the long steep climb, we arrived at a flatter section. The place turned out to be Switzerland Park, lately a popular getaway. We stopped for tea at a shop next to the park. The fellow-owner graciously cast light upon how the place came to be called by that name, which sounded nothing but out of place.
The story went like that. About a decade ago, when there were no roads, only walking trails to the hills of Dahachok, a group of Swiss backpackers happened to hike there with a guide, a local from the village. The hills then held pristine locales—untouched, rarely explored, free of pollution, and miles away from the chaos of the metropolis.

“Sheer bliss,” uttered one of the Swiss backpackers, impressed. “This place reminds me of my own country back home,” he told the guide. The guide, at social gatherings or when dropping by the local teashops to chat with friends and co-villagers, often waxed eloquent on that incident.  Soon, word got around in pigeon circle in the small village.
The local villagers began calling the place Switzerland Danda (hill), wooing every hiker that went by.  A few years later, someone from the village came up with the idea of turning it into a park. “In recent years, the park has become a popular picnic venue for Kathmandu people. If you come here on weekends, the park virtually turns into a carnival with loudspeakers belting out blaring music heard miles away,” he said with a grin.
We entered the park and took a fleeting look around. Much to our dismay, the place stank, and the ugly tin-roofed shelters looked hideous—only serving as a blot on the landscape. Piles of trash littered the sides into the bargain. Disappointed, we left for our final destination of the day, Kalu Pandey Memorial Park, hoping it would not let us down.

Kathmandu, May 11
In the wake of India opening a link road, apparently encroaching on the Nepali territory, the government is preparing to establish an Armed Police Force border outpost (APF BOP) in the disputed Kalapani region.
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, says the government’s decision to establish a BOP in Chharung of Kalapani region has not been implemented due to several reasons, but preparations to implement it are at the final state now.
“We had been waiting for some time as managing permanent structures there was difficult due to the region’s altitude. But, we will establish a BOP in the next few days,” he told lawmakers during a meeting of the International Relations and Labour Committee in Parliament today.
A helicopter would fly in a day or two carrying the security personnel there, he assured.
He informed the committee that 182 families live in the region in the summer who come to the lower region of the Darchula district in the winter. There is not a way connecting that part to the rest of the country and the villagers are forced to travel via India, to and fro. “But we will construct a walking trail in the first phase and a motorway in the second phase to end this situation. We have allocated budget accordingly,” he assured.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-incentives-for-electric-cars-in-nepal-can-be-a-risky-affair-economically.html,"
Electric vehicles (EVs) first came into existence in the mid-19th century when electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of that time. The share of EVs in the world is increasing day by day. Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly important as not only do they reduce noise and pollution, but they also can be used to reduce the dependence of transport on imported oil.
Reduced emission is a major advantage of EVs over internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) despite the issue of battery recycling and disposal in the EVs. Lowered operation and maintenance charge is another advantage. The EVs’ efficiency is about three times higher than the ICEVs. Accordingly, the number of EVs is increasing worldwide.
On the other hand, many countries are banning ICEVs, although partially. India and China, our immediate neighbours, have softly planned to make their transportation systems fully electric, by 2030. Nepal cannot run in the opposite direction of the world. The era of EVs has started in Nepal too.
Nepal can get a lot of advantages from this era in reducing the trade deficit by replacing imported oil by own-generated hydro-electricity. Accordingly, the government has also planned to increase the electric fleet share here also. The Electric Mobility Action Plan formulated by the government has proposed to transform at least 20% of the fleet of public vehicles into electric ones by 2020. For this, a number of subsidies and incentives have been given for the import of EVs, not only for the public but also for private purposes. These days, the government is encouraging the use of EVs by imposing only 10 per cent customs duty and 13 per cent value-added tax while the internal combustion engine cars (ICECs) still retain their 240 per cent import duty. The road tax is also not applicable to the EVs.
However, not only do these subsidies and incentives reduce the revenue collection but they also likely to create some major problems in the near future.
File: Electric buses of Sajha Yatayat
Firstly, a lot of research and technological advancements are happening about the EVs and their batteries. As a result, it is sure that the manufacturing costs of the EVs will be much lower tomorrow than today. Thus, these incentives and subsidies on the EVs are prone to create a locked-in effect, the phenomenon where the original system cannot be altered later with already knowing that the system is inefficient.
The lower manufacturing cost of the EVs in the near future with subsidies and incentives will promote more electric cars. The current availability of roads in cities like Kathmandu cannot withstand the greater share of private vehicles. Thus, in the near future, the government will need to reduce and eliminate subsidies and incentives to decrease the ECs’ attraction. But, the time will be late to do so. Some political and social pressure will arise and that makes the condition locked-in.
Then, a question arises: What about the emission control goal? But, this goal also should be viewed from an economic perspective. There is always some trade between emission control and congestion. If we go for emission control by introducing ECs, the cost of congestion will rise due to the increased number of the vehicle fleet. The introduction of EVs should be within that level where the cost of congestion is overcome by the benefits of emission control. So, a balance between the introduction of EVs for emission control and traffic congestion is always necessary.
Secondly, a balance between electricity supply and demand of electricity is necessary. As recently as 2010, the Swedish government has attempted to kick-start sales through generous grants and has achieved some success. But there is a problem. The demand for electricity in cities is increasing faster than the supply can keep up, especially in the capital, Stockholm. This example should not be repeated in Nepal.
Nepal is still not fully independent in electricity. It takes some time to fulfill the household and industrial demand. Then only, the use of electricity on the transportation system is rational.
These two reasons will explicitly encourage us not to rush for the EVs. Our main focus should be promoting the EVs, but not in a way to bring a paradigm shift in the use of private vehicles. If we continue the subsidies and incentives like now, this mode shift is sure and the vehicle fleet will increase, resulting in the increased traffic congestion. Moreover, we need some time to fulfill the electricity demand for EVs.
What should we do now? The taxation system for the electric cars should be as same as that for the ICECs now. This will still collect sufficient national revenue and also control the likely increase of private vehicles share due to the introduction of the EVs in the near future. But, the introduction of public EVs should not be limited. With all these actions too, it is sure that the international market will automatically change Nepal’s ICEVs era into the EVs era in some years.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/why-does-the-coronavirus-infection-return-after-recovery.html,"File: Coronavirus tests are underway at a lab in Nepalgunj.
Three people–each from Kathmandu, Birgunj, and Rautahat–tested positive for the novel coronavirus even after recovery. Such recurring cases have intensified the fear of infection amongst the people. Many have raised the question: Can the virus be transmitted again from those patients who have been confirmed recovered and discharged.
Public health experts do not have a definite answer to this question. Most of them opine that it is difficult to say whether such people can transmit the disease. Therefore, the recovered patients who tested positive again are kept in isolation again, they inform.
According to one expert, the virus, whether active or in the process of becoming inactive, shows positive results in the PCR test. Whereas the inactive virus does not transmit the infection to others, only those that are alive can. He also suggests that a virus culture is necessary to know if the virus that tested positive in the PCR test is inactive or active.
He recommends that it is more appropriate to refer to such cases as ‘re-positive’ cases instead of ‘re-infection cases’ because no one else transmits the virus, rather the virus present in one’s own body is seen in the test again in such cases.
Testing positive again is normal

Though this tendency is new for Nepal, it is not the first time in the world that those who have returned home after recovering have retested positive for a particular infection.
A large number of people in South Korea, the country believed to have succeeded in controlling the coronavirus spread, tested positive again after their recovery. In China too, 14 per cent of the patients who had returned home after recovery tested positive again. In Japan, it is 10 per cent.
As per public health scientist Dr. Sameer Mani Dixit, when any Covid-19-infected person, who is either in the process of recovery or just completed it, coughs, inactivated virus particles and dead cells come out to their throats from their lungs. If one goes for a follow-up and his/her samples are taken and tested during such a period, the persons test positive in the PCR test.
“This is a normal process,” says a genetic scientist adding, “The sensitivity of PCR test is 70 per cent worldwide, and similar cases are occurring in many other places as well.”
Reappearance after recovery
According to a Quartz article, when a Covid-19 patient is healing, the virus cells become inactive. And, when the virus is released from different cells, sometimes a sufficient number of the virus cells cannot come to the swab while collecting the sample. The test from such swab results in negative. But, sometimes, when the virus is leaving the cells, a sufficient number of the virus cells accumulate in the swab, and such a swab test results in positive.
Also, public health experts notify that when the patient does not get enough time to heal, s/he may retest positive for the Covid-19. However, to find out if the virus is active, the virus load should also be checked during the PCR test.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines on clinical management, the patients can be discharged from the hospital after receiving two consecutive negative reports. Similarly, clinically recovered patients can be discharged after 24 hours. So far, Covid-19 patients are said to recover in two weeks. All three people who tested positive again in Nepal were discharged after receiving negative reports three times in a row. Also, two of the three were hospitalised for more than two weeks.
Is human error responsible?
A Nepali evacuee is tested for coronavirus during the quarantine in Kharipati, Bhaktapur, in February 2020.
Virologist Sudeep Khadka believes that the major reasons for such cases are human and technical errors. Sometimes, the recovered patients may test positive again after transmitting the virus from another infected person. He stresses, “Sometimes, the nose might be free of the virus, but it may be present in the trachea. So, it is very important to know how the samples are collected.” According to him, such reports come even when the health workers do not take enough samples from the patients.
He adds, “The RNA has to be handled very carefully. If proper precautions are not taken, it will be destroyed and the test result will be negative. If all the procedures are followed appropriately while collecting the next swab samples, another report can come positive.”
The WHO has also commented it is difficult to say exactly what is happening on such issues. It informs that the issues of those who were discharged from the hospital after recovery testing positive again are being studied.
“We are studying both the negative and positive reports and samples of people who have received such reports,” the WHO said, “First, it is important to confirm whether the swabs of those patients were collected properly or not. Covid-19 is a disease; we need more and more data to study about it.”
Researchers also report that even if the antibodies are produced in the body, it may test positive again. Research has concluded that the reactivation of the virus can be explained in many ways. However, the WHO said, “Currently, it would be too early to say anything about such cases retesting positive after recovery. We have been fighting this virus for months. This virus has changed a lot. It is difficult to know what will happen now, so we have to focus on developing vaccination.”",-,"Tue, 12 May 2020 05:27:39 +0000"

Kathmandu, May 12
A group of former bureaucrats has called the government to prepare for holding talks with India about the recently surfaced border dispute and internationalising it simultaneously.
‘Group 25+’, an informal group of former secretaries and joint secretariat of the government, says in its statement on Tuesday, “The government of Nepal needs to employ a double-pronged strategy to safeguard the nation’s interest: it should seriously continue to call on India to join a dialogue table to share evidence on the sovereign ownership of the India-occupied Nepal’s territory and at the same time, Nepal should raise clear and consistent voice on its sovereign ownership of territories currently under the Indian occupation in the UN, regional and bilateral forums.”
The group has further suggested that the occupation of Nepal’s territory and continued acts of aggression for territorial expansion by India should be a long-term agenda of Nepal’s integrated foreign, security and communication policy.",-,"Tue, 12 May 2020 08:39:19 +0000"

Kathmandu, May 13
Minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, Padma Kumari Aryal, says her ministry is ready to publish a new map of the country that also incorporates the disputed Kalapani region anytime, adding the map, however, is yet to be made public as the country is waiting for talks with India in this regard.
After India published its new political map in November last year incorporating the disputed region, the government of Nepal had also commissioned the ministry to publish the new map so as to give an encounter, owing to a widespread protest of the Indian move and Nepal’s inability to resist.
As India inaugurated a link road to Manasarovar via the disputed land last week, the government is again under the pressure to publish the new map as soon as possible.
In this context, the minister says in an interview with Onlinekhabar, “We have sufficient evidence in documents to prove that part belongs to us. Accordingly, we decided to make technical preparations to incorporate that into our map. But again, there were talks about moving forward on the basis of mutual consent. The government had launched some initiatives in that regard; India had also given some hints. So we did not publish the new map unilaterally.”
She assures, “If the talks head towards a positive direction, fine. But, they cannot conclude, we can publish the map.”",-,"Wed, 13 May 2020 06:10:50 +0000"

Nepal is going through some truly testing times now. The number of Covid-19 patients identified in the country has reached 191 so far, and it is apparent that our health system is struggling to handle a crisis of this enormity. There are, however, a number of efficient and innovative community-led practices that the government could immediately emulate across the country to more effectively track, trace, test, and treat individuals who have contracted the disease.
On 24 March 2020, the government of Nepal announced a nationwide lockdown to prevent the ‘import’ of the virus. The tracing and testing strategy, however, was snail-paced at its best. The government increased testing only in the third week of the lockdown, meaning that the first 14 days were essentially wasted. Had the government worked proactively in the initial two weeks, the process of gradually lifting the lockdown could have begun by now.
Under federalism, the onus for planning and implementing control measures during a crisis such as this one lies on the local governments. On the other hand, the management of public health emergencies, health sector disasters, and epidemics are a cross-cutting function across all three levels of governance. Considering this, the local governments can take an innovative approach through ‘unit action teams’ to complement the efforts of the federal and provincial governments in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.
In fact, a few local governments of Nepal have already put this strategy to test. Among them, the Simta rural municipality of Surkhet district in Karnali is the first onboard. The results, so far, have been encouraging.
Unit action team: An introduction
A ‘unit,’ in this case, is a population cluster that comprises 20-30 households. Local governments determine this by considering the pockets of households and their geographical accessibility. Every unit has at least one unit action team (UAT) that will be led by a locally nominated team leader. Depending on the population, there can be several UATs in each ward, which can be coordinated by the respective ward chairperson.  Each ward chairperson can also be responsible for the coordination of UAT activities across municipalities.  The mayor or chairperson of each local government can have the overall responsibility of formalising and implementing the UAT initiative in the municipalities, along with coordinating with the federal and provincial governments as required.
Implementation
Simta rural municipality has been implementing the UAT approach for about a month now. It has around 75 UATs with three to 11 UATs per ward. Each UAT is made up of about five to 12 members with at least one female member in each group.
The tasks of the UAT members mainly come under what we refer to as the 4 ‘R’s: Record, Recognise, Regulate, and Report.

As part of the recording, the UATs initially compile a list of all individuals, with details including name, age, gender, address, travel history, and any signs or symptoms of Covid-19 they may be showing, such as fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing. They also put together a list of highly frequented public places.
The recognition function, meanwhile, involves conducting daily follow-ups with households that have returnees from abroad for any Covid-19-like signs and symptoms. If such symptoms are seen, the ward chairperson is the first to be informed, who then contacts health facilities for further management. The team also assists in looking after the basic needs of the families.
Keeping people informed about the spread of Covid-19 and instructing them on protective behaviours that need to be followed constitute the regulation. Additionally, the teams strictly monitor individual households and assess how far UAT members are complying with home quarantine and lockdown directives provided by the government. At the same time, risk communication efforts continue to amplify key preventive measures, such as the use of masks, safe sneezing, coughing, and handwashing.
Finally, the teams report on any new members being added to their respective units, detailing developments of signs and symptoms. Planning safe transfers to assigned hospitals is also part of their duties, as is reporting shortages of basic supplies and logistics to the local body.
Key achievements
In this way, recognising that the virus is extremely contagious and capable of asymptomatic spread, Simta rural municipality has been able to mobilise the community to join the battle against Covid-19. Since the implementation of the UAT approach, we have observed some visible changes.
So far, Simta has been able to quarantine 145 households for 14 days, supervised by the team leader of the respective UAT. These are the households whose members had recently travelled out of the country, mainly India. As of now, none of the quarantined members have shown any sign of Covid-19.
In addition, with the support of the UATs, the municipality has been able to identify ultra-poor and vulnerable families in the need for immediate assistance during the ongoing lockdown. They are being provided with food and other essential logistics by the municipality with strict monitoring from the UATs.

However, the process has not been entirely smooth. The municipality lacks a central database that could provide information on the daily inflow and outflow of the population, making it difficult to track the overall progress. Carrying out an effective risk communication aimed at motivating the community was also a challenge, as was ensuring a steady supply of water for handwashing and sanitation facilities. Another issue had to do with the guidelines for Covid-19, which are primarily designed for the health sector. But given that a majority of the residents of Simta are farmers who own livestock, there was a clear need for guidelines and communication materials targeted at the agriculture sector.
The lockdown is only a means to prevent the spread of the disease, not an end. We urge the central government to emulate the standard practice of the UATs across the country. This unique community-based practice represents a reliable and sustainable approach for the local bodies to fight epidemics, as well as having the potential to work not just across different sectors, but also to set an example for other countries that are fighting the same battle.

Whereas the size of online markets for goods and services was growing steadily in Nepal for the past few years, the ongoing lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country has reinforced the importance of such markets. Daraz Group, a leading online shopping company of the country, in this context, has launched a new initiative called Daraz Sahayatri Programme with a view of supporting small and medium-scale entrepreneurs. Onlinekhabar has recently talked to the company’s Managing Director Lino Ahlering about the new initiative and overall impact of the lockdown on the online shopping scenario in Nepal.
Excerpts:
Please tell us about the Daraz Sahayatri Programme in the context of Covid-19 outbreak.
The majority of Daraz sellers are small and medium-scale entrepreneurs. In Nepal, the SMEs contribute around 22% of the GDP and generate employment for around 1.7 million people. Due to the Covid-19 crisis, many SMEs have been pushed to the brink and without support to the SMEs, the economy will be hit very hard. Thus, to contribute to lessening the impact, Daraz introduced the Daraz Sahayatri Programme.
This prorgramme is introduced to support the SMEs throughout Nepal. Through this programme, we will help existing and new sellers to conduct business all over Nepal through our digital platform. We will not take any marketplace fee from the sellers for two months, provide weekly payments, and enable express signups so that the interested SMEs can set up their online businesses on Daraz in a short amount of time. We will provide them with everything they need to run a successful online store on Daraz through education, training, and support.
Where do you think this programme is relevant in the context of Nepal?
We have seen that online shopping and food delivery companies have played a vital role whereas all other markets are shut currently. Consequently, they are fully supported by the respective governments.
The SMEs are the lifeblood of an economy. We are inviting them to operate online and expand their revenue streams by being able to sell their products all over Nepal. We are not only inviting them but also providing them with all of our resources for them to be able to do business again. It is very much true as seen in other countries that the SMEs could be empowered through e-commerce, especially now. And as an online marketplace with more than 4,000 sellers across the country, we already have a very sophisticated operational infrastructure to support the sale and delivery of goods throughout the country.
What are the chances of this project turning out to be a success in the current circumstances?
Much of the work of setting up an online store and learning how to operate it can be done online. So, we are currently focused on helping interested sellers sign up for the programme and set up their online stores in a record time. We will provide all the required education and training through the Daraz University and our dedicated staff. The programme will be especially effective once the government brings measures to slowly reopen the economy, which we can see happening now. And success for us is not how many SMEs we can bring on board, but how much we can help them get back, up and running. Not only will this help them now, but also will greatly expand their business. By selling online, they can get to reach customers all over Nepal.
By the way, how is Daraz coping with the current situation in terms of its day-to-day operations?
We have completely reworked our strategy. In order to support the government lockdown, we have been focusing entirely on the delivery of grocery and basic essentials in partnership with Big Mart. Prior to the lockdown, we had already taken a lot of precautions to ensure the safety of our customers and our staff. Since the lockdown, we have enforced 100% home-office policy to ensure the safety of our staff. All our delivery riders are regularly educated on hygienic best practices and are also equipped with hand sanitiser for them as well as for our customers. We are also constantly monitoring their health, and if anyone is not feeling well, they are told to strictly take rest at home. We are following the best practices from our Alibaba headquarters, the WHO and the local authorities for operations.
Please tell us about your collaboration with Big Mart.  
We were already in works of officially collaborating with Big Mart from months before. Big Mart is one of Nepal’s leading supermarket chains and it has an excellent supply chain. So, it was inevitable for us to partner with them, and it certainly helped us to be able fulfill the needs of our customers in this difficult time.
Finally, where do you see the future of e-commerce in Nepal?
This pandemic introduced many to online shopping for the first time. However, even in recent months, we have seen very strong growth rates in terms of e-commerce adoption and more and more people across the country are now aware of the convenience and benefits of online shopping. The increasing number of online shopping platforms, especially in the lockdown, underlines this development. Even the government started initiatives in this regard, and, therefore, we are very optimistic that the ecosystem will continue to strive strongly in the months and years to come.",-,"Thu, 14 May 2020 04:32:51 +0000"

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/violence-against-women-along-with-covid-19-another-crisis-is-taking-place-in-nepal.html,"
As the world is going through a pandemic, many countries, including Nepal, are under lockdowns after the rise in Covid-19 cases. During this humanitarian crisis, sadly, another crisis of violence against women is happening.
Violence against women and girls is one of the most prevalent human rights violations in the world. Globally, it is estimated that one in three women experience physical or sexual abuse in her lifetime. In the context of Nepal, violence against women is highly prevalent due to existing deep-rooted patriarchy and gender roles. Violence against women in Nepal during the lockdown has seen an upsurge. Women Rehabilitation Center (WOREC) documented 624 cases of violence against women and girls from 55 districts during the lockdown.
Due to existing patriarchal social structures in Nepal, women are marginalised from decision-making positions in social, economic, and legal sectors, rendering them vulnerable. They are at a high risk of sexual assault and exploitation every day and the risk is even higher during any crisis.  During this lockdown too, women are being physically and psychologically exploited as many women find themselves forced to be confined and isolated with domestic abusers; isolation is generally used by many perpetrators as a tool of control; conditions created by the pandemic is a perfect opportunity for domestic abuse to flourish.

The current circumstances make reporting even harder, due to limitations on women’s and girls’ access to phones, and disrupted public services like police, justice systems and social workers. These disruptions may also be compromising the care and support that survivors need, like clinical management of rape, and mental health and psychosocial support. They also fuel impunity for the perpetrators. Most sadly, the survivors cannot seek support as movement is restricted and/or the abusers are from their family. The consequences include serious physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems, including sexually transmitted infections like HIV and unplanned pregnancies. Reports suggest low help-seeking behaviours and low incident reporting among survivors.
The government of  Nepal planned to provide essential GBV prevention and response-related health and social services including psychosocial counselling, female-friendly spaces and shelters and strengthen referral pathways and scale up remote modalities to address GBV cases, such as hotlines and mobile counselling services, with training for frontline workers in collaboration with different I/NGOs during this pandemic situation. Additionally, the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens also developed an action plan to address the problems facing women, children, differently-abled persons and senior citizens during the Covid-19 pandemic, with an objective of providing emergency services to women, children, differently-abled persons and senior citizens; preventing potential violence and discrimination against them.
Along with this, different organisations such as Nepal Red Cross Society, Asha Crisis Centre, Transcultural Psychosocial Organisation (TPO), WOREC and National Women Commission are operating helpline services and offering counselling, legal services, therapy sessions through phone calls and social media for domestic violence survivors.  However, due to the absence of a mechanism to appropriately address violence against women and girls, their vulnerability to both pandemic and violence has increased.
Representational image
Crucial and safety nets such as effective helplines, psychosocial support and online counselling should reach to the unreached, using technology-based solutions such as SMS, online tools and networks to expand social support and to reach women with no access to phones or the internet. The information regarding counselling and legal services needs to be advertised widely at all media platforms including social media platforms, electronic and print media, public messaging at supermarkets, pharmacies and other appropriate areas so that information can reach out to the grassroots. Other priorities include a more responsive and gender-sensitive police force and procedure to help women and girls vulnerable to abuse in order to triumph over the immediate and long-term impact of this crisis.
The government must create an enabling and safe environment to access essential services, response plans and strategies to deal with violence against women during the Covid-19 crisis. Also, for the sustainable solution of the issues related to violence against women, the root cause—patriarchy—must be addressed. It is necessary to bring systematic changes. Social institutions such as education, politics, media, religion, judiciary system and political system are required to be gender-sensitive. Otherwise, it is hard to address consistent abuse and violence against women.

In some provinces, the search for an appropriate location is still underway whereas other provinces are also yet to undergo environmental impact assessments among other issues.

“Though the decision has not been implemented,” Subas Sitaula, the general manager of Industrial District Management Limited, says, “But, efforts such as studying these issues have been moved forward. The process to implement the decision is still ongoing.”
In Jhapa, for example, the government has already acquired 1,600 bigahas (10.83 square km) of land to establish the estate. Likewise, an agreement to jointly invest Rs 64 billion has been signed between Nepal and China, he informs. The government is preparing to acquire 5,000 bigahas of land in Sarlahi, but it has not been announced yet. “We, however, have begun preparing a detailed project report,” according to Sitaula.
In Province 5, however, local community forests have obstructed the land acquisition process whereas, in Karnali, the government is struggling hard to find an appropriate area. The Ministry of Forests and Environment has not approved the environmental impact assessment for the project in Gandaki.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/my-family-farm-why-other-youth-should-adopt-this-model-for-peace-prosperity.html,"
Family farming has been an integral part of our life. Being a farmer is not a job, but it is a way of life. My parents grew up working on farms and spent half of their life working for nature conservation. My father recognises plants and animal species very well, which also supports my academic career. He has dreamed of planting trees at a large scale as a private forest by the end of 2020.
But, the new generation today is always connected to social media but detached from nature and environment although some conservation initiatives and awareness programmes have been adopted globally. They need to realise that a time spent on a family farm is never wasted as it safeguards environmental assets, biodiversity and ecosystem which contributes to achieving Sustainable Development Goals.
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations defines a family farm as a farm that relies primarily on family members for labour and management. It has profound impacts on socio-economic, environmental and cultural sectors across the globe, improving food security.  My small family farm is surrounded by big concrete buildings on every side, and it is located near a busy market.
Basically, it has four major functions. Environmentally, it plays a vital role in water purification, carbon sequestration, soil fertility, pollination, fresh oxygen, and biodiversity enhancement. It ensures the peace of mind and self-satisfaction through peaceful nature.
Economically, it decreases bills of market goods, ensures business ownership, and makes the families independent. It supports the way of living through job opportunities.
Sociologically, it is connected with family values and makes society responsible through services. It is a part of survival for society as it provides food and fibre that nourish and sustain us.
Culturally, it preserves traditional norms and beliefs, religious values and territories.
Overall, it contributes to local, provincial and national markets in terms of providing healthy food and minimising trade deficit.

Over the past few years, open areas in the surroundings have changed almost into unmanaged houses and plotted lands for sale, which has a significant negative impact on farming. Human behaviours have changed with the flow of time. A few big trees near my house, where birds used to sing and build nests, have been cut off and are changed into modern furniture. The cool and fresh oxygen from trees has been replaced by smoke produced by brick kilns near the settlement area. The river where I used to go fishing and swimming is now narrowed with polluted water flowing in it. The number of fish, frogs, lizards, butterflies, dragonflies, and more species have declined dramatically within a short span. Forest areas have been encroached by locals for settlement and agriculture purposes. Overpopulation and haphazard urbanisation have become serious issues. Everything has changed in front of my naked eyes, but my family farm has remained constant.
In my farm, various tree species have become the habitat of birds. In the past three months, I have seen 23 bird species in two nests there. The farm is managed in such a way that insects, pollinators, birds, and small wild animals can find food and shelter. A few goats, chickens and ducks are also parts of my farm, which play a vital role to convert waste into compost.

We generally reuse and recycle about 70% of the waste at home.  For instance, the remaining food products like vegetables, fruits and by-products of vegetation are utilised by goats. Plastic bags and bottles are re-used. My mother is strict in the case of reusing the materials, plastic bags and bottles in particular. The remaining glass and electrical items are sent to disposal sites through the municipal system.
Personally, I feel self-employed with job satisfaction and subjective well being when it comes to family farming. A feeling of spiritual harmony and happiness circulates throughout my body when I spend time on the farm picking some vegetables and fruits despite a few difficulties. Moreover, chirping of birds is something that pleases me in the early hours of a day. It makes me feel that I am closer to nature and makes my day positive. The morning breezes from the northern side and songs of the birds make a perfect time to start a day. The birds are amazing creatures on the earth and I find them absolutely graceful.
The farm is just a small one that does not contribute to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) but definitely contributes to decreasing imports from India. It has livestock, vegetables, fruits and cereal crops. The production is mainly for home consumption; it is dependent on seasons and weather conditions. If farming is considered seriously and it is adopted at a large scale, our country will be independent in terms of food security and can recover from a negative trade balance in food products.

Thousands of Nepali migrant workers are expected to return to Nepal from their working countries due to the Covid-19 crisis. It will increase the employment crisis, causing stress in people and pushing them towards poverty. Over 1,000 cases of suicide have already been reported during the lockdown, apparently due to anxiety, depression, fear, financial problems and more. All things considered, a family farm like mine can be one of the solutions in returning to the normal life contributing to the idea of prosperous Nepal and happy Nepalis. Local governments should promote such initiatives, for example, by ensuring access to market and operational freedom. Policies must support and encourage the increase in farmers’ access to productive resources, land and capital in particular. Then, we, youth, are always ready to start enterprises and make our country independent in terms of food security.

Concerned officials of the two sides have agreed to let the traders of other sides pass the border after the rate of coronavirus infection decreases, it has been learned.",-,"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 06:02:00 +0000"

Kathmandu, July 6
The standing committee meeting of the ruling Nepal Communist Party has been deferred until Wednesday as two rival factions in the party are yet to find out any consensus regarding the leadership of the party and the government.
Recently, a majority of the standing committee including chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal has demanded that another chairman of the party, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, resign from both the positions of the PM and the party chair whereas Oli is adamant against the demand. The deadlock has led many to fear if the party, formed after the merger of the then CPN-UML and the CPN-Maoist Centre led by KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal respectively in 2018, would split again.
As the differences continued to escalate, the party leadership has halted the ongoing standing committee and the two chairmen are in conversation. They held a two-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, agreeing to find consensus by Monday morning before the scheduled standing committee meeting. However, the meeting has been postponed as an agreeable situation is yet to be found, it has been learned.
The meeting will take place at 11 am on Wednesday now, according to Oli’s aide, Surya Thapa.",-,"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 04:57:33 +0000"

As thousands of Nepalis working abroad prepare to return home due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Nepal faces the challenge of providing jobs to them. The country, which is dependent on agriculture, could attract young people, especially those returning home, to farming, experts say. However, it is necessary to bring in technological advances to the sector so that young people are attracted to it.
While Nepal has been focusing on mechanisation and reforms in agriculture with the aim of doubling its productivity in 10 years, these measures will not be adequate to meet its goals, says a Nepali coauthor of a recent paper titled ‘Innovation can accelerate the transition towards a sustainable food system’.
“When it comes to technology, we do not have to reinvent the wheel,” says Prajal Pradhan, a researcher at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Germany. “There are certain technologies such as vertical and terrace farming, and urban gardening that are already available,” he adds.
The paper published by an international team of researchers in the journal Nature Food investigates 75 emerging technologies and identifies highly promising innovations that have the potential to collectively transform the food system. The innovations deal with the entire food value chain from production and processing to consumption and waste management such as artificial meat, 3D printing, drones for managing agriculture, and innovations in urban production, such as ‘high-tech’ vertical farming in cities.
The paper notes that the future of human food systems will largely depend on the use of technology to make incremental improvements in existing food systems. However, these incremental improvements will not be enough to make global food systems capable of feeding the world’s growing population in a sustainable way. It calls for a radical transformation of the food system not just to feed the growing population, but also to achieve Sustainable Development Goals and targets set by the Paris Agreement on climate change.

“Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and meeting the Paris climate targets pose daunting challenges. To make substantial progress towards attaining these goals in the coming years, we must consider major changes in the way we produce and consume food,” says Mario Herrero, the lead author of the study and Chief Research Scientist at CSIRO.
Johan Rockström, PIK director and co-author of the study, says, “The Paris Agreement, together with UN’s 2030 goals of eradicating hunger, gives us the clear direction of where we are going.”
“This research now shows us not only how to get there, but also provides confidence that it is indeed possible to succeed. We can feed humanity within planetary boundaries: what we need is to prepare the ground by implementing the right policies for sustainable innovators and actors that can scale change in the entire food industry, such as carbon and nitrogen pricing and science-based targets for sustainable food,” he says. “Thus, we can kick-start a true transformation towards a safe and just food future for all on Earth.”
In the context of Nepal, following the liberalisation of trade in the 1990s, people are getting more food than before. “But, if we look at data from other South Asian countries, we can see that our agricultural productivity is low,” says Pradhan. “It is clear that the government cannot meet its target of doubling the productivity by 10 years if we are to continue in our current trajectory,” he says.
When it comes to the steps needed to adopt technology to boost agricultural production, the paper provides an eight-stop framework. “The framework could also be applicable for Nepal,” Pradhan informs. “The first thing that needs to be done is trust-building among different stakeholders and change in the mindset of policymakers and implementing agencies,” he adds. Social engagements also need to increase.",-,"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 04:35:47 +0000"

The Ministry of Home Affairs has ordered Nepal Police to arrest people who are seen outside their houses without wearing masks.
The ministry says the risk of coronavirus infection has not decreased yet though the lockdown imposed to control the outbreak has been partially relaxed.
As the lockdown was eased last month, the human movement has increased in urban areas, posing everyone at the risk of infection. Therefore, the order has been made to arrest them and take action as per the Infectious Disease Act, 1964, according to the ministry’s information officer Uma Kanta Adhikari.

Police in Dhanusha, a southeastern district of Nepal, have arrested an Indian national on the charge of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl.
The seminaked body of the child from Kurtha, Janakpur-21, was found around one kilometre away from her home, by the local Dudhmati stream, last Friday. The girl had left the house to graze her cattle.
Following the incident, the police arrested Dipu Singh, 32, from Malihabad, Uttar Pradesh. Rameshwar Karki, the District Police Office spokesperson Rameshwar Karki, says Singh has already confessed to the crime.
Singh was working at a private factory located close to the stream. Investigators say he enticed the child into going with him with the allure of eating a mango and committed the crime on Thursday. Following that, he wrapped the victim’s body with a blanket and dumped it on the riverbank.",-,"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 07:21:28 +0000"
