Border dispute with India has dominated media headlines recently. India has committed cartographic aggression over few places (approximately 392 square km) of western Nepal. There have been demands to bring forth the agenda to the United Nations or the International Court of Justice.
Some analysts opine that this is the best opportunity to name and shame India internationally. Boldly doing this can help bring anticipated outcome, they say. Lest not, India, at no request, either listens Nepal or ceases to pose big-brother attitude plunging us into catch 22, they urge. Archive evinces that some cases regarding border disputes have been prosecuted for ICJ’s jurisdiction. Kenya Vs Somalia (2012), Libya Vs Chad (1990), Belize and Guatemala (2008), Nicaragua Vs Republic of Honduras (1999), Niger Vs Burkina Faso (2013) are some to worrisomely catch wider attention. Ergo, following the same over recently tailored dispute may have been assumed as an obsessed priority.
Nonetheless, every popular issue won’t be always rational too. Famous scholar Robin Sharma on his book ‘Who will Cry When You Die’ alarms people to muse many times before speaking or taking any action. The advice elegantly fits here as worthy reference for umpteen reasons.
Dispute should not be hurriedly and hastily internationalized. No heavy dose of heartlessness and uncomfortable highhandedness should be forged. We should wait on trying with other modest methods of negotiation and mutual dialogue on noble cause of settling the ruffle with consent, confidence and complacency of each other. At least a dozen of strong basis understandably tender the ground to assimilate that we ought not to be much hyped and awkwardly mired at taking it on the global front.
Not Good at All
First, this is an opportunity to present prudence and prowess of resolving the issue ourselves. Doing so makes our prestige high in international level as well as ensures an accruing psychological satisfaction among citizen as well. But pushing it on court of International Court proves us incapable and having no calibre to address the ruffle self. This move unfolds our incapacity and inaction needed for the moot. Book titled ‘Border and Territorial Disputes’ by Judith Day and Allan Bell regards self-served approach as the best and beautiful method to heal such a deal.
Second, the maps presented from our sides are so controversial that not any standard and uniformed evidence is ready. From 1816 to 2016, much asymmetric maps are sketched and published regarding borders. On which basis shall we file a petition and solicit jurisdiction? It may enervate our legal ground.
Third, India has clearly expressed repudiation and extended statement of denial to face ICJ on border dispute. So, no any border confrontation of India with other nations shall be subject of hearing in ICJ as India has yet not been signatory for such provision.
Forth, there shall be easy access to the third party to have overarching presence and manipulation over Nepal. It avails ground for many international agencies, panels, forces and forums come to Nepal, take space and make stronghold on Nepal and its land to use us for their purpose. Then, we ought to cost to negotiate and face their micro-management at every deal.
Fifth, it debunks highly touted pragmatic legal system. Oriental civilization and resolution methods noticeably rely on modus operandi of arbitration but not on litigation system of justice as given heightened priority these days. Internationalizing it makes a side winner thus places us in endless rivalry and hostility. Lifelong angularities and enmity will be cultivated, feeling of revenges arises. Century long harmony and pact get destroyed over the night.
Sixth, it is foundational necessity that both countries should have negotiated often and have failed to reach to an undeniably agreeable resolution in order to internationalize any issue. The condition is never so and India has expressed repeated readiness to sit for dialogue. Even the recent response from India over our government’s note reconfirms the counter-side’s willingness.
Seventh, there has been nil work to raise Nepalese sentiment among the residents of said encroached zone. How does their emotion count once resolution takes on? Provided the body to settle the ruffle decides to care and count the views of denizens on the disputed land, will that make any weight on our side?
Eighth, decision of ICJ will be advisory, not obligatory and binding. The procedure is so lengthy, complex and technically uphill task that we can hardly afford financially, administratively and legally while mooting.
Ninth, taking the ruffle on global front lets us have promotion, but not necessarily the desired result. Do we look for upshot or mere a promotion? Let’s not overlook the reality.
Tenth, big-power nation will have big-power alliance. Goat hordes for goat, and so does a sheep. Most of ICJ members and bench fellow may support to and incline at side of super power. There may be many other points of power to manipulate the decision.
Eleventh, it hampers the harmony, foils the fabric of society, trade and vector of life for mass. Nepal is heavily relying on India on every micro to macro level need i.e. 90 percent of international trade and 80 plus percent import is from her and rest comes through her. About 2 million Nepalese are in short-term seasonal employment in India. Any irrational and hasty step may annoy a lot tending to cause larger harms.
Twelfth, being hurried to internationalize it, India will seldom have moral pressure and ethical obligation to proactively resolve issue in amicable manner. Rather, it may try to lobby and manipulate international community thus may earn relatively larger leverage and stronghold to granulate us. Therefore, let’s not wage suicidal scandal but wisely act ahead!

Way-out ahead
We should try to sit in dialogue, appeal through every means. We should take Indian apparatus like university people, students, entrepreneurs and lawyers to request and pressure their government to not harm, hurt and hegemonize over Nepal. Besides G2G, other channels like E2E and P2P may pivotally work. Track 2 diplomacy can be enormously instrumental.
India being global power should take neighbours in confidence and company. This step might sufficiently discourage neighbouring nations endorse the motion positively when India tailors its candidacy in the UN Security Council. Owing to these facts, if we raise issue confidently and soberly, India may present lenient enough readiness to resolve the ruffle through gentle-men assembly and efforts.
Many such disputes are resolved through diplomatic dialogue. And still, being passionate enough to engage into very method shall credit us with output as needed. Various researches chart a data that among approximately 150 such disputes, more than 95 percent are bilaterally settled. We should mainstream ourselves as well.
Better and beneficial negotiation, as soft power trick in lieu with Joseph S Nye on his landmark piece ‘Soft Power: A Means to Control the World Politics’, credits us capaciously. Let’s try honest and humble bi-lateral means. Riding through other ways may turn to be harsh and harmful as well.

When Ugra Karma made the first-ever Nepali metal recording, they didn’t intend to start a subculture. They just wanted to make life easier for themselves. “When we started to do shows,” says guitarist Prateek Raj Neupane, “our playing skills were at an amateur level. And the instruments we had were amateurish. And the sound didn’t come out good. We couldn’t explain what we wanted to sound engineers at shows, so we thought maybe we should do a record and give it to them so they could fix our sound. And that’s how we ended up recording the first-ever metal record in Nepal.”
That was in 2000 and the recording – the magnificently titled demo Himalayan Metal of Death, featuring a song called Perversion or Cutting Up of a Human Body & Eating Some of It – wasn’t made for general release. “We were thinking about bringing out three copies only, for the three people who recorded it. We would lend one to sound engineers at gigs. But our friends were adamant on us at least making 100 copies. We brought one of our friends’ father’s office printers to my home, made our own design and printed it.” The Nepali metal underground was born.
Back then, it was so underground that Ugra Karma, who were without a drummer, couldn’t even explain what death metal was to whoever filled in on the drum stool. “We would ask, ‘Do you play double bass drums?’” That’s the high-speed pummelling that powers death metal along. “They would tell us something like that didn’t even exist. So we switched instruments between songs. In one, I would do guitar and vocals, my friend would do bass, the other would do drums. But because we are not real drummers, we would get tired, so then I would go to drums and the other one would go to guitars. And then switch again.”
In truth, all metal in Nepal is still underground. This is one of the world’s poorest countries – ranked in the bottom quarter in the world for GDP per capita – and subject to political instability. The country was still recovering from a 10-year civil war that ended in 2006 when it was devastated by an earthquake in 2015. Corruption is endemic and the combination of denim, leather and long hair is still viewed with suspicion. Its music industry hasn’t the slightest interest in metal, which means everything has to be DIY.
For years, the police would pick up metal fans and cut off their long hair. Everyone mentions this as if it were a perfectly everyday thing. While that has stopped, the metal community still doesn’t have it easy: being a metalhead requires a level of commitment unknown in the west. “Recently, I was in jail for 15 days for putting on a thrash fest,” says Vishal Rai, who founded the Extreme Underground Metal Society of Nepal, which organises shows in the country. “Cops arrived in a van and said, ‘What kind of a noise is this?’ They took me in and charged me under noise pollution. I was kept inside for 15 days. This was a few months back. I am still on parole.”
This is the world in which the eighth edition of Silence festival exists. Nepal’s biggest metal event, established by Bikrant Shestra of the band Underside, is tiny by western standards: it takes place in two courtyards of a small hotel and restaurant complex in Kathmandu. But for Nepali metal, to have 1,500 or so fans in one place to watch a succession of bands across two stages one Saturday in mid-December is huge.
There are local groups – the excellent stoner rock trio Shree 3; Born in Silence, who owe such a debt (visually and sonically) to one particular band that they might as well be called KnotSlip; grindcore band Chepang, who have three singers, two drummers and no bassist; Prateek’s other death metal band, Binaash; and Underside themselves. There are bands from around Asia. And there is a big-name headliner: Californian thrash veterans Testament.
The day before Silence, though, there’s a sense of nervousness. It has been raining hard in Kathmandu, which means the site isn’t ready. Driving round the city, the surrounding mountains hidden from view by the lowering clouds and the traffic jostling on rutted and puddled roads, it’s hard to imagine how anyone could make a festival work here. And, as Underside’s singer Avishek KC explains, Nepal has a pay-on-the-day culture, and if the rain stays, the fans won’t come. What’s more, Testament’s fee alone accounts for more than the ticket revenue a sold-out event will bring, a situation made more worrying by the fact that one of the biggest sponsors has halved its funding. Worse still, Underside – the most popular metal band in Nepal – can’t even play their own festival: their drummer lives in Assam, in India, and can’t leave his girlfriend’s home because of the civil unrest there. There is gunfire outside the house and flights have been suspended.
Silence is clearly not going to make its organisers rich. Festival director Flower KC, who also manages Underside, reckons this one will lose £25,000, all covered by him and his friends. “The idea is guided by the idea that why should it be only mountaineers or hippies who come to Nepal?” Flower says. “Why can’t we attract a different breed of people? My goal is to make Nepal a heavy metal destination. Testament came to play purely because it was in Kathmandu – I hung out with them and they were stoked to be here.
“Fast forward 10 to 15 years, my dream is that our festival makes music fans want to travel to Nepal to see the sickest bands.” But he needs international sponsorship. “We don’t have infinite money, and sponsorship games are pretty weird in this country.”
While the people who run the festival might be middle-class by Nepali standards, they are not in western terms – all the Nepali metal musicians have other jobs. Prateek plays guitar in two bands, teaches leadership to management students in college, and acts in Nepali movies; Flower, who lives in the UK, works in local government in London.
Money matters here. “If you want to see real Nepal, you have to step out of the city,” Avishek says. “And people in the villages – until two years ago, you had all these power cut-offs, 18 hours a day without power. So people didn’t even have a choice to listen to music.” Prateek adds: “Working class here means something very different from England. They are so busy trying to get food and shelter for today that they do not have the luxury to come to gigs and listen to music and, in their terms, waste time.”
Being middle class, and having other avenues open to them, few metal bands last long – and fans don’t tend to stick with the scene far into their 20s. “They will regularly follow metal up to college,” says Vishal Rai. “But after college, they will get pressure from society and family to find a job. After college, they mostly follow a different lifestyle. But there are a few people who always stick to metal, like me. I’m very old to be into this stuff – I am 35.”
Having such a young scene is healthy in some ways, Prateek says. There are always young bands and fresh fans coming along. But because the scene is so young, no one has their own money, which means ticket prices have stayed low for 20 years, making it impossible for bands to even cover their costs.
“Make the tickets expensive,” he says. “Forget that 100 rupee [£1] bullshit. Make it 1,000. People need to learn that gigs are expensive. And there is a reason for that. If you hire a sound system, it will cost you. The venue will charge you. The venue gets paid, the sound system gets paid. But the bands – who are the core of the show, who the people come to see – aren’t paid.” Avishek notes that Underside, who can draw 800 people in Kathmandu, charged an unprecedented price for their last headline show: 500 rupees. A fiver, in British money.
Despite overnight storms, Saturday dawns clear. In the early morning, women are at the city’s wells, taking advantage of the good weather to get their washing done. Worshippers are making their clockwise walks around the roadside shrines that dot the city. And at the festival site, volunteers, having been unable to work the previous day, frantically pull everything together. Silence kicks off just a few minutes late and the crowd swells as the afternoon wears on. The majority of fans are local, with a few Europeans and Americans. One Peace Corps worker, who has come in from out of town, is sporting a T-shirt from the recent Extreme Gore Fest III event. When he went in the pit there, he says, everyone fled because he was twice their height and they thought he’d crush them.
The whole thing is fabulous: supremely good-natured and cooperative. There are local oddities: instead of the battle jackets – sleeveless denim covered with patches beloved of western metalheads – a fair few of the fans have sewn a big patch on to the back of a piece of entirely unmetal clothing. I see a Napalm Death patch on the back of a plaid shirt, though I’m not sure the lad who has attached a Pantera patch to the back of his waterproof has done its weather-resistant qualities any good. Best of all, Underside get their moment of glory after all. On learning of their drummer-less state, Testament’s Gene Hoglan – a legend in thrash metal – volunteers to spend the afternoon learning four songs so they can play a short set. Avishek is almost shaking with excitement when he tells me. “Gene Hoglan is going to play with Underside! Gene fucking Hoglan!”
After night falls, Testament take to the stage, the biggest metal band ever to have come to Nepal. Their singer, Chuck Billy, surveys the crowd. He’s played to thousands of audiences, most bigger than this, but I’ve rarely seen a man look so delighted to be fronting a band. “How are you fucking doing?” he shouts, then pauses to laugh. “Kathmandu?” And he shakes his head in disbelief.

Freedom of speech, of political and social activities and of association are central norms of a democratic society. And morality is the cornerstone of any government in the world.
But Nepal government seems be frequently flouting these ideals. Media Council and Information Technology bill introduced by the government contains provisions to curtail basic rights of freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution. Whereas the Criminal Code of the nation has adequate laws to take actions against anyone found guilty in case of violation of law, this bill intends to subdue the voice of the public which often pours in the social media to criticise untoward government actions.
Along with it, the Government of Nepal has registered Nepal Special Service Bill at the National Assembly. The bill has a clear provision of surveilling or intercepting an individual. Clause 10 of the bill clearly states that audio or visual conversation of an individual or an institution can be monitored. If this bill gets passed, then it is obvious that personal freedom will be sabotaged.
This is in keeping with the world trend. Throughout the world, most of the governments intend to disregard dissent. People have been unable to express their dissenting voices, especially on government policies. It needs to be emphasised here that dissent is the other word for freedom of thought.
However, expressing dissent has become a far cry in democratic countries like India. The recent Citizenship Amendment Bill and the oppression of the protesters, the brutal attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University students who have been protesting fee hikes in the university, mainstream media shamelessly parroting government’s voices serve as examples of populist government causing harm to democratic values.
The value of democracy persists in diverse opinions. And it is a necessary catalytic agent to which society owes its progress. Without dissent society becomes stagnant and moribund.
Governments disregard dissent and at the same time value Machiavellian character of deceiving the public. Niccolo Machiavelli in his magnum opus The Prince (1517) portrays some of the essential quality for a leader. Deceit is one of those qualities.
Machiavellianism is a term used to describe a person’s tendency to deceive and manipulate others for personal gain. In simple terms, Machiavellianism implies that in the arena of power, the end justifies the means. Machiavelli opines that for a politician, power is the most important thing, morality be damned.
To know how a modern Machiavellian would look like, we can present the example of the main character Francis Underwood from the American web series, The House of Cards. He uses double crosses, blackmail, political stratagem, ruthlessness, murder and manipulation of media. Nothing stops him to rise to the topmost political position. He not only eschews the value of morality with his fellow party members but even with his wife.
Throughout the 73 episodes, this web series depicts the fact that morality in present politics has been eclipsed for power. The fictional world eerily reflects the real world. The recent phenomenon seen in the present world politics is the Sabbath of morality. Whatever helps one to achieve morality is politics and whatever helps to achieve the end is moral. But the question remains, can a democratic norm endure in the absence of moral values?  If we believe morality a bedrock of democracy, it definitely will not.
The majority government of Nepal by now must have realised that power–even unchallenged power–is not enough. And personal popularity and charisma are not enough to govern a country. Thumping electoral victories are not enough. For had it been so, the country’s condition would not have been what it is today.
The most important thing for the government to run efficiently is the support of the general people. How much a politician needs the support of its people is described in every chapter of The Prince. Government accumulates support of the people with smooth delivery.
Meanwhile, in Nepal, a stark contrast can be found in the promise made by the government during the election and the reality afterwards. Dollar promised, penny delivered!
A situation has arisen in the country where on the one hand a myriad of problems are begging for solutions while on the other a medley of policies have become contentious.
However, the government is found indulging on the matters like extending the lease for Gokarna Forest Resort before the expiry of the current lease period which still has six more years. It is reported that the prime minister has a personal interest in doing so.

Prior to this, the government was forced to scrap ‘Guthi‘ bill. The bill tried to nationalise centuries-old religious trusts of Newar community and deprive them of ownership, culminating in cultural encroachment. The government had to scrap the bill due to public outcry and accusation of narrowing civil space and freedom.
These are few examples that depict the deceiving quality of the government towards the general public.
For Machiavelli deceit counts as one of the qualities of the leaders. He says, “Promise given was a necessity of the past and the word broken is the necessity of the present.”
The scribe feels that like most of the politicians in the world, Nepali politicos are anointed with Machiavellian thought when it comes to deceiving people.  They would better read Machiavelli’s treatise in full as he clearly says that if the leadership fails to recognize, trust, value and encourage its citizens it will quickly lose the respect and support from the people.
Sycophants and apologists of the current regime may paint a rosy picture but impartial people see a dismal picture of the country with hardly any relieving features in the present leadership.

Zhou Li (not his real name) was glad he escaped Nepal before the big Christmas Eve police raid.
A couple of days before the Nepali cops detained 122 Chinese nationals Dec. 24 for suspected involvement in financial crimes, Zhou fled to China from an online gaming company where he worked for about two weeks in Katmandu, the Nepali capital.
The employer, whose name Zhou declined to disclose out of safety concerns, was not on the list for the raid, but it carries out the same deceptive scheme as those that were hit. These businesses are suspected of using social media to con wealthy single or divorced Chinese women out of money.
In an exclusive interview with Caixin, Zhou, from Yueyang in central China’s Hunan province, unveiled how an international fraud scheme played out.
Online chatting, air travel reimbursement, monthly salary of at least 10,000 yuan ($1,440) plus bonus. That was the offer that convinced Zhou, 23 and unemployed, and a friend to step on an airplane to Nepal. The friend said his relative worked at Amazon.com’s customer call center in Japan. Zhou said he thought the job in Nepal would be similar.
Upon arrival at Kathmandu airport, Zhou and his friend were picked up by a local contact and settled at a hotel tucked away in a secluded alley. According to the location Zhou provided, the hotel is close to Boudhanath Stupa, a popular tourist site on the northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu.
The company recently relocated from the Philippines because of tightened scrutiny by authorities. It leased more than 10 rooms from the hotel to house employees. Three to four employees shared a room, and there were many bugs in the rooms, Zhou said. The company used a vacant street-level retailing space at the hotel as its office.
Zhou was told employees had to be accompanied by designated personnel whenever they went outside the hotel for safety reasons.
On his first day at work, Zhou was given a used laptop computer, a used cell phone and a prepaid phone card. He was also given a training document, which he finished reading in about half an hour. The document taught new recruits how to compile a fake profile, introduce themselves and chat with women on dating websites.
Most often-picked professions include construction labor contractor, business partner, building material wholesaler and restaurant owner, Zhou said. They were instructed to target single or divorced women on Chinese dating websites and then lure them into spending money playing online gambling games designed by the company.
The employees were assigned different roles in the boiler room operation. Some were responsible for recruiting people from their hometowns; some screened potential clients on dating sites; and those who could type fast were assigned five targets a day. New recruits like Zhou were assigned two each day. Anyone who successfully attracted clients to spend money on the gambling games could get a 20% commission.
Zhou started his routine at 4 a.m. every day, including sending morning greetings to his targets. Usually he would tell them he just finished jogging or had a meeting to attend, to create an image of a successful and busy businessman. Around noon, he would text the targets asking them what they had for lunch.
The key strategy was to learn the targets’ interests and establish a bond with them, Zhou said. Some of his more skilled colleagues could chat with a dozen women online simultaneously. After gaining the targets’ trust, they would claim they had “inside information” and could help the targets win money in online gambling. After taking the bait, the players would win the first few games under the gaming company’s manipulation to lure them into betting more money.
Zhou heard that a colleague got a client to spend more than 800,000 yuan in two days. Most of the targets were women in their 40s and 50s who usually weren’t internet-savvy.
Southeast Asia bans drive companies to Nepal
Since the second half of 2019, many such online gambling companies, mostly operated by Chinese citizens, relocated to Nepal from Southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia and the Philippines, pushed out by a ban on online gambling by Cambodia and a halt in new licenses for online gaming in the Philippines.
Nepal has a relatively relaxed legal and business environment for casino and online gambling operators. The country also grants 90-day visas on arrival to Chinese citizens to attract foreign tourists, making it convenient for online gambling operators to recruit people from China.
Some local Chinese residents in Nepal told Caixin they noticed that many young Chinese men appeared in Kathmandu since September, claiming they were in e-commerce or internet businesses. They usually rented a big villa as their office and employee dormitory. Some local residents complained that these people drove up rents.
One of the main sites in December’s raid was an eight-story building on the northwest outskirts of Kathmandu. Local residents told Caixin that through windows they saw people working in front of computers. Not long before the arrest, the tenants spoke with the owner of a house across the street, offering 9,000 yuan a month, or four times the current rent.
The arrests were one of the biggest crackdowns on crime involving foreigners in the Himalayan country last year. But local residents said they think the raids hit only the tip of an iceberg. Nepali police said they are still closely monitoring about 800 suspected Chinese nationals.
“We could not catch most of them as they might have run away,” said Uttam Raj Subedi, chief of Nepal police in Kathmandu. “We are still on high alert.”
When Zhou told his boss his intention to quit, the company confiscated his passport and required that he pay back the flight ticket and his expenses in Nepal before returning it so he could leave. Zhou said he stole back his passport while others in the company were holding a party to welcome new recruits. He fled to the airport and took the cheapest flight back home, he said.

http://english.lokaantar.com/articles/indian-infringement-nepal-border-area/,"Ishaal Zehra
As Nepal prepares to fix a date for holding talks with India to resolve the border issue, the seriousness of resolve on Indian side and depth of the issue must be realized.
The history of demarcation of India-Nepal border began on March 4th, 1816, after the signing of the “Sugauli Treaty” between the then British India and the state of Nepal, which declares River Mahakali, of Nepal, as the border-line between both the countries. The Treaty was expected to resolve the border issues, but it did not. Even after such a long time, the dispute regarding the border and the no-man’s land area is being ensued now and then in different areas of Nepali border. The reason for the continuation of such dispute is that the rivers, counted on as border, diverged from their courses several times in the past. Interestingly, around 600 Km of the border is defined by rivers. Mechi in the East, Mahakali in the West and Naryani in the Susta area, and the unavailability of old maps and documents to revise demarcations has made the situation more significant. The Central government of India deputed its Para-military security guards of special services bureau (Shastra Seema Bal) along the border where as to counter guard the Nepali side of border-line, presence of Nepali security is almost nil!. Taking advantage of the ignorant attitude of Nepalese towards border guard, India started encroachment of the border land. She has said to encroach over 61,000 hectares in 26 of the bordering districts, by now. There has been a lot of hue and cry over the encroachment by Nepali people which unfortunately never fell on the deaf ears of the giant called India.
India surrounds Nepal from the East, West and South. There is a 1,808 km long border (September 2019 Wikipedia shows as 1,758 km)between Nepal and India, where out of 75 districts adjoining Indian territory,26 have been encroached, marking 71 areas of disputes altogether. The major ones include Kalapani- Limpiyahura, Susta, Mechi and Tanakpur. There is often found an opportunistic overtone in both countries regarding the ownership of such disputed border points. Hence, to resolve the issue, an India-Nepal Joint Technical Level Boundary Committee has been set up in motion which is still to find a reasonable solution for this false encroachment issue.
The encroachment by India started right after the Indo-Sino border war of November 1962. After facing defeat the Indian army set-up a camp inside Nepali’s territory at Kalapani to monitor the Chinese activities. But now they claim that the area belongs to them. However, reports prepared by Buddhi Narayan Shrestha, former director general of the Department of Survey Nepal, corroborates that the maps of 1850 and 1856 prepared by the Survey of India with the participation of Nepalese authority clearly states that the river originates from Limpiyadhura, 16 km North-West of Kalapani, which proves that Kalapani belongs to Nepal. But India refuses to accept those maps as proof. They say that the map prepared by them in 1875 should be considered as proof which shows river Mahakali origin is beyond Kalapani. Interestingly, the said map does not have Nepal’s certification.
The other disputed area situated in the East of Naryani River, is the Susta area, which is the tensest area owing to encroachment. Some time ago, over one thousand Indian villagers backed by Indian border police force (SSB) had forcibly entered the Nepali territory in Susta. They completely destroyed sugarcane in about ten hectares of land and also manhandled men and women. Where the locals of Susta complain such incidents are rampant in the area. The main reason behind the dispute is the changing course of Naryani River, over the past decades. The river has said to change its course towards the Nepalese side in the West. India has encroached about 14,500 hectares of the reclaimed land because of this. The intrusion happened in stages over a period of decades. According to reports, lands disputes among locals are usually won by Indian nationals who have the support of the armed Indian Border Police Force – the Seema Sashastra Bal. Considering the situation, the people of Nepal had launched a “save Susta campaign”. The organizers requested students of Nepal to join them and launch a valley wide campaign from Nepal’s capital Katmandu. The purpose of the campaign was to inform the world about the wicked plans of her “polite” neighbor India. Actually the reason to start off the border dispute at Susta side is that Susta is surrounded by Indian Territory on three sides -the North, South and East, and on the West it is the Naryani River. Hence, cutting off Susta from its mother land becomes much easier for India to occupy it which will pave her closer to the “Greater India” dream of Hindus.
The other most talked about point of dispute is Mechi. India’s disapproval of “Junge pillers” as the main boundary pillars has sparked the Mechi border dispute. The map published by the British India right after the Sauguli Treaty clearly indicates those pillars to be the main boundary pillars. Even history is evident that British had erected those pillars as monuments of Nepal-India border. But the credit goes to the Indian desire of getting control over weak and tiny neighbours which made her to incite the dispute by denying the original Sauguli Treaty signed by the British and the Nepal Kingdom.
According to the official records, Nepal covers a total area of 147,181 Sq Km. But in reality, the territory of Nepal is gradually shrinking because of the increasing encroachment by India. The Maoists Young Communist league (YCL) once submitted a memorandum to the Indian embassy Katmandu, demanding immediate return of the encroached land by the Indians in Susta area but later the political havoc in Nepal made everything go vanish for some time. They demanded that scientific demarcation of the border land must be done as per historical maps, the encroached territories should be given back to Nepal and the bilateral bordering area should be regulated. The district level of Nepal and India earlier agreed not to allow the use of encroached land for any purpose and put the issue at the central level for the resolution of the problem. But despite the agreement Indian farmers have been cultivating in the disputed area.

The Nepal-India joint Technical level Boundary Committee has supposed to have completed 97% of the task of strip-mapping the border, as per 1874 Persian map adopted by the committee. According to them all the disputes, except Susta and Kalapani, have been resolved. But when the border is traced in the field, many instances of encroachment are found. The unwisely decision of Nepalese side of accepting the Persian map as the basis of demarcation has made them deprived of 1630 hectares of their own land, which now lies in Indian territory. The border committee somehow, could not act the way it ought to. It failed to take firm decisions regarding border disputes at several places, such as the presence of Indian Paramilitary force in Kalapani since 1962.
India has many interests in Nepal to fulfill which it has gradually made her strong political, diplomatic, economic and cultural influence there, all due to RAW’s efforts. Her main strategy is to keep Nepal instable and always dependent towards India. In this regard, she has supported arms to the establishment as well as anti-establishment groups in Nepal, according to the former Prime Minister BP Koirala’s biography. India has a history for formulating efforts on multiple fronts to weaken the already fragile country to facilitate its swallowing. It is high time when all the Nepalese, currently divided among various political affiliations, should come together against the onslaught, instigated by India, in Nepalese territory and understand the game-plan of their hegemonic neighbor. And India also should realize that the flame she has ignited in Nepal can very well extend to its own northern flank and the unstable southern part as well. Keeping in mind the on-going protests in India on account of CAB and changed status of Kashmir and Ladakh, this possibility is too real and near both.

Forest is considered a great ornament of nature. The role of family forest in biodiversity conservation and generating income is vital. In contemporary context, promoting family forest plays an important role for conserving forest covers. In Nepal, nature has provided great wealth in the form of the forest and there is high potential of promoting family forest for conserving wildlife and ecosystem. It also helps to generate income and employment.
For a long period of time, countries have been preserving and promoting family forest for tourist attraction, wildlife conservation and for fun. Take the US. The Americans have given the responsibility of preserving and promoting family forest to the new generation and the term “generation for forest” is popular. The main objectives of this programme are managing home forest for income generation and to realise the importance of greenery and peace for the next generation.
The situation in Nepal, however, is different. Due to low income and lack of awareness among farmers, the importance of forest is not fully realised and recognised. But Nepali people have been preserving the forest from ancient times. The process of preserving forests is continuously gaining momentum.
If Forest Act 2018 is effectively implemented it will generate hope for farmers and uplift their life economically. According to Pitambar Sigdel, General Secretary at Association of Family Forest Owners Nepal (AFFON), the new Act regarding the forest has significantly increased hopes and enthusiasm among the farmers connected with family forest. In rural areas, people’s livelihood directly depends on the forest but due to the lack of effective policies and awareness farmers associated with home forest are unable to motivate and encourage new generation for preserving and managing family forest.
The major problem of farmers is that they are deprived of the benefit and advantage of utilising family forest. Nepal is rich in natural herbs and Ayurvedic herbs which can be economically beneficial to the locals. But due to lack of knowledge and guidance they are unable to take benefits from it. Most of the developed countries like the US, Canada and Denmark are highly preserving the family forest and farmers have benefited by utilising the forest. Unfortunately, in our country farmers have been unable to utilise the family forest for economic benefit.
According to the new Act, policy-specific priority has been given to the farmers who can utilise forest for their economic gains. The new law has made a provision for easy selling and utilisation of family forest for betterment of farmers and to lift them economically. So, farmers should be encouraged to cultivate plants that will grow faster so that they do not have to wait for a long time to get the economic benefit from the forest. According to the new Act, Nepal has given positive hope for providing security to family forest owners and increasing their access to local resources.

After the new policy of the government regarding forest in places like Butwal, farmers are excited about growing forest. As family forest contributes to conservation of biodiversity and can play a greater role to sequestrate carbon from the atmosphere. Similarly, family forest can generate income and employment opportunities; thereby helping in improvement of the livelihood of the people. So, it is very important to support the farmers, encourage them and provide necessary training so that they can effectively produce the forest and also be able to get the economic benefit from it.
Similarly, government should develop easy process for registering the family forest which must be done through the local ward office. It will help farmers to register without procedural hurdles. Further, all the required permissions related to harvest, use and transportation of the family forest product should be given by the ward offices. Family forest should be considered as agricultural crops and there should not be prohibition in cutting and selling of trees from family forest areas. Process for selling and cultivating trees can ensure economic benefit for the farmers.

Last year, when Raju Basnet was covering landgrabs in the Nepali city of Lalitpur, he knew he was playing with fire. His reports in the weekly Khojtalas alleged that powerful people, including government officials, were involved in the scheme and Basnet had already received multiple warnings to back off the story. Despite this, Basnet told me when we met in his small, makeshift office on the edge of Kathmandu, he never thought he would be arrested.
However, the day after he republished another outlet’s story on the same issue on his website, authorities detained Basnet for five days under the Electronic Transactions Act, a law purportedly designed to fight cybercrime, but which journalists say is used against reporters who share news or commentary on social media and websites.
“The environment is not journalist friendly,” Basnet said. “The situation is critical now.”
It was a sentiment shared by many of the journalists with whom I met in Kathmandu in October. While they acknowledged that generally the climate had improved since restrictions imposed under the monarchy and later the Maoist insurgency in the 1990s and early 2000s, in the past two years authorities have chipped away at the guarantee of “complete press freedom” included in the new 2015 constitution.
The K.P. Sharma Oli-led Communist Party of Nepal government has proposed several pieces of legislation that undermine the rights laid out in the constitution. Three proposed bills—the Media Council Bill, which recommends reforms to the semi-autonomous Press Council; the Advertisement Regulation Bill, which would make publishers accountable for content in advertisements; and the Information Technology Bill—were flagged as having a negative impact on the press.
Alongside new regulations, journalists spoke of pressure from officials and embassies to censor reporting, reduced access and transparency, and caution when reporting on privately owned companies who provide a large part of the news industry’s advertising revenue.
“With the new constitution we thought we had protection, but again we have to fight for democracy,” Guna Raj Luitel, editor of the Nepali-language daily Nagarik, told me.
The government has argued that it needs the bills to deal with misinformation and hate speech, and to improve the media environment. But the general sentiment among the press is that these proposals are motivated by a desire to prevent criticism and dissent. Journalists told me that if the proposals were passed in their present form, it would be the greatest threat to journalism in the country in years.
“The government is trying to propose several acts that infringe upon the constitution,” Prakash Rimal, editor of the English-language daily The Himalayan Times, told me. “They walk different paths, all of which lead to the curtailing of press freedom … [and] will only encourage censorship or self-censorship.”
In a phone interview in late December, Nepal’s minister of communication and information technology, Gokul Baskota, said that the proposals were “based on the constitution” and that any suggestion they could be used against journalists was “fake.” Baskota said, “We have never made anti-freedom press laws.” He added that some provisions were created to tackle crimes on social media, not mainstream media.
Press freedom restricted
The curtailment of press freedom began in 2017, when the Constituent Assembly passed the criminal code. When it came into effect the following year, CPJ voiced alarm over provisions that threatened public interest journalism. A government-formed committee suggested amendments but those proposals have not been honored, said Govinda Acharya, president of the Federation of Nepali Journalists. The local press freedom advocacy group was included in the committee.
While nearly every journalist I spoke with said that the Press Council was in need of reform, most said the bill they were concerned about most was the Media Council Bill. The proposal, introduced to Parliament in May, would amend the Press Council and bring it under further government control, as well as giving it power to impose fines for damaging a person’s reputation. The bill was brought forward without stakeholder input, circumventing the typical process in a move that caused outcry from journalists across the country. The Federation of Nepali Journalists submitted a number of proposed amendments, which the government has said will be discussed at the next National Assembly session.
When we spoke in December, Baskota said the pieces of legislation were still being debated and were following the democratic process.
Under the Advertisement Regulation Bill, owners and publishers of media outlets could be held responsible for the contents of advertisements. The proposal includes stipulations for a fine of 10,000 Nepali rupees (US$90) and up to one year in jail for publishing content deemed offensive, false or confidential, according to the Himalayan Times.
Taranath Dahal, director of the local non-governmental organization Freedom Forum, said “I haven’t seen anything like this in a democratic country.” As of late December, the bill was with the National Assembly for approval, after the lower house endorsed it.
The Information Technology Bill would essentially repackage the existing Electronic Transactions Act, under which several journalists, including Basnet, were jailed. Nepal has faced major hacking incidents recently, so it does need a cyber-crime law, but not this kind, Babita Basnet, editor of the weekly Ghatana Ra Bichar, and no relation to Raju Basnet, told me over tea on a rainy afternoon.
Babita Basnet pointed to the case of Pranesh Gautam, a comedian who was jailed for nine days under the Electronic Transactions Act in June, for critiquing a film on “Meme Nepal,” his YouTube channel. “Before, even our brothers and sisters used to post jokes, criticizing the government. Now they’re not posting,” she said. “The fear is already there among the general people.”
Narayan Wagle, a senior journalist and former editor of the newspapers Kantipur and Nagarik, said, “If you allow police to interpret the act in their own way, the press will suffer.” Wagle added “The IT Bill will give police more authority, it equips them legally, making them more powerful so that the press behave.”
Numerous bills are being passed at provincial levels too, including the Radio Operation and Management Act of Province No. 1, which included provisions for imprisoning journalists for their work, before the Federation of Nepali Journalists lobbied successfully to have it removed, Acharya said.
Under pressure
Aside from restrictive legislation, editors in Kathmandu talked of how authorities and staff at some embassies applied pressure over stories that touched on transparency, development, or corruption. The editors said that while these phone calls were not overt threats, officials have called to ask questions about published reports and in some cases government supporters have called to criticize coverage.
Binod Dhungel, editor of the privately owned station Himalaya Television, and Babita Basnet both said that on average, they get calls once or twice a month. Rajesh KC, a cartoonist, said he also gets phone calls asking him why he is “anti-government.” He used to get similar calls during the king’s time and the Maoist conflict and said the motive was the same—the government does not want to be criticized.
Sanjeev Satgainya, a news editor at The Kathmandu Post, said that the government appeared to view any criticism as a ploy against it. “Anything critical is seen as destabilizing and a threat to democracy and the republican setup,” he said.
Anup Kaphle, editor of the English daily The Kathmandu Post, said staff in the Chinese embassy have called him and the publisher over coverage and that they were sensitive about stories on Tibet and the Dalai Lama.
Luitel, editor of Nagarik, said he had also received calls from staff at the Chinese embassy asking about the paper’s coverage on Hong Kong. Broadly speaking, Luitel said, the Nepali media shies away from issues considered sensitive in neighboring countries. “If you look at Kashmir or Tibet, it’s hardly touched,” he said. “Our government gets annoyed if we start reporting, we have been using wire stories.”
Nepal’s communication minister, Baskota denied there were attempts by the government to interfere with journalists.
China’s embassy in Nepal did not respond to CPJ’s request for comment.
There’s concern too about the influence of China and India on the Nepali government’s attitude toward the press, and the exporting of “Xi Jinping thought”—the Chinese president’s political philosophy that promotes the supremacy of the Communist Party. Deepak Adhikari, a freelance journalist, said the bills were a slide toward elected authoritarianism.
“[The government] praises Hun-Sen of Cambodia, they’re trying to be like China, when you hear things like that it’s worrying,” Kaphle, editor of The Kathmandu Post, said. “But they’ve also seen that it works … it’s working for Trump, it’s working for Erdoğan, it’s working for Modi.”
The journalists also talked about challenges in reporting on privately owned companies and businesses because of the risk of losing advertising revenue.
“We don’t do the digging that’s needed around the corporate world because they make such a big part of the advertisements and in Nepal the advertisement pie is really small,” Bhrikuti Rai, a reporter at The Kathmandu Post, said.
Luitel told me that if a news outlet reports critically on a company, the owners sometimes call the marketing department and withdraw advertising.
Ameet Dhakal, who runs Setopati, a news website funded entirely by advertising revenue, added, “I’m a little cautious not to kick too many doors at a time.”
CPJ/Aliya Iftikhar
Access denied
Diya Chand, editor of Sanchar Kendra, a small Nepali news website that often reports on the banned Communist Party of Nepal, led by Netra Bikram Chand, told me officials refused to renew her press card after she wrote about an incident in which police allegedly killed a member of the party. Officials told her they had been told to deny her request because she was creating problems for the government. After working with the Federation of Nepali Journalists, she was finally able to get the pass renewed.
“If we compare it to the conflict-era or insurgency, the situation is much better, but it seems the government wants journalists to write what the government wants,” Bimal Gautam, editor of the investigative website Lokaantar, told me. “Calls from different sources or officials, these are minor things, but the government is also trying to muffle dissenting opinions and trying to teach the principles of journalism.”
The government feels they’ve been written badly about, Rimal said, and is trying to enforce what it refers to as responsible journalism.
That’s certainly the line that Kishore Shrestha, the politically-appointed chair of the Press Council, appeared to be pushing when we met to discuss the current press freedom climate in Nepal. He began by saying, “The situation is still vulnerable. We have been given too much press freedom.”
The Press Council introduced a new code of conduct recently, which includes provisions to allow the council to monitor journalists’ social media accounts and take action against posts that it deems are not respectful.
Shrestha said the code of conduct was necessary because Nepal’s media did not have “quality control” and that the media should be “responsible and professional.” Shrestha said he has a duty not just to defend press freedom, but also readers who may have been victimized by journalists and hate speech.
The chair, who also works for the weekly tabloid Jana Aastha, said that he agreed with some of the criticism of the Electronic Transactions Act and the Media Council Bill, and that he would push for amendments.
Mohna Ansari, a lawyer and member of the independent National Human Rights Commission Nepal, said the code of conduct ascribed by the press council was hypocritical. “In the name of controlling hate speech, you can’t curtail freedom of expression,” she said.
Kosmos Biswokarma, editor of the news website Kathmandu Press, went further, describing it as “bullshit.” “Democracy doesn’t work like that,” he said. “Who gets to decide what responsible journalism is?”

The increasing incidents of rape, followed by the murder of the victim, have contributed to people raising voices for the death penalty of the culprit. Many citizens, politicians, and social activists have argued for hanging of the culprit till death. The horrific rape incident of a veterinary doctor in India and the rape incident of Nirmala Pant in Nepal has generated buzz for the demand of death penalty.
Death penalty is a debatable topic and the Nepali Constitution has explicitly abolished the capital punishment for any crime. Actually, death penalty is the highest form of punishment as it is an irrevocable sentence that takes the life of a human. There are many countries which still retain the provision of the death penalty but the number of convictions is very low.  The conviction under the death sentence is low as it violates human rights and there is no deterrent effect in society.
Death penalty is the violation of “due process of law”, “equal protection of law” and especially the prohibition against “cruel and unusual punishment.” It reduces the value of human life, respect for human life and also violates the offender’s right to life. Statistically, 58 countries still retain death penalty whereas 106 countries have abolished it holistically. Six countries have abolished it for ordinary crime and 32 have abolished it in practice. Countries like India, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China which cover 60 percent of the world’s population have retained the death penalty.
Capital punishment follows the retributive theory of justice which doesn’t allow the criminal to get a chance of rehabilitation and reformation. It is also observed throughout the world that death penalty is mostly declared to those groups of the society who are not able to afford expensive legal services. It boils down to people belonging to racial, ethnic and religious minority groups being meted out the death sentence. It is seldom awarded to a person from a socially and economically privileged background.
Also, death penalty encompasses the violation of basic human rights. Sometimes the state convicts the prisoners without affording them a fair trial. It denies the right to substantive due process, right to procedural due process and also the equality before the law.
International organisation like the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has analyzed that “capital punishment does not deter crime to a greater extent in comparison to the threat and application of the supposedly lesser punishment of life imprisonment.” Amnesty International stated that “the death penalty violates the most fundamental human right—the right to life. It is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment carried out in the name of justice.”
Since there is no deterrent effect of the death penalty in society, it is better to abolish the capital punishment and life imprisonment is preferable. There is no empirical proof of the death penalty having a deterrent effect (which is given as the major reason for not removing this punishment from the statute book) or vice versa. Thus, when there is no conclusive proof that it has a deterrent effect, peoples’ life should not be taken, unless such proof exists.
Before 1946, there was the provision of the death penalty in Nepal. But in that year, the death penalty was partially abolished for the ordinary crime. In 1985, it was reinstated for the offenses of homicides and terrorism. After that, in 1990, Nepal abolished the death penalty and de-constitutionalised the death penalty. In South Asia, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka have abolished capital punishment while, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Maldives have continued the practice.
The newly enacted Penal Offence (Punishment Determination and Implementation) Act, 2017 of Nepal which was implemented from August 17, 2018, has incorporated various new penal provisions such as community service, suspended sentence, reform homes, rehabilitation centres, open prisons, parole, probation etc.
Image credit: beinglibertarian.com
Section 13, of (Punishment Determination and Implementation) Penal Offence Act, 2017 explicitly prescribes that the purpose of punishment should be to deter the offender, rehabilitate the offender, and create a sense of remorse in the offender and so on. This suggests that the penal policy adopted by the criminal justice system of Nepal is of a reformative approach.
Also, the notable point is that Nepal is a signatory to a second optional protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which mandates the abolition of the death penalty. If we analyse the crime rate of countries where the death penalty is totally abolished and where the death penalty exists, we can observe that the crime rate of countries that abolished the death penalty is low. Thus, it cannot be conclusively said that the death penalty helps to control crime rate which by itself is enough reason to abolish it. Further, it also has drastic effects on not only the victim and his family but also on the way how society looks at and deals with crimes. There is no conclusive statistical evidence for the deterrent effect of the death penalty.
Since the judiciary in Nepal has such a large backlog of pending cases, it is safe to assume that the courts won’t be able to give as much time as they would have liked to in cases dealing with the death penalty where a person’s life is on balance. There is no point in realising the innocence of the victim after the execution. This places an extra burden on the courts to be careful in awarding capital punishment.
This is not to say that the punishment of the death penalty is itself justified. This can be illustrated through cases such as RV Crippen (England). In that case innocent Dr Crippen was hanged in haste due to lack of time in proper investigation. A 100 years after the execution it was proved that Crippen was innocent.
Courts attempt to pass verdicts on cases as soon as possible and due to this many innocent accused don’t get time to prove their innocence and lose their life. Thus, capital punishment should be abolished strictly. Imprisonment is better than the death sentence as a rehabilitated criminal can make a valuable contribution to society. Rehabilitation doesn’t only help those convicted of a crime and give them a chance to improve themselves. It also helps society in understanding the motives behind the crime and preventing society from such criminal acts.
Punishment is justified only if it is necessary as a means to some socially valid end. Long term imprisonment is sufficient as an invasion of individual liberty, privacy, and autonomy (and other fundamental values) to achieve valid social goals. Prisons serve as a better deterrent for crime as the fear of being deprived of liberty is greater than the fear of death.
There it is an erroneous belief that if criminals get hanged, families of murder victims feel relief. Instead, families of murder victims would be benefited by providing compensation, counselling and other assistance measures.

Moscow, 26 November (2019) – 
H.E. Anatoliy Vasilievich, Rector, Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO)
Distinguished faculty members
Dear students,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
First of all, I extend to you all warm greetings on behalf of the Government and people of Nepal and on my own.
My sincere thanks go to the Institute of International Relations for organizing today’s programme. The Institute’s continued partnership with the Embassy of Nepal at different forums reflects nothing but true affinity, close academic interaction and growing people-to-people exchange.
It is my distinct honour to meet with the faculty, students and researchers of this Institute of high repute here in Moscow on the occasion of my official visit to the Russian Federation.
I have heard a lot about the extraordinary contributions of MGIMO in the articulation of Russian foreign policy. As alma mater of top Russian diplomats, intellectuals and politicians, I commend your stellar performance, particularly in enhancing the scope of research and knowledge base in the field of contemporary global politics.
I am very pleased to be present amongst you to exchange our views and experiences on how we can best contribute from our respective sides to further strengthening the already warm bilateral relationship between Nepal and Russia.
We greatly value the continued dialogue and exchange by engaging all walks of life and different sectors of development. I offer my sincere appreciation to you all for playing an active role in strengthening multi-faceted ties that exist between Nepal and the Russian Federation.
Nepal and the Russian Federation are old and good friends. Ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1956, we have maintained cordial and friendly relations. This year marks the 63rd anniversary of the establishment of formal ties. I would like to extend warm felicitations to all of you on this happy occasion.
 
Esteemed Friends, 
 
In my presentation today I will briefly touch on three key aspects: Nepal-Russia relations; Nepal’s foreign policy orientation in the changed context; and Nepal’s development journey ahead and our priorities.
 
Let me first  pick up Nepal-Russia relations.
 
Nepal greatly values the bond of friendship it enjoys with the Russian Federation. Our relations have progressively evolved over the years to cover political, economic, social, cultural and educational dimensions. It is a multidimensional partnership.
Continued engagements at various levels and mutual cooperation in the areas of common interest have nurtured our friendship.
Parliamentary and judicial exchanges and frequent visits by high officials of both countries have contributed to widening the scope and enriching the substance of our relationship.
The objective of my visit this time, in my capacity as Foreign Minister of Nepal, has been to bolster trust, deepen political understanding, promote economic, commercial and cultural ties and strengthen collaboration in dealing with regional and global issues of common concern.
In this light, Foreign Minister Lavrov and I exchanged substantive views on a wide range of topics during our official talks yesterday. We agreed to work together to take our relations to the next level through enhanced political engagement and promotion of mutually beneficial cooperation in diverse fields. We underlined the importance of exchanging high level visits between the two countries, activating established bilateral consultation mechanism and concluding a host of agreements and understanding to further cooperative partnership.
I am satisfied with the outcome of our discussions and our consensus on the road ahead to realize the full potential of our mutual cooperation.
As you are aware, my visit has taken place in the fundamentally changed national context of Nepal. Nepal’s long political transition following a decade-long armed conflict has ended. A new democratic and inclusive Constitution promulgated in September 2015 has settled long-standing political issues. The elections held in 2017 under the provisions of the Constitution have produced a stable government with over two-thirds majority in the Parliament first time in two decades, thereby ending the cycle of political instability. Policy clarity and consistency in development efforts has been realized and the ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ has been defined as country’s overarching national aspiration. A clear sense of direction and commitment in the conduct of an independent and balanced foreign policy based on the notion of ‘amity with all, enmity with none’ has underpinned our worldview.
This visit is also about Nepal’s commitment to reenergizing all aspects of multi-faceted Nepal-Russia friendship. Needless to say, the full spectrum of our friendship is much more than the formal contacts. There has been an increasing level of cultural cooperation and interactions engaging the private sector and other people-to-people exchanges. Students, entrepreneurs, diaspora, scientists, artists, mountaineers, tourists and importantly the academia from both the countries have made significant contributions.
People-to-people relations give added value to Nepal-Russia relations, which began with the visit of the renowned Russian Scholar Ivan Pavloviech Minayev to Kathmandu in 1875. It has been reinforced by Russian literary icons like Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky and Pushkin who have great influence in Nepali literature. It is heartening that many Russians have attraction towards the Hindu, Buddhist and the Eastern philosophy.
Some Nepali and Russian nationals are residing in each other’s countries for a variety of reasons. I thank the Russian community for hosting Nepali nationals and supporting them.  I also express my sincere thanks to the friendly Russian people for their help in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in 2015. As Foreign Minister Lavrov told yesterday, the true friendship came into full play when Russia promptly and spontaneously sent a team of medical doctors along with humanitarian supplies for rescue and relief.
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
It is encouraging to witness continued progress achieved by the Russian Federation over the decades. In the fields of technologies, infrastructure, innovation and research, the progress has been remarkable. The Government, people and the academic circle of Nepal greatly appreciate these and many other stellar achievements made by the Russian Federation.
The steady course taken by Russia in achieving sustainable economic development, industrialization and high-end technological advancement have been glaring example of its perseverance and dedication. Over the decades, the Russian partnership with the global south has been increased.
Nepal sincerely appreciates support and cooperation extended by the Russian Federation in industrial and infrastructure development in the past. The technical cooperation has helped significantly lay the groundwork for Nepal’s economic development.
Nepal has learnt from Russia the development planning model.  Nepal adopted systematic and planned development efforts since 1956 and we have in place the 15th edition of the Development Plan. The best practices of the Soviet Planning model have helped Nepal shape its planning framework.
On a different note, Russian scholarships on higher education for Nepali students and public-sector professionals have been highly useful. There are a number of Nepali nationals trained in the Russian Federation occupying higher positions in politics, administration and the private sector today.
Nepal and the Russian Federation have been working closely in multilateral forums as well. One important avenue I would like to mention is the United Nations, which Nepal considers to be the cornerstone, custodian and emblem of multilateralism. With emphasis on a just and balanced world order for peace and stability, Nepal believes in multilateralism and rules-based international order.
At a time when the world is facing multiple challenges, the Russian initiatives in global fight against terrorism, cybercrime, climate change and other pressing global issues have been commendable. Let me underline that primacy of international law and value of world peace in the conduct of foreign policy help reduce tension and conflict.
Nepal has been contributing to the maintenance of the international peace and security by consistently and substantially supporting UN peacekeeping operations. Our troops are presently working in 15 out of 16 peacekeeping missions around the world and mostly in the troubled parts of the world. Russia, being a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has an important role to fulfill, together with other members, that peacekeeping missions accomplish their objectives in a timely manner within the given mandate. We call for enhanced consultation and coordination with TCCs/PCCs when taking important decision on peace missions.
Regional cooperation is one of the defining attributes of international relations today. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), founded jointly by the Russian Federation and other friendly countries in the region, is a new opportunity for institutionalizing a long-lasting environment for peace and prosperity in the region, and beyond. As a Dialogue Partner, Nepal has found SCO as an additional platform for engaging in mutually beneficial projects in a wide areas including trade, transit, investment, energy, agriculture, small and medium enterprises and culture. We are looking for a full-fledged membership of the organization to enhance our contribution. We are thankful to the Government of the Russian Federation that it was in Ufa, Russia, the decision to grant Nepal the dialogue partner status was taken.
Nepal has been collaborating, directly or indirectly, on matters of common interest with the Russian Federation in all available platforms. We will continue this in future.
Let me inform you, in this context, the Government of Nepal has established a permanent dialogue forum, Sagarmatha Sambaad (Mt Everest Dialogue) to deliberate on contemporary issues of national, regional and global significance. The first episode of this international dialogue platform will be devoted to the theme ‘climate change mountains and future of humanity’ and will be held on 2-4 April next year in Kathmandu. This will provide yet another opportunity for Nepal and Russia to strengthen partnership in the collective interest of humanity.
Distinguished guests,
Next aspect is Nepal’s foreign policy orientation.
Never colonized and subjugated, Nepal has always remained an independent nation. This speaks of our glorious history and evolution as a nation.
Our foreign policy orientation is very much influenced by this legacy. As I stated earlier, we pursue an independent, non-aligned, balanced foreign policy based on the philosophy of friendship and cooperation with all countries in the world. We do not believe in enmity. We do not nurture ill feelings towards anyone.
The UN Charter, the Panchasheel—the five principle of Peaceful Coexistence, non-alignment, respect for international law, value for world peace guide our foreign policy. We believe that respect for every country’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries are the essential ingredients of healthy inter-state relationship.
As with any other country, Nepal also gives priority to its relationship with its neighborhood and extended neighbourhood. We have defined that our relationship with neighbours and other countries is based on the principle of sovereign equality, mutual respect and benefit. Guided by this principle, the present Government has made substantial efforts to enhance and consolidate friendly ties and cooperative partnership with neighbours and other friendly countries. It is our principled commitment which we are translating into action that we will not let our territory to be used against the interest of our neighbours and any other friendly nation. This has helped us earn confidence and trust of neighbours.
Our immediate neighbours happen to be the world’s two most populous countries and the fastest growing economies. It gives Nepal ample prospects for its economic development. We have the potential to be a vibrant bridge connecting the two sides for common benefits.
As a region full of potentials, diversity and challenges, South Asia should continue to engage in promoting the collective interest with utmost sense of regional solidarity, mutual respect and accommodation divergent views. We want peace and stability in our region and beyond. We believe that all differences can be resolved amicably through peaceful means.
Major powers, such as the Russian Federation, development partners and other friendly countries are in the priority of our foreign policy orientation. We have significantly enhanced our partnership with this group of countries. We are committed to further widen and deepen our relationship for mutual benefit. These countries are an important source of our development financing and trade relationship. Beyond neighbourhood, they are also a source of inbound tourists and technology.
The labour receiving countries are also in our priorities, as a large number of Nepali migrant workers are living there for employment. We are trying to diversify our relations with them to cover such vital areas as trade, investment, tourism and transfer of technology.
Regional cooperation features prominently in our foreign policy priority. We want to promote meaningful regional cooperation for the collective well-being of the people in the region. We attach importance to SAARC and BIMSTEC as principal vehicles for regional cooperation in our region. As I said earlier, we want to enhance our engagement in SCO. We are also pursuing the objective of sub-regional cooperation within the framework of BBIN-Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. We are also a member of the Asian Cooperation Dialogue.
Our commitment to UN Charter is unflinching. We are a strong supporter of multilateralism. As discussed earlier, the UN is an indispensable global institution for us as it is the only legitimate organization which is capable of dealing with a host of contemporary issues we face today. Ours is an international perspective that believes in collective prosperity of mankind and rejects unilateralism. We stand for general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. We support nuclear free zones and peace zones. We unequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
We call for a just, harmonious, inclusive and peaceful world order where all nations enjoy their rights while fulfilling their obligations in good faith.
Economic diplomacy has been a key component of our overall diplomacy.  We are building economic partnership with friendly countries focusing on trade, investment, tourism, technology transfer, climate financing and decent jobs for migrant workers. Our diplomatic missions have been tasked to promote economic diplomacy to support our national drive for rapid yet sustainable development.
Distinguished friends,
Let me touch on the last component of my presentation. That is about our development priorities.
Economic transformation is our most important national task ahead. We are still an LDC.  We have additional difficulties as well. We are a country emerged from conflict and we are also a landlocked countries. This sums up the nature of our development challenges, which are of course manifold and complex.
Development is a national responsibility and we are fully aware of it. But our domestic resources are not sufficient to overcome our huge development challenges. And, we do not have luxury to wait for long, as we are lagging behind. We have to quicken the pace.
Our immediate goal is to graduate from LDC and become middle-income country by 2030 which is also the deadline for the realization of SDGs. We have envisioned a long-term plan to achieve national prosperity by 2041. We will redouble our efforts to realize the national aspiration of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ within this timeframe.
Towards realizing the national aspiration, we will expediate the process of economic development. While internal resources are important, we count on international support and goodwill to enhance trade performance and seek enhanced level of foreign direct investment. With a view to attracting foreign direct investment, we hosted an Investment Summit in Kathmandu in March this year. The Summit attracted a large number of prospective investors, including from Russia.
To make the business environment more attractive, friendly and competitive, investment related laws and institutions have undergone constant reform. For example, Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act (FITTA), Public Private Partnership and Investment Act, Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Act have been promulgated and One-Stop Service has already been operationalized. Some other legislative reforms are in the pipeline such as Intellectual Property Rights Act.
Nepal’s friendly investment climate is evident from the World Bank’s Doing Business Report. Its latest report ranks Nepal among South Asia’s most favourable countries for ease of doing business.
Nepal has huge hydropower potentials. Exploitation of this precious resource can change the economic face of our country and the region. Investment in this sector is highly profitable as there is no problem of market. Regulatory framework exists to facilitate export of power generated in Nepal to India and Bangladesh.
Agriculture, tourism, mines and minerals, infrastructure development and IT are some of the areas where investment can be highly profitable. We have a liberal investment regime that allows investment in almost all sectors. Negative list is very short. We also offer a range of incentives that are unique and special to our context.
At this juncture, Nepal has high hope of solidarity and support from our trusted friends. Your own involvement or encouragement to the business community to explore investment opportunities in Nepal would go a long way. Nepal is fully committed to protect your investments. Political stability gives policy stability, which is the fundamental element to ensure predictability in foreign investment regime.
At present the level of trade and economic engagement between Nepal and the Russian Federation stands at a modest level. Rather than staying discouraged with the figures, I think it should be taken as an opportunity to attain a higher and swifter level of trade, commercial and investment engagements between us.
It is upon us–the Governments, the private sector, academia and people of all walks of life–to strive for meaningful and substantive cooperation in all sectors, including trade, investments and tourism. There is a need to energize the role of Nepal-Russia Chamber of Commerce and Industries towards building business networks and kickstart doable projects in hand.
As you may be aware, Nepal is celebrating 2020 as Visit Nepal Year. An increased number of Russian friends to visit Nepal for tourism would greatly help the campaign. Nepal is a must-visit destination in one’s lifetime. Famous Poet Rasul Gamzatov was right when he described Nepal as ‘diamond yet to be crafted’. Investment in Nepal’s tourism infrastructure, which remains one of the lucrative areas, will also greatly help boost Nepal’s economy.
The Embassy of Nepal will work closely with you all, including the Non-Resident Nepali Association, Chambers, Friendship Associations and other partners, to make the Visit Nepal Year a success. As your good friend and also as the Foreign Minister, I would like to extend to you all a very warm invitation to visit Nepal at your convenience.
As I conclude, I once again appreciate you all for organizing this function and also for your kind presence. Ambassador Rishi Ram Ghimire and his team deserve my special appreciation for the hard work.
I am confident that today’s interaction will contribute to continue the momentum of our exchange and mutual understanding. This platform should continue to explore new ideas, academic exchange and avenues towards further enhancing Nepal-Russia relations in the coming years. I count on your support and solidarity.
I thank you.

Adopting a nation’s Constitution is a matter of pride for every country and the people living therein. The ratification of the Constitution is a sign that the country has geared up for consolidating the agendas of different political movements in the state. With this spirit, India adopted and enacted its first Constitution on November 26, 1949.
The Constitution of India, which entered into force on January 26, 1950, begins with a preamble with the opening words of “We, the people…” with which the preamble of UN Charter and US Constitution also start. The Preamble, which was adopted on October 17, 1949, is divided into three parts on the basis of its qualitative characteristics, viz., declarative; revolutionary and promissory. In other words, preamble broadly reflects three things: the source of the Constitution; objects and goals including rights and freedoms for Indian citizens living under the Constitution and the date of adoption of the Constitution.
This way, ‘the preamble reflected the changes that had come over the country as a result of the partition and integration of the Indian states’, said KM Munshi, member of the Constituent Assembly of India.
Facts:

Constitution of India adopted and enacted on November 26, 1949
Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950
Constituent Assembly met in sessions for 166 days
It took 2 years 11 months 18 days to give birth to the lengthiest Constitution of the world
It features 395 Articles, divided into 22 parts and 12 Schedules
Now, its home to 448 Articles in 25 parts and 12 Schedules
Chief architect of Indian Constitution: Dr BR Ambedkar
Chief advisor: Sir BN Rao

Despite these things, the Constitution of India would not have evolved like US Constitution or other Constitutions of the world unless there was a brave Supreme Court put in place to work as guardian of the Constitution. The apex Court of India played an instrumental role in advancing the cause of judicial review and constitutionalism. If facts and figures are something to stand by, India’s neighbors have experimented with many Constitutions to consolidate the democratic credentials. But India adopted a Constitution and she does not wish to compete with her neighbors in enacting the number of Constitutions. Pakistan adopted its first Constitution in 1956, second in 1962 and third in 1973. Similarly, Nepal has experimented with seven Constitutions in 70 years with first in 1948, second in 1951, third in 1959, fourth in 1962, fifth in 1990, sixth in 2007 and seventh in 2015.
There are series of cases where the apex Court of India has responded firmly to give effect to the cause of constitutionalism.
The question whether the word ‘law’ in Article 13 also includes ‘constitutional amendments’ was for the first time considered by the Supreme Court in Shankari Prasad v. Union of India (AIR 1951). The Court held that the word law defined under Article 13(3) did not include law made by parliament under Article 368 [amendment clause]. This interpretation of Shankari Prasad’s case was followed by the majority in Sajjan Singh v State of Rajasthan (1965).  But the top Court laid down a differing view in IC Golakhnath v. State of Punjab (1967) by overruling its decisions pronounced in the aforesaid two cases. It was held that the word ‘law’ in Article 13 did include an amendment to the Constitution passed under Article 368.
Miffed with the verdict of the court, the Indian parliament passed the Constitution (24th Amendment) Act, 1971 to nullify the ruling of IC Golakhnath case. This amendment inserted Clause (4) in Article 13 and Clause (3) in Article 368 to the effect, “Nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article 368.” The Constitutionality of this amendment was upheld by the Supreme Court in Keshvanand Bharati v. State of Kerala (AIR 1973). It thus laid the controversy to rest. It follows that the term “law” in Article 13 excludes an amendment of the Constitution made under Article 368.
The Keshvanand Bharati case is one of the finest judgments of Supreme Court of India which brought a new constitutional dawn in India.
However, the Keshvanand Bharati case is one of the finest judgments of Supreme Court of India which brought a new constitutional dawn in India. The Court offered a long list of features as basic structure of Indian Constitution which can neither be amended nor be nullified by the parliament. The supremacy of Constitution; republic and democratic form of government; secular form of government; separation of power; federal character of constitution; unity and integrity of nation; sovereignty of India; democratic character of policies of India; individual freedoms; or welfare state were held to be the basic structure of Indian Constitution, meaning thereby the parliament of India is not competent to amend or nullify these foundations of Indian Constitution.
In Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narayan, the Supreme Court added rule of law; judicial review; democracy and fair election; and objectives mentioned in preamble as basic structures of Indian Constitution.
In L Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997), the apex Court of India held that clause 2 (d) of Article 323A and clause 3 (d) of Article 323B to the extent they exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court and Supreme Court under Articles 226, 227 and 32 would be unconstitutional and for the same reason Section 28 of Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985 which contains the “exclusion of jurisdiction” clause also held unconstitutional. With this, the apex Court held that the decisions of tribunal can be challenged before the Division Bench of High Court. It is to be noted here that Article 323 A (2d) and Article 323B (3d) were inserted through amendment in Constitution to curtail the power of High Court. But these two provisions were held ultra-vires to the Constitution by the apex Court. In doing so, the Court expanded the horizon of judicial review. Now, the power of judicial review cannot be abrogated even by the amendment of Constitution.

Recently, Ayodhya verdict too could be taken as one of the landmark judgments. The Court succeeded to put the controversies at rest by paving the ways for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya. The court relied on documentary evidences, travelogues and others to arrive at a conclusion. This too conforms that the people have faith on judiciary. They consider judicial department as the last resort. India believes that the Supreme Court is there to prevail constitutionalism over undemocratic acts.
This year India celebrates 70th Constitution Day. The Supreme Court of India has played an instrumental role in strengthening the constitutional ethos with which Indian democracy is moving forward. Nepal needs to learn from India’s constitutional guarantee of constitutionalism and its longevity. Changing the Constitution every 10 years shows that our leaders lack a long term vision. We need to ensure the durability of this hallowed document.

Implementation of constitutionally and legally guaranteed right to information (RTI) with a focus on its proactive disclosure offers ample opportunities for local governments to build the image of open government, stakeholders said.
An informed citizenry can only provide civic oversight on the decisions and functions of the government and public authorities, paving the way for transparent and accountable local government, the speakers noted.
At a national-level consultative seminar on ‘RTI for good governance in local governments’ organized by Freedom Forum in the capital on Tuesday, constitutional expert Kashiraj Dahal said corruption and irregularities do not get space where the RTI and people’s participation are effective. “Local governments have a chance to transform them to open government by effectively enforcing the right to information. It is critically important when some local governments are now charged with graft cases”, he said.
Presenting a working paper on ‘Importance of RTI for transparent, accountable and responsive local government’, he called for the local governments to make their oversight bodies including legislative committee, public accounts committee and good governance committee functional for effective oversight. “Through effective oversight these committees can be instrumental in checking irregularities and corruption propping up in local governments “, he said.
The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA)’s recent 61-point recommendations has empirically claimed that the local governments are increasingly misusing their power. Dahal, also the coordinator of the seven-member RTI Bill drafting taskforce, encouraged RTI activists and advocates to use RTI for governance reforms by demanding information in the critical areas of governance such as planning, budget formulation, procurement and arrears.
Commenting on the paper, governance expert Dr Mukti Rijal also underscored the need to make opposition and oversight mechanism strong and effective at the local level in line with the principle of check and balance and separation of power. “Nepal’s local government is constitutionally formed as a very strong structure with concurrent powers along with federal and state governments, right of the locally elected chiefs and deputy chiefs of the local governments to vote to elect National Assembly members.”
He insisted the need of massive citizen education for wider civic engagement to enable them to see and oversee local governance affairs and protect the strengths of local government structure of Nepal.
Dhangadhi sub-metropolis Mayor Nripa Wod, while rendering comment on the paper, said the efforts for delivering good governance are not being supported by administrative staffs in many instances. Wod underlined the need to sensitize senior local government staffs on RTI for its effective implementation.
Likewise, presenting another working paper ‘Importance of practice of proactive disclosure at local government and its legal arrangement’, Dharmendra Jha, RTI expert, highlighted the need of compliance with the RTI laws focusing on both reactive and proactive disclosure at local level. “Every local government are legally obliged to proactively disclose minimum 20 types of administrative, financial, services and audit related information, among others in every three months”, he said, adding the local governments are ignoring to meet their RTI-stipulated obligations.
Rendering comments on the paper, Secretary of National Information Commission (NIC) Maniram Ojha highlighted the role of NIC as regulatory body to dispense justice to the information requesters when their applications are not entertained.
Amargadhi municipality deputy mayor Sangeeta Bhandari presented use of various technological tools and mechanisms in her local government in ensuring citizens’ access to information of public areas.
Freedom Forum Executive Chief Taranath Dahal said the national seminar was organized to amplify the voice for implementation of RTI for good governance at local level and help build the good image of local governments. “Improving citizen-state engagement through RTI enables open and transparent government. The event will serve this purpose and leverage local governance reforms”, he added.
Chiefs and deputy chiefs of different 12 local governments and representatives of CSOs from Sindhupalchowk, Lalitpur, Dhangadhi, Dadeldhura, Achham and Bajhang shared the best practices of governance in their areas. The local government authorities pledged to bring RTI into implementation and promote evidence-based planning and programming at local level.
As many as 75 participants including state assembly members, mayors/chairs, deputy mayors/vice-chair, government officials, information officers and representatives of CSOs, private sector, universities and media took part in the seminar.

Surkhet, 23 January (2020) – About 10 days ago Barahatal Rural Municipality in Surkhet district in mid-western Nepal organized Masto (native god) worship ceremony.
On that occasion a local woman Sirjana Karki asked the shaman, “The government has brought down chaau goth (huts for menstrual exile). It does not allow us to stay in the huts whereas Masto does not permit us to live inside the house. Where do we go?”
All the shamans in the village were attending the ceremony. Karki seized the opportunity to ask them where menstruating women could stay.
One of the shamans replied, “Stay in a room inside the house and don’t go to the prayer room”
Menstruating women in mid-western and far-western Nepal have been traditionally forced to stay in narrow huts since long. But the government has been tearing down the huts to break the traditional belief and is taking action against anyone who forces women to go to chhau huts.
This campaign, however, put women in limbo. But they are feeling comfortable after shamans allowed them to stay inside the house during periods.
Mana BK of Aathbis Municipality in Dailekh district stays in cowshed after policemen tore down the chhau huts. “We are afraid of Devata (god). We have been following the tradition out of the fear of the god,” BK said.
“The government destroyed huts but we have not cast out chhau tradition from our minds.”
Sita Baduwal of Panchapuri Municipality-10 said that the government has torn down chhau huts but has not raised awareness against the tradition.
“We are habituated to observe chhau ritual. Shamans can help in dispelling this belief,” she said.
She pointed out at the need of local government taking initiative to raise awareness against chhau ritual.
Dhan Bahadur Thapa, Ward Chief, Panchapuri Municipality-1, said that pulling down chhau huts merely cannot solve problems. “We knocked down chhau huts in the past as well but people rebuilt them. Raising awareness is the most important thing to remove chhau ritual,” he said.
District Administration Office Surkhet has started the campaign to demolish chhau tradition. Chief District Officer Basanta Adhikari said that more than 1,200 chhau huts in Surkhet have been brought down till date.
“We have started to destroy chhau huts following the directive of the Ministry of Home Affairs. All of us are doing our best to uproot this social evil. All three tiers of government are committed to this,” he said.

Kathmandu, 21 January (2020) – Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi and his Nepal counterpart Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, jointly inaugurated Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Biratnagar on Tuesday.
They also witnessed progress of pro-earthquake rebuilding of 50,000 private houses in Gorkha and Nuwakot districts of Nepal. Both Prime Ministers carried out the inauguration via video-conferencing from the respective capitals. Indian NSA Shri Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary Shri Vijay Gokhale and Ambassador of Nepal to India H.E. Mr. Nilambar Acharya attended the inaugurations from New Delhi and Mr Pradeep Gyawali, Foreign Minister, Mr Lekhraja Bhatta, Minister of Commerce, Industry and Supplies of Nepal and Dr Ajay Kumar, Charge d’Affaires, Embassy of India, Nepal witnessed the event from Kathmandu.
India and Nepal have agreed to build ICPs along both sides of the border to facilitate two-way trade and movement of people. ICP Birgunj was inaugurated in April 2018 with the aim to facilitate and improve Nepal’s two-way trade with India and third countries.
The work on the newly built ICP Biratnagar started in December 2016 and completed in October 2019. It has been built at a cost of NRs 2.24 billion by Government of India. The ICP puts in place systematically planned, properly interconnected and efficiently managed border check-posts at the authorized JogbaniBiratnagar border crossing point between the two countries. It is expected to facilitate movement of traffic and enhance trade between the two countries. The ICP has integrated three main border related functions i.e. customs, immigration & border security and facilitates movement of both passenger and freight between the two countries. Biratnagar is the 3rd largest revenue collecting check post on Nepal side and is expected to reduce the waiting and processing time considerably.

ICP is equipped with all modern facilities like, warehousing facilities including the refrigerated cargo, electronic weighbridges, 100% power backup, fire safety, dedicated communication network and 24×7 monitoring through CCTV & Public Announcement systems. Adequate facilities for quarantine, amenities for drivers, passengers and security personnel have also been created, along with a waste water treatment plant and large scale landscaping and tree plantation to conserve and enhance the environment.
For re-building earthquake-resilient 50,000 private houses in Gorkha and Nuwakot districts, Government of India is contributing US$ 100 million grant and US$ 50 million soft loan. For ensuring that the home-owners rebuild their homes with earthquake resilient features, Government of India has hired the services of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Nepal and United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) in Gorkha and Nuwakot districts, respectively.
Till date, 45,057 households (90.1%) have reconstructed their houses. India has so far reimbursed an amount of NRs 6.96 billion from grant and NRs 3.11 billion from soft loan to Nepal.

Government of India remains committed to continue partnering with the people and Government of Nepal towards its endeavour for ‘Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepali’.

They were staying at Everest Panorama resort on Monday.
DSP Sunil Singh Rathore said that all of them were staying in the same room and had switched the gas heater on. They seem to have asphyxiated because of the crowd and the gas heater.
Resort staff informed the police after finding all eight of them in unconscious condition.
All the dead tourists have been identified. Ranjit Kap, 38, Indra, 34, Prabin, 37, Sariya, 32, Abhi, 5, Archana, 7, Baishnav, 5 and Wandra, 9 have died.

Janakpurdham, 19 January (2020) – On January 30, 2007 a protest rally starts from Bidyapati Chowk in Janakapur as part of the Madhesh movement. Rajesh Kumar Thakur, a ninth standard student at Sankatmochan School, participates in the rally.
The police opens fire at the crowd when it reaches Basahiya Chowk. Many people are wounded and the crowd scatters.
Rajesh was at the front of the crowd. He fell down on the spot. Protestors took him to Janakpur Zonal Hospital.
The hospital referred him to BP Koirala Health Science Institute, Dharan. He breathed his last after 12 hours of treatment.
Rajesh was the eldest son of Tapeshwar Thakur and Kusumi Devi hailing from Prakauli Village Development Committee in Mahottari district.
Without any lands to do agriculture, Tapeshwar came to Janakpur. He opened a hair salon at Janakpur Buspark to feed his family.
Rajesh was helping his father in the salon and studying in the school. But a bullet from the police took his life in his prime youth.
Government of Nepal declared him martyr and provided 100,000 rupees to his family. Kusumi Devi says that those who facilitated to provide that amount took away 50,000 rupees.
The family bought a house with 500,000 rupees. The remaining amount was spent on the wedding of Rajesh’s sister.
Their salon was brought down last year while expanding the road.
Rajesh’s father Tapeshwar died last year.
Now Rajesh’s brother Brikhesh shoulders the responsibility of feeding his family. He is working at another salon.
Brikhesh says, “I earn from 300 to 500 rupees a day and feed my mother, wife and children with it.”
Last year Lal Babu Raut, Chief Minister of Province-2, committed to provide government jobs to members of the martyr family while speaking at the Balidani Diwas (Sacrifice Day) in Lahan.
Raut had even given a contact paper to the martyr families. Brikhesh went to the Office of the Chief Minister (CM) with his mother and filled out the form for the job. But that led him nowhere.
“The CM has not called us as yet. I have no academic qualifications. I would be grateful to the province government if it appoints me to the post of a driver,” he said.
Madhesh-centric parties celebrate Balidani Diwas every day on 19 January. Kusumi Devi said that the leaders used to remember the families of the martyrs earlier but they have not paid attention afterwards.
Upendra Yadav who is credited for leading the Madhesh movement had met Rajesh’s parents in Janakpur and told them that his party would take responsibility for the whole family. But Kusumi Devi says that Yadav did not meet them afterwards. “No one asks how we are living and what the condition of our family is,” she says.
Rajesh’s story is an emblematic case of the state’s negligence of martyr families. Both the federal government and the provincial government have completely ignored the plights of the victims of Madhesh movement.
Even the political parties who led the victims during the movement have ditched them. Martyr family and family of the wounded have said that they have been unheeded.

There are people in this world who are calm, collected and easy-going.
And then there’s Dr. Peter Johnson, a gynecologic oncologist in Green Bay.
We first introduced him in October, just before he left for a two-month sabbatical at a Buddhist monastery in Nepal.
We met up with him again, now that he’s back home, as he says the experience not only changed him, but his staff and patients, too.
“The trip was really good. Certainly the Packers game on Sunday between the Seahawks and Packers… the third quarter got me back to where I was before any meditation, but by the end of the game, thank you Aaron, I got back to normal,” says Dr. Johnson, the director of gynecologic oncology at Aurora BayCare Medical Center in Green Bay.
His new normal exudes peace, compassion and gratitude for everything in his life and anyone around him.
“My nurses tell me I’m more behind in clinic every day because I’m spending more time with each patient, so yes, I think it does feel different to the patients as well, and it seems like people have opened up a whole lot more,” he says.
Dr. Johnson has been meditating for years, but spending a month in the Kopan Monastery, a formal Tibetan Buddhist retreat in Nepal, took him to a deeper level.
“You can remodel your life based on speech, based on your mind and your body,” he says. “Those three things. You mind those things, you could have a great life right there.”
As someone who wants to take away suffering for others, Dr. Johnson says transforming his thoughts and actions and focusing on being less stressed has a healing effect on his patients and their families.
In his two month trip, he also went through a physical transformation, losing weight from an all vegetarian diet and trekking through the rugged Himalayas.
“It was incredible. It was very brutal. Talk about steps… it was thousands,” says Dr. Johnson. “It was old trading routes, basically, that you walked down. The energy was beyond description. It was amazing.”
At the top, he experienced breathtaking views.
Dr. Johnson also visited a primitive hospital in the mountains, run by a nurse, and the university hospital in Kathmandu.
He’s now working to set up an exchange program for their doctors to visit Green Bay and for him to go back to Nepal and help there. It’s all about giving back.
“These are kids that are just starting out. Young doctors, just starting out… to be able to positively influence them, how awesome,” he says.
The whole experience gave him a new appreciation and understanding of how we all impact each other.

Kathmandu, 13 January (2020) – Bishnu Lama, an alleged goon, has accused the police of firing at him two hours after the arrest.
The police had fired at Lama in Jammudada in Kathmandu district Sunday evening.
Lama told Lokantar that the police arrested him while he was sipping tea at a teashop in Buddha at 3:30 pm and shot at him at 5:30 pm. He claims that he was handcuffed at the time the police fired at him.
He is being treated at Trauma Centre in Kathmandu. Following is the edited version of his statement to Lokantar:
My house is near Medical College at Bouddha. I was drinking tea at a shop near my house with my friends when policemen in plainclothes arrested me.
The police took me around Bouddha area in their van. I was handcuffed.
I had been staying in India for the last six months and had come to Nepal after my relatives called me to settle the case of killing a child.
I thought that the case would settle soon when the police approached me.
The police took me to Jammudada at around 5:30 pm. Two policemen were talking there. One of them came up from behind and took me to trees behind police beat. They put my legs in between those trees and shot at the right leg.
I was stained in blood. Then they took me to Metropolitan Police Circle, Bouddha in their van. The policemen put me in another van and took me to the trauma centre.
There are reports that I threw stones at the police. But these are false reports.
The police, however, has denied claims that they shot at Lama after taking him into control. They maintain that Lama tried to run away and had to be shot at to take under control.
“Other absconding accused were with him. We were trying to nab them. Lama tried to run away and the police shot at him,” Ramesh Singh, DSP and Metropolitan Police Circle Chief, told Lokantar. DSP Singh said that the claim that police shot at Lama after taking under control is false.

Shrubs and grasses are springing up around Mount Everest and across the Himalayas, one of the most rapidly heating regions of the planet.
The impact on water supplies of the small but significant increase in vegetation between the treeline and snowline is not yet known but could increase flooding in the vast Hindu Kush Himalayan region, which covers 4.2msq km(1.6m sq miles), feeds Asia’s 10 largest river systems and supplies 1.4 billion people with water.
Scientists used satellite data to identify increases in vegetation in the inaccessible subnival (the highest zone allowing plant growth) ecosystem, made up of grasses and dwarf shrubs with seasonal snow. This ecosystem is known but could play a crucial role in the region’s hydrology, covering between five and 15 times the area of permanent glaciers and snow in the region.
Studying images from 1993 to 2018 provided by Nasa’s Landsat satellites, researchers from Exeter University measured the spread of vegetation cover across four height brackets from 4,150 to 6,000 metres above sea level.
The melting of Himalayan glaciers has doubled since the turn of the century, with more than a quarter of all ice lost over the last four decades. Research has suggested that its ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate-induced shifts in vegetation.
“A lot of research has been done on ice melting in the Himalayan region, including a study that showed how the rate of ice loss doubled between 2000 and 2016,” said Dr Karen Anderson, of the Environment and Sustainability Institute on Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall.
“It’s important to monitor and understand ice loss in major mountain systems, but subnival ecosystems cover a much larger area than permanent snow and ice, and we know very little about them and how they moderate water supply.”
It is not yet known how more vegetation might affect water supplies but studies of increased vegetation in the Arctic found that they delivered a warming effect in the surrounding landscape, with the plants absorbing more light and warming the soil.
“That would be bad news for the Himalayas,” said Anderson. “The subnival zone is where seasonal snow is held and if it is warmer you will get flashy hydrology – quicker melt rates and an increased risk of flooding.”
But Anderson said that more vegetation may not actually increase warming and flood risks in the Himalayas, with the only study in the region, in Tibet, finding that the water in the plants that is evaporated through their leaf surface actually exerted a cooling influence.
“We really don’t know much about this area and we need to direct research attention towards it because it’s a major part of the water supply story in the Himalayas,” she added.
The study, published in Global Change Biology, was made possible by Google’s new Earth Engine, which provides researchers with a freely accessible collection of government agency satellite data in the cloud. Previously, researchers would have had to build a super-computer to sift through the enormous quantities of satellite data.
“It has really revolutionised this kind of work and enables large-scale, long time-series investigations like this to happen,” said Anderson.

Kathmandu, 9 January (2020) – Traffic police in crowded Kathmandu roads complain that they are forced to hold their urine for around five hours.
Traffic police officers have 10-hour shift each day. They carry out duties in two shifts and face the problem of peeing.
Lapse of concentration for even a minute can cause traffic havoc therefore a traffic officer doesn’t have the luxury of answering the call of nature, Police Personnel Lila Ram Thapa said. Holding on to their pee, traffic police personnel have to wave their hands and blow whistles.
Thapa directs traffic at Thamel-Galkopakha section. He said, “How can I pee? The traffic will be chaotic if I leave for even a second. On top of that, there is no proper place to pass urine. I pee in the morning before taking the shift and take a leak after the end of the shift. I hold urine during duty hours.”
Traffic police personnel Thapa told Lokantar that there is heavy traffic during rush hour (9 to 11 am) and he can’t leave duty for even a second. “Normally two traffic police personnel are deployed in an intersection but they can’t pee due to pressure of traffic management,” he said.
Traffic policeman Subas Tamang manages traffic in Balaju and he shares the same experience.
Kesharmahal chowk is the busiest stretch in Kathmandu. Around four traffic police personnel manage traffic there.
Moti Lal Kahdka manages traffic there. He said, “This road has the heaviest traffic. How can I take time off to pee?”
Senior nephrologist Dr. Rishi Kumar Kafle said that holding urine for a long time adversely impacts kidneys and leads to urine infection.
He said, “The government should build proper toilets keeping traffic police personnel’s health in mind.”
There is not even a proper toilet for traffic police personnel. Public toilets are very few in number. Traffic policemen say that they can’t use the toilet in people’s house or the hotel.
Traffic policeman Tamang said, “There are no public toilets here. Whose house do I enter to pee? There is no alternative to holding the urine.”
Traffic police has been strict in penalizing the defaulters of late. Policemen say that it is the reason why people don’t allow them to pee in their homes.
“Earlier we ignored ordinary traffic violations. But these days we take immediate action against violators. That is why people don’t allow us to use their toilets,” traffic police inspector Jitesh Dahal said.

Independent judiciary plays an important role in democratic dispensation. The Constitution has also accepted this reality. Part 11 of the Constitution provides for judiciary. Separation of powers ensures that there would be no pressure and influence on justice delivery.
The Supreme Court of Nepal has formed a four-member committee under the coordination of Justice Hari Krishna Karki on 23 May to study avenues to keep I/NGOs away from judiciary. The Committee is expected to submit a report incorporating suggestions within 20 July.
RoLHR programme conducted by foreign organisations through United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) ended in December 2017. It had been providing aid for training, study visits and protection of human rights. But service seekers and advocates of clean judiciary have been feeling that donors exert undue influence on judiciary. Therefore raising of voices was mandatory. The reactions expressed during lawyers’ conference in Nepalgunj need to be appreciated in this context.
UNDP is a UN agency but it does not have independent financial resources. It collects resources from different countries to carry out different projects in Nepal. While implementing these projects, donors have been forcing to execute activities that go contrary to Nepal’s religious and social values and norms. There are also instances of donors unnecessarily inciting Tibetan issues to muddy Nepal’s relationship with China.
Multiple stories in the press have shown that agents of foreign organisations have been alluring top officials of the highest level of judiciary with special allowances and foreign junkets in order of influence them to prepare laws that reflect controversial norms and values, policies and licentiousness in the western world. Sadly, human rights activists and women right activists have gone with this flow. Its consequences will ultimately not be beneficial.
Government officers and consultants should immediately put a brake on activities that are oriented towards donors’ interests rather than Nepal’s social circumstances and foreign policy. Failing to do that, they should be subjected to punishment for working against the country. The currently formed committee in the Supreme Court needs to submit a report recommending immediate halt to foreign aid that impacts the judiciary. Frankly speaking, there was no need to form a committee for this purpose. The conclusion is clear. Absolutely no foreign aid should be taken in direct agreement with foreign agency if we are to keep people’s faith and belief in the judiciary. It is inappropriate to forward donors’ proposals without coordinating with Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The annual budget of the government should manage all resources needed for the functioning of judiciary including the Supreme Court. There should be a provision of increment in budget allocation in consideration of price inflation. It is mandatory to end the situation in which justices have to beg for necessary budget for the judiciary. Otherwise, the executive will have negative impact on judiciary.
Any aid in cash and kind offered by donor countries and foreign organisations need to arrive through government channels. A strong policy of depositing such aid money in a consolidated fund and spending it on the basis of priorities set by the government needs to be implemented. It would be harmful for the country to chase after priorities set by the donors.

http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/change-in-government/,"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has shown maturity in resigning from his post at the end of his address to the parliament after facing the no-confidence motion. He deserves accolades for taking the uncomplicated path in murky national politics. It was obvious that had the no-trust motion been taken to voting process, political polarization would have increased at unwanted level.
After main coalition partner NCP (Maoist Centre) withdrew support to KP Oli-led government, the coalition government came into precarious position. Oli had two other alternatives apart from resignation: taking vote of confidence from the House or face the no-trust motion. Initially, Oli opted for the third alternative. But he did not let the process reach voting process and submitted his resignation to President Bidya Devi Bhandari before votes could be cast against him. Later, Speaker Onsari Gharti read out the letter received from the Office of the President in the parliament and brought this episode to an end. Had Oli taken the voting route, he had to be removed from his post and it would have been morally difficult for him to remain in the leadership of his party after being gracelessly removed in such manner.
While responding to the motion, Oli logically recounted the achievements during his tenure of nine months. Initial challenges in implementation of constitution, protests by Terai-based parties and impacts of India’s blockade on Nepal became the subjects of his address. Even the opposition parties have not taken exception to Oli’s achievements in inking trade and transportation agreement with China during his state visit to that country. But Nepal has to wait for a while to take advantage of the alternative route because it takes time to prepare physical infrastructure like roads in difficult geographical regions. Whatever the case, his efforts have created base for lessening excessive dependence on India.
The constitution that courted controversy at the very beginning has become more complex after Oli’s resignation. Hurry made in promulgating a piece of document at any cost has created different types of lacunae and lack of clarity. Series of amendments immediately after promulgation of the constitution have made it clear that those holding fate of 28 million Nepalis lack a long-term vision. After Oli’s resignation, some lawyers and constitution experts gave ridiculous arguments that there is no provision for choosing another prime minister in the constitution. This spurious suggestion seems to have befuddled Oli himself and he talked about it in his response. Some other experts were talking about taking this issue to the court. But political issues like these should be resolved through mutual dialogues and healthy competition. They should not be taken to court. Worryingly, promulgators of constitution deliberately provided a space for controversy.
Replacing a communist government with another communist party will satiate the power-hungry lot. Expecting more is meaningless.

http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/foreign-relations-jeopardy/,"The fate of 21 people selected as Nepal’s ambassadors to different countries three months ago has become uncertain now as the government that recommended their names is to face no-confidence motion. It is clear that the new government replacing Oli will not send those same names to the parliamentary hearing process. Especially, people recommended as envoys due to their loyalty to individual parties are in risk of not getting the post. The move to establish party loyalists to plum posts, disregarding educational qualifications and experiences, had invited derisions.
Only the experienced government officers who have passed public service examinations and taken different training can operate foreign missions and bilateral ties effectively. Representatives to the United Nations bear the responsibility of resolving multilateral diplomatic challenges.
Politically appointed ambassadors are there in the missions to add value only. But that too demands skills, ability and commitment. All these qualities are hardly found in average political activists. That is why political leaders in the new government have to use their discretion in selecting Nepal’s envoy to foreign states.
Diplomatic experts say that vacancy of the post of ambassador in friendly states means that Nepal does not want to have relations with these countries. Can Nepal fulfill its international duties with such a policy of indifference? Should not Nepal government remain alert to keep sensitive relationship with China and India in balance, given our geographical location?
We have been hearing from our leaders that the country is in transition and crisis. But they do not seem to have realized that foreign ties should be given due importance to take the country of out of such situation. If the embassies that spend millions for maintenance each year remain ineffective, what is their necessity in the first place? The government cannot afford any delay in providing due solution to this problem.

http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/face-the-parliament/,"The country has been pushed to a new phase of stability after CPN (Maoist Centre), main party in the coalition government under Prime Minister KP Oli, decided to withdraw support to the government. Maoist Centre (MC) and Nepali Congress (NC), along with other parties, had expected PM Oli to resign from his post immediately after submitting the formal information of withdrawal of support. But Oli has made public his determination that he would not meekly resign but face the parliament and leave the government through proper process. The PM who was elected through parliamentary voting process can quit the post through legal means and this is the best bet. It is but appropriate that Oli wants to respond to points in the no-confidence motion and desires to put challenges he faced during his tenure in record books.
On Speaker Onsari Gharti’s directions Parliament Secretariat has fixed the date from 21 to 23 July to discuss on no-confidence motion against Oli government. Meanwhile, a way out can be found before that date if political parties make a new agreement or a new coalition following mutual consultations. If that fails to happen, the voting after discussion in the House can pass or reject the motion. But in closely following the latest developments it appears that Maoist and its new partner NC will be able to pass the motion and Oli government can be unseated. However, nothing can be claimed with certainty as yet.
MC and NC have agreed that after the ousting of Oli-led government the next government will be under the leadership of Prachanda. Government made with this process is said to make way for another government after nine months. If everything goes according to the plan, all three elections: local, provincial and general, will be conducted before January 2018 as stipulated in the constitution. A new phase of stability will start from there.
But circumstances are not rosy. Fundamentally constitution has been a controversial document. Promulgated in a hurry, the statute could not address certain sensitive issues. Those outside the Constituent Assembly elections and those dissatisfied with the constitution are still expressing their grievances. Leaders of top parties were focused on constitution promulgation at any cost and they realized the need for quick amendment to it. Further amendment is still being floated. In other words, leaders with mandate to prepare supreme law of the land showed lack of far-sightedness.
Giving a constitution with provisions that would be irrelevant within weeks or months of promulgation is blatantly deceiving the public. People are right to raise questions about lack of a credible basis for political stability even after 10 years of movement for restoration of democracy. Leaders have to shoulder the blame for failing to institutionalize alleged achievements of the movement.
No-trust motion is the immediate challenge. Adopting democratic norms means that this motion should be handled through discussion and voting in the parliament. After all, it is the universally accepted measure to establish political legality. This is why probably PM and CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli adopted the political strategy to go through the process.
Despite this, some ‘experts’ of constitutional law have shown ambiguities in law to suggest the PM that his minority government can remain in power on the basis of these loopholes. This legal nitty-gritty is not the proper solution to current political complexity. Consultants should not provide wrong suggestions that serve vested interests. The PM should rebuff such suggestions.

http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/find-middle-path/,"An uneasy situation has developed as Dr. Govinda KC who has been tirelessly fighting for cleansing medical education and health services organised a press meet on 26 June and accused Chief Commissioner of Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Lokman Singh Karki of overreaching his jurisdiction. KC has announced to sit in a fast-unto-death from 10 July to pressure the parliament for impeaching Karki.
KC has accused Karki of interfering in medical entrance examination of Kathmandu University and Karki has refuted this claim through CIAA spokesperson. While raising objection to KC’s expression, CIAA spokesperson commented that KC was guided with ill mentality. The commission has advised KC not to be a sponsored campaigner. It believes that KC is being mobilised by a group of people with vested interests. KC has not countered any of these claims.
Due to KC’s silence in this matter, people supporting him are in a fix. They are divided whether to back KC’s campaign or not. Meanwhile, Kathmandu University has informed that the said medical entrance examination was fairly conducted. University Dean Bhola Thapa told the media that after getting information of leaked questions CIAA team sprung into action and a group of experts prepared another set of questions in CIAA’s presence and the exams were conducted. Dean Thapa has clarified that there are no irregularities.
But Thapa’s statement should have been effective before Senate-member of that University Kedarbhakta Mathema’s resignation from his post on Tuesday. Likewise, it would have been better if six ex-vice chancellors including Mathema (who is ex-vice chancellor of Tribhuvan University as well) urged for parliamentary inquiry.
Good governance and Monitoring Committee of the parliament has pulled up Chief Commissioner Karki and Dr. KC to question about their ‘irresponsible reactions’. This matter has been handed over to the sub-committee.
It is not a good indication that a constitutional body and its chief is subject to such controversy. At a time when news about abuses of authority and corruption have been making headlines, a constitutional body responsible for monitoring and controlling such irregularities is in a defensive position. This development has disappointed people. Only those involved in accumulating illegal money through abuse of authority must have been elated with this development. Country and society may have to pay a huge price for this.
Dr Govinda KC has appealed to impeach Chief Commissioner Karki and other commissioners complicit with him. Constitution’s Article 238 has provided for impeachment. Anyone practicing freedom of expression as provided by the constitution can raise the issue of impeachment. But procedure stipulated in Article 101 makes it clear that impeachment motion can be passed in the parliament only by two-thirds majority. There is nothing to prove that Karki has seriously violated constitution and law and there is no ground for impeaching him. Such a practice has not taken place in Nepal as yet. Even in other democratic countries, this is rarely done. Dr KC’s hunger strike threat cannot convince two-third members of the parliament to proceed with impeachment motion.
Despite all this, Dr. KC is a person who has done selfless service to the country and led by example. He has been constantly raising voices against fake doctors playing with people’s lives. His campaign of discouraging the trend of profit-oriented health service has its heart in the right place. But KC should be alert about violation of people’s right to fundamental health services if he sits in hunger strike in hospital premises. Health practitioners and service seekers should not fear the potential of a dire situation created by the hunger strike.
We understand that purpose of both parties to the current dispute is maintaining quality in medical education and health service. For this, an environment of mutual agreement is required. Both sides should be flexible and opt for a middle way and work to free health sector of irregularities.
As an important constitutional body, CIAA should hold discussion with Dr. KC and try to address his complaints and interests. Meanwhile Dr. KC too should drop his rigid stance and show eagerness to sit in discussion process. Rigidity will not benefit anyone.

The wall abutting the school building caved in and buried two students in the classroom. Condolences and sympathies to families of the dead and injured have been pouring in from Nepal and abroad.
Education Minister Girirajmani Pokahrel immediately took interest in Taukhel incident. Lalitpur Chief District Officer Rishiram Sharma said that the land plotters who erected wall unsafely near the school despite opposition will be brought to justice. This commitment must have consoled the locals. Since this incident is related to taking of children’s lives by sheer negligence, those involved in it should be tried at the court with murder case and punished to the extent of law. Political parties and their sister organisations should not pressure anyone to commute the punishment for the accused. If there is any pressure from anyone, authorities should make them public so that such move will be resisted.
Everyone knows that land plotting is not limited to Lalitpur. Arable lands in other places have been plotted for residential purposes. Long-term solution to this problem lies in building a clear national policy of land use that determines residential area, industrial area, and arable land area. Not doing this immediately will put innocent lives in peril.

http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/mending-ties/,"If two latest publications from Indian foreign ministry are anything to go by, Indian government is eager to repair broken relationship with Nepal. One of the publications contains Indian Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s remarks that Nepal-India ties are as ancient as the Himalayas and Ganges. Right from the time of his ascent to the seat of power, Modi has adopted the policy of ‘neighbourhood first’.  And he came to Nepal within weeks of swearing-in. None of the Indian PMs had come to Nepal on a state visit for 17 years. Modi himself was uncomfortable with such a long gap in visiting a country that shares close social-cultural ties with India. Modi came to Nepal during SAARC summit as well.
But things turned worse all of a sudden and Nepal had to face economic blockade despite New Delhi’s claim that it had no enmity against Nepal. Nepalis had to face extreme difficulties as imports of even essential goods halted. Five months after the promulgation of constitution, Nepalis had to undergo harsh conditions due to the blockade. Nepal’s new constitution, a domestic matter, was the cause behind India’s unfriendly stance towards Nepal. Constitution promulgated in a hurry had been generating many discussions and controversies but that was Nepal’s internal challenge. Dissatisfaction against the statute was not limited to Tarai-Madhes. But New Delhi chose to ignore Nepal’s ground reality and India overstepped in internationalising Nepal’s internal affairs.
But it is history now. Famous publications mentioned above seem to have clarified that New Delhi has corrected its views on Nepal. It now takes Nepal’s new constitution as relevant in developing constitutional democratic process. Having accepted that issues to be resolved are Nepal’s internal matters, India has hoped that they will meet a logical conclusion soon. Thus, these new developments are positive. Only it needs to be seen how quickly and how heartily does this new thought get implemented. Efforts in normalising relationship will depend on it.
For now, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs needs to take this change of heart shown by New Delhi as an effort towards building favourable environment in bilateral ties. Future meetings of bilateral mechanisms will be guided by New Delhi’s stance in the meeting of ministerial level Nepal-India Joint Commission that is expected to start within few weeks. Conclusions of discussions among eminent persons from each country will provide initial hints towards this direction.

http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/merchants-of-death/,"Legal provisions make it mandatory that eligible people obtain driving licenses after completing necessary examinations and processes. Drivers with licenses acquired by normal process drive their vehicles with caution and are not usually involved in accidents. Especially, private vehicle owners are averse to any additional risk.
But data shows that road accidents in Nepal have been increasing over the years. Police Headquarters data shows that each year around 2,000 people die in road accidents. Many others are maimed and disabled in road rage. This is a worrying scenario.
It is state’s primary obligation to protect citizens’ life and it has to manage roads properly for minimum loss of life and property. Driving vehicles with bad engines, drivers’ negligence and unrepaired roads are some causes of accidents that can be easily prevented. That is why government bodies need to be responsible in preventing such accidents. Coordination among road department, transportation management department and traffic police will lessen road accidents. This coordination appears to be lacking.
Adding a horrible dimension to this worrying situation, fake driving license scam has come to public notice. The story on fake driving licenses carried out by Lokaantar yesterday exposes that 40,000 vehicles of all types have been plying Kathmandu roads with fake licenses. Gangs of fake license sellers are active. Chiefs of transportation offices and traffic police say that these gangs deliver fake licenses to the seekers’ doorsteps with a fee of minimum 10,000 rupees. Transportation and traffic police officers have indirectly corroborated the existence of illegal business of fake licenses.
This deadly business of fake driving licenses being allowed to run is beyond ordinary imagination. Continuation of such criminal activity under the watch of an elected government is a matter of worry. News report claims that many holders of fake licenses have gone abroad. Such fake licenses are in risk of cancellation by foreign governments and this will tarnish Nepal’s image. Just like European embargo on Nepal’ aeroplanes, this fake license scam will further isolate Nepal in international stage.
But it is unfortunate that the government has failed to take concrete steps at a time when circumstances have turned worse. That is why the government that appears to be alert about people’s comfort, have to give priority to safety of citizens’ life.

http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/curb-the-taliban/,"The attack on Nepali guards in a minibus in Kabul on 20 June has claimed 13 lives and left many wounded, leaving Nepal in tears. This atrocious incident has proved that the already fragile law and order situation in Afghanistan has further complicated. But Nepalis who had reached Afghanistan through private security companies had nothing to do with that country’s unstable internal politics. They were workers deployed for security of diplomatic agencies and missions from different countries in Kabul. Taliban leaders must have understood this reality and fatally attacked the vehicle carrying Nepalis. Thus this massacre of innocent people has to be condemned with strong words. Afghanistan’s international image has further been tarnished with this violent attack.
Nepalis working in high-risk condition in Afghanistan say that security service companies deploying them as security guards have not taken adequate care about their safety. Guerrilla attacks like the one that killed Nepalis would not have taken place if the guards were put in bulletproof vehicles or escorted by security agents. This aspect of negligence in security management’s part has to be investigated at the government level.
Another point to be made in this context is the assessment of risks to be made by Nepali workers abroad. Workers should be alert about potential risks and challenges in foreign jobs, meaning that they should decide to go for abroad employment only after getting information from office concerned. Safety is utmost priority and workers should be cautious about frauds. Salaries and perks for working in war-zones like Afghanistan and Iraq are attractive but that attraction cannot be more important than one’s life. Nepalis can earn their living in Nepal, provided they stop dreaming of luxurious lives and keep their necessities at the minimum. Opportunities for agriculture works and other means of self-employment are in plenty in the country even if political situation is unstable.
Kabul and other areas in Afghanistan have suffered violent revolts for a long time. The West, especially the US, has spent billions to bring stability and governance in Afghanistan hoping that it would contribute to lessen terrorist activities across the world. The US has provided military assistance to government security agencies in Afghanistan who have been trained by American experts. But still Afghan security mechanism has not been able to provide terror-free environment for Afghanis and migrant workers. Therefore, western powers involved in bringing stability in Afghanistan cannot shirk off their responsibilities before circumstances get better.

Lead investigator Nabaraj Silwal has assured the public that arrest and prosecution of these doctors has been carried out on the basis of proper investigation and evidence. Kathmandu District Court has remanded these 16 ‘doctors’ to custody for five days pending further investigation.
These ‘doctors’ with insufficient academic qualifications had taken license to examine patients, prescribe medicines and do surgeries, thereby played with people’s health. Many patients might have lost their lives at the hands of these doctors with no qualifications and skills. Many others might have become disabled. Thus, it is a serious crime against humanity. It is state’s duty to find out the root cause behind this scam. The court is also expected to look into these issues during trial.
All accused have to be presumed innocent until proved guilty. But Nepal Medical Association’s objection against the police arresting fake doctors is surprising. Association chief Dr. Anjani Kumar Jha, in one radio interview, said that these doctors should not have been arrested; cancellation of their license by Nepal Medical Council (NMC) would have been enough. But is it such a simple issue? Revoking license of a quack is not sufficient punishment just like a driver cannot be let off with mere cancellation of license for killing people in road accident.
But questions should be raised as to why these doctors facing trial were allowed to study at the MBBS level without properly examining their secondary and intermediate level certificates. NMC also could have scrutinised their academic credentials while taking license examinations. It goes without saying that qualified, experienced and renowned doctors are responsible for these exams. High-level officers at Education Ministry and Health Ministry are also involved in it. Does this mean they have failed in fulfilling their responsibilities? Or were they involved in corruption? Answers to these questions need to be searched. Authorities concerned should take initiatives in delving into this issue.

Jail terms of up to five years could be imposed on people in Nepal who post “offensive” comment on social media sites, including Facebook and Instagram in the latest move by the government to crack down on dissent.
The information technology bill, introduced at the end of December, imposes fines of up to 1.5m rupees (about $13,000) for anyone posting content deemed to promote hate crime or ridicule. It would apply to all social networking sites.
Last month the ruling Nepal Communist party (NCP) also tabled a “special service bill” that would allow the National Investigation Department to collect information without a warrant or court order.
The information technology bill is expected to be debated by MPs this month. Critics fear it will pass with ease because the NCP holds a majority in parliament.
The Electronic Transaction Act (ETA), passed in 2008 to fight cybercrime, has already been used to restrict online comment. Critics say the new law will further curtail free speech.
Arjun Giri, an editor at the online news portal Tandav News, was detained for four days last April under the ETA after writing a story alleging fraud against a powerful local businessman that was shared on Facebook.
“I got a shocking call after a few days from the local police. Police took me into custody, citing that I violated the Electronic Transaction Act,” Giri said.
Other journalists and activists raised the alarm over his detention. “If media and journalists did not raise their voices for me I would have been in jail now,” he said. “This government is misusing its power and becoming a dictator.”
More recently the rapper Samir Ghising, also known as VTEN, was jailed for a week under the act for “antisocial, vulgar and derogatory language, and spreading the wrong message in society in his songs”.
Comedian Pranesh Gautam was jailed for nine days in June for critiquing a film on his YouTube channel.
According to Freedom Forum, 38 journalists were arrested, detained or questioned by police in 2019. Taranath Dahal, the forum’s director, said: “The situation is sinister. If the proposed bill becomes law, the media and journalist[s] will be the most targeted.
“We are living in the digital era and we will not be allowed to give our opinions, or speak and express our feelings, due to fear of a heavy fine and jail punishment, which will promote self-censorship. That means there will be no public debate.
But Kalyani Kumari Khadka, chairman of the development and technology committee, which introduced the legislation, said: “These clauses on the bill are extremely needed because our society is going out of control.”
Earlier attempts to restrict press freedoms met with protests that eventually forced the government to row back. But journalist and former newspaper editor Dhruba Hari Adhikary said the situation remained “very dangerous”.
“Both parliamentary bills, if allowed to become law, will adversely affect citizens’ constitutional rights relating to freedom of opinion and expression. The direct effect of [proposed] restrictive provisions will be on journalists, but the ultimate impact will be on people as a whole. Their right to be informed citizens of the country is being curbed for no fault of theirs.
“Constitutionally, Nepal is a democratic country, not a communist country like North Korea. So, the present ruling party cannot – and must not – be allowed to make laws which seek to dilute the norms and values cherished in a democratic society.”

Kathmandu, 15 November (2019) – Inspector General of Police Sarbendra Khanal has made his career as a competent police office ever since he entered the police force as an inspector. But in two years at the helm of the force, his image has tarnished.
Khanal carefully built up his positive image in the police for 28 years but blemished it after becoming the IGP. Top police officers have commented that due to the IGP’s problematic working style, credibility and respect for the police force has taken a hit.
“Laborious police officers did not get due credit. They toiled hard but he took all the credit. As the police chief, it is his responsibility to promote the worthy officers,” one officer expressed his dissatisfaction. “His activities have dented the confidence of the junior officers.”
Khanal is to retire after three months but his tenure towards the end is subject to criticism. Organizational slump and erosion of personal image is difficult to recover in these three months. Some of the cases have dragged police force into controversy under Khanal’s leadership.
Nirmala Pant murder case
Handling the case of the brutal murder of teenager Nirmala Pant in Kanchanpur district in Farwestern Province speaks volumes about IGP Khanal’s failure. Sixteen months have passed since the incident occurred but the culprits are still at large.
Nirmala Pant’s half-naked body was found on July 27, 2018 in a sugarcane field. On August 20, 2018 the police made one Dilip Singh Bista public proclaiming him to be the chief accused.
This case courted huge controversy with accusations that the police had tampered with the evidence at the site of murder. Dilip Singh Bista was said to be tortured in custody to confess to Pant’s murder. But Bista had to be freed after his DNA did not match with the artefacts in the crime scene. Although IGP Khanal boasted that the police force will bring a closure to the incident, it never happened.
Kumar Poudel’s fake encounter
The police killed one Kumar Poudel belonging to Nepal Communist Party (Biplav Outfit) in an encounter in Sarlahi district in eastern Tarai. National Human Rights Commission investigated into the incident and recommended the government to take action against the implicated police officers.
The Commission’s recommendation report clearly mentions that the incident is not an encounter but murder in cold blood and there are errors in post-mortem report from a medico-legal perspective.
The Commission has recommended the government to suspend Inspector Krishna Dev Prasad Sah as well as Police Constables Binod Sah and Satya Nayaran Mishra but they have not been suspended yet. Experts say that Poudel “encounter” has dented IGP Khanal’s image.
CIAA raids Police Headquarters
On September 6, 2019 a special team of the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) raided the Police Headquarters in Naxal and took last two years’ documents in control. Suspecting irregularities, the CIAA has taken away original documents about procurement of uniform, vehicles and other goods.
CIAA taking away the papers from Police Headquarters suspecting corruption is being taken as IGP Khanal’s failure.
Hobnobbing with the powerful
Besides failure in these emblematic cases, IGP Khanal is known for hobnobbing with the powerful people. He is known to cosy up with the political party in power.
His closeness with Nepali Congress party is public knowledge but of late he made connections with Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”.  The Congress party was about to make Rajendra Man Shrestha the DIG but he had to be hospitalized for paralysis. With Shrestha out of the picture, Khanal was the only candidate with the backing of Nepali Congress and he stood first in the promotion to the post of DIG.
Afterwards, he secured Prachanda’s support to become the IGP even if he did not have warm relationship with the then UML.

Kathmandu, 19 April (2019) – Amnesty International Nepal submitted today Amnesty International’s analysis of Nepal’s new law on the right to food and food sovereignty to the Agriculture and Livestock Development Minister Chakra Pani Khanal.
Amnesty International emphasizes that Nepal must strengthen and implement its new law on the right to food in order to meet its commitments to rid the country of hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity.
A delegation consisting of Amnesty Internationl Nepal’s Board Chair Bikram Dhukuchhu and representatives from Community Self Rlinace Center (CSRC) and JuRI Nepal submitted the analysis paper to Minister Khanal at the latter’s office in Singha Durbar today.
Amnesty International’s briefing Analysis of the Right to Food and Food Sovereignty Act recommends for the law to be amended. It suggests that rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of the law need to be crafted sooner.
The briefing  was made public on 4 April 2019 amidst a programme with representatives from Nepal’s civil society, National Human Rights Commission and media.
Background:
Hunger was one of the root causes of Nepal’s decade-long internal conflict, and it continues to be felt across the country today. Nearly half of all households in Nepal face food insecurity, and a tenth are “severely food insecure”. More than a half of all children under five years of age are anaemic, while more than a third of them suffer from stunted growth.
In an important step towards realizing its goal of “zero hunger” by 2025, the Nepal government brought the Right to Food and Food Sovereignty Act 2018 into force last September.

In a bid to embark upon the agenda of civil service reform, which remains a cherished goal of our democracy, the Constitution has established a Public Service Commission at the centre and State Public Service Commission at the provincial level.
The government has recently tabled a bill in the House to determine the basis and standards related to the constitution, work, duty and rights of Provincial Civil Service Commission. Nevertheless, the bill incorporates a plethora of provisions to ensure a huge say of the Centre. This goes against the federal fabrics of our Constitution, say the stakeholders and experts.
As per Section 3 of the Bill, state civil service officers will have to face the written examination, interview, or the other assessments prescribed by the state public service commission. The provision empowers the states to conduct the written test for the recruitment of state police forces.
Section 7 envisages that the candidates appearing for the public service examinations in the provinces shall write papers in the official language of the federal government. Article 7 (1) of the Constitution says that the Nepali language written in Devanagari script shall be the language of official business in Nepal.  On the other hand, Article 7(2) provisions that a province shall select one or more national languages (in addition to Nepali) as the language of official business.
This way, “The bill grossly fails to quicken the pulse of linguistic diversity as well as federal principles. It reflects the unitary mind set of the state,” said Surendra Mahato, a senior advocate at the Supreme Court of Nepal, in an interaction programme organised by Kathmandu University School of Law Dhulikhel on Friday in Kathmandu. He further said that the bill appears to be originated from the centralised mind set of bureaucracy which prefers accumulation of power over the devolution of power.
At this background, it bears relevance to discuss the practice adopted by India. In India, the candidates are allowed to use any one language from the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution or English or the official language of the state as the medium of examination in different public service commission examinations.  The Eighth Schedule of Constitution lists 22 languages that include Nepali, Maithili and Hindi.
“This bill deserves to be modified from the very preamble to the concluding provision as it miserably fails to address the basic federal principles envisaged in our Constitution,” further said Mahato. He was also of the opinion that the provisions in bill offer minimal autonomy to the provinces which would ultimately foil the creativity of the second tier governments. “The provisions demonstrate that the states are merely the implementing agencies of the policies formulated by the Centre.”
Mahato added that a federal state ought to foster diversity “but this bill seeks to nurture uniformity.”
However, Dr Bharat Raj Gautam, main speaker in the programme, was of the view that the provision relating to language in bill is in furtherance of the Constitution and the principles and standards laid-down by the Public Service Commission (PSC). “The candidates appearing the examinations of the State Public Service Commission (SPSC) ought to write papers in Nepali or English. This provision would maintain uniformity and advance the standards and norms of the PSC,” said he. He claimed that the bill establishes sufficient nexus with the federal principles enshrined under the 2015 Constitution.
Gautam further said that the bill ought to have ensured the representation of women in composition of State Public Service Commission envisaged under Section 3. “Initially, this bill should be taken as an instrument supporting the ‘standards and principles’ of the PSC,” said Gautam.
But, “The bill does not shed light on those ‘standards and principles’ of the PSC,” said Mahato, adding, “This bill is not in the line with the constitutional spirits.”
Seconding the view of Mahato, Mangal Bahadur Menyangbo, an advocate, said that the bill seeks to confer power on limited hands which neither supports the federal principles nor address the concerns of marginalised communities. “It reflects the unitary mind set of the state.”
Likewise, Ang Dawa Sherpa, a former lawmaker, said that the bill lacks provisions to supplement the federal fabrics of the Republic. “The bill ought to have addressed the linguistic and cultural diversity and conferred power on the SPSC to discharge functions without consulting the PSC,” said she.
At this backdrop, Dr Surya Dhungel, a senior advocate and an eminent expert of Constitutional Law, said that it’s high time to understand that the grant of provincial autonomy does not necessarily enable the centrifugal forces to take root. “Those who oppose federalism by advocating a strong centre have never understood the beauty of the devolution power,” added he.
Section 9 of bill prescribes that the SPSC will consult the PSC while drafting the policies relating to the public services. The SPSC is also required to take the PSC into confidence while initiating departmental inquiries or promotions of the staffs in service.
Also, the bill says that the PSC shall always be consulted while formulating the policies regarding the appointment and promotion of police staffs in state. This way, the states are offered minimal say which secures a federation with strong centralising tendencies.
However, in India, a SPSC discharges all those functions in respect of the State Services as does the Union Commission in relation to the Union Services.
The speakers in the programmes stressed on the need of maintaining diversity than uniformity in the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. “The centralised decision-making tendencies in a federation can tarnish the federal republican character of the state by suppressing the local concerns and introducing inadequacies which are not favourable to our federalism,” said Lal Babu Yadav, a former Constituent Assembly member.

There was a time, known as the laissez faire era, when the state was chiefly concerned with the maintenance of law and order and defence of the country against external aggression, war or armed conflict. Such a restrictive concept of the state no longer exists.
The architects of the Constitution of Nepal realised that political democracy would be useless in absence of economic democracy. It is heartening that Nepal has adopted a plethora of economic, social and cultural rights as fundamental rights with a view to uplift socio-economic condition of the national population.
Unlike the United States, Nepal has already ratified International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). “The economic, social and cultural rights could be characterised as basics to our social order as they intend to build a just society. These rights play an instrumental role in achieving socio-economic revolution to end poverty, ignorance, disease and inequality of opportunity,” said Hari Phuyal, former Attorney General and a senior advocate at Supreme Court, in an interaction programme jointly organized by Law and Policy Forum for Social Justice (LAPSOJ) and iProbono on Tuesday in Kathmandu.
He further said that the horizons of the fundamental rights would shrink in absence of economic, social and cultural rights.
Barun Ghimire, iProbono Nepal Legal Analyst, said that the judiciary is also a part of welfare state in Nepal. “The Supreme Court of Nepal has decided on number of occasions to promote social welfare policies. There are ample rights which were part of directive principles in yesteryears but now they have been introduced under fundamental rights by virtue of robust judicial activism and judicial creativity,” he said.
“It’s advisable for the judicial department to champion the cause of public welfare by interpreting the economic, social and cultural rights in the light of civil and political rights and other human rights. Such an attempt would not only maintain rule of law but also foster constitutionalism,” further said Ghimire, who also teaches Law at Chakrabati College of Law, Kathmandu.
Anurag Devkota, Programme Coordinator at LAPSOJ, argued that the scope of fundamental rights would be further widened at times when the state and judicial department both starts believing that there is no anti-thesis between civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights.
He further said that it’s imperative for the government to uphold economic, social and cultural rights in order to widen the scope of human rights and avoid the violation of international obligations.
While explaining the provisions of Consumer Protection Act, 2018, Alok Pokharel, a lecturer of Constitutional Law, said, “Section 6 (5) prescribes that labelling is not required for goods that are sold openly such as fruits, vegetable. However, its proviso requires that there should be labelling in fruits and vegetable imported to Nepal. This is something difficult to be regulated considering Nepal’s open and often unregulated border with India.”
He further said that there are regular instances, when traders and individuals bring in materials including fruits and vegetable informally escaping custom and trade regulations. “In addition, fruits and vegetable brought from Taplejung and Bajura, among remotest districts of Nepal, to major cities like Kathmandu, Biratnagar and Dhangadhi can be exempted from labelling, but the same brought from nearby cities like Raxaul, Jogbani and Gauriphanta of India, which are even closer than Taplejung and Bajura to such major cities should have labels.”
Pokharel added that Section 6 of the Act requires that labelling in goods shall be done in English and Nepali languages but it ignores the majority population of Nepal who have local dialects and who do not speak or understand English and Nepali languages. Also, “Section 11 has the provision on obligation of seller/vendor, but the Act does not define who the sellers/vendors are. It is very likely that street sellers/vendors are exempted from the obligations of the Act unless otherwise specified.”
Likewise, Mariam Faruqi, director of iProbono’s South Asia regional projects based in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh, said that the object of their intervention is to empower Nepali lawyers to develop tools to promote and protect economic, social and cultural rights. “Capacity building of young lawyers is also on the agenda. We would also like to work on the next project and consider regional approach to enhancing litigation relating to core rights,” she said.
Kalyan Pokharel, executive member at the Supreme Court Bar Association, was of the opinion that Right to food and food sovereignty Act, 2018 is a welcome legislation which aims to foster the cause of socio-economic democracy. “This Act encourages the central, provincial and local bodies to take (joint) initiatives in limiting the complexities coming in the way of food sovereignty. If we don’t have sufficient food productivity, then we will have to face scores of socio-economic problems.  Ultimately, we would fail to ensure food sovereignty. This legislation seeks to ensure food sovereignty.”
Jivesh Jha, a guest faculty at Kathmandu University School of Law Dhulikhel, said that Right to free and compulsory education Act, 2018 lacks provisions to control the monopoly of private school mafias. “In this way, Nepal’s Act falls short of adopting any measures to regulate the private school fees. So, balancing the independence of private institutions and public welfare functions has become a controversial issue.”
The speakers in the program stressed on the need of carrying out human rights agendas actively for the development of the country.

Nepal’s Supreme Court has ordered the government not to construct any new roads inside Chitwan National Park without approval from UNESCO, park authorities and other stakeholders.
Chitwan National Park is home the world’s second-largest population of greater one-horned rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis) as well as a significant population of Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris), 54 other mammal species and more than 550 varieties of birds. Chitwan’s extraordinary biodiversity led to its inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984.
However, plans to construct road and rail links passing through the park alarmed conservationists, and in 2017 landed Nepal with a formal warning from UNESCO that moving forward with the proposed projects could put Chitwan on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
Following the UNESCO warning, plans to develop the proposed East-West Electric Railway and Terai-Hulaki Highway were put on hold. The court’s verdict, issued following a Feb. 13 hearing, means that the government now has no choice but to accept the terms UNESCO puts forward for these projects.
According to the details of the court order, released Feb. 14, the judges held that building a road through the park without UNESCO approval would violate international treaties and agreements to which Nepal is party. The court said the planned projects can be built only after their environmental impact assessments are approved by Chitwan National Park, UNESCO and other stakeholders.
The court also noted that its attention had been drawn to another warning issued by UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee in October 2018, via a letter not made publicly available, detailing the committee’s requirements for an environmental impact assessment.
The verdict came in response to a petition originally filed in 2012 by lawyer Ramchandra Simkhada, who had requested a court order to halt the construction of the 30-kilometer (19-mile) East-West Highway because it would pass through the habitat of endangered animals and plants.

In resource-constrained country like Nepal, where the state actors face challenges in addressing socio-economic problems faced by the national population, the role of civil society organizations becomes crucial in promoting the grassroots-level participation for sensitizing the democratic process.
However, the presence of stringent laws to regulate and monitor or dictate the business of non-government sectors could create hurdles in responding the growing needs of the population at marginalized sections or grassroots level.
In this light, legal professionals, academicians, researchers and other stakeholders have raised their serious concerns over the draft of Social Organizations Act recently submitted by Nepal Law Commission to the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. The speakers said that the government was planning to regulate, dictate and control the avenues of the non-government organizations (NGOs) under restrictive laws.
“This is a very important bill which needs to be discussed among the civil society stakeholders, including NGOs and other organizations, be it ‘Aama Samuh’ [mother’s group] or similar groups engaged with agriculture sector, working at the grassroots.  The basic problem with the bill is that it seeks to focus on the control and supervision than on how to promote the civic space for creative and constructive use,” said Dr Bipin Adhikari, Dean, Kathmandu University School of Law, Dhulikhel.
He further said that the bill is home to very strange provisions. “There are certain provisions which empower the state to prosecute the civil society groups under espionage laws and try the NGOs for criminal offences, including breach of peace. It’s not pragmatic to incorporate criminal liabilities in this bill as we have a fair corpus of laws to deal with criminal offences or the situations influencing the national security,” argued Dr Adhikari while addressing the interaction program organized by Kathmandu University School of Law, Dhulikhel on Tuesday.
“We must strike optimum balance when deciding what and how to regulate. The laws should create conducive atmosphere, not restrictive ones, for the government and NGOs to operate in close cooperation in a bid to reap better outcomes,” added he.
The bill contains provisions to regulate corruption as well. “Corruption is an issue for the state as it involves misuse or abuse of public power. NGOs may be engaged in mismanagement of resources and they could be prosecuted for the same but not necessarily in abuse of state’s power. So, it’s unjust to put NGOs and government sectors on the same footing and charge them for corruption. Importantly, we have laws to deal with mismanagement of property or resources,” he added.
Similarly, anti-corruption crusader Kedar Khadka said, “This bill is in want of modifications. There are ample provisions which are unreasonable and restrictive in nature. If this bill takes the shape of law, it would frustrate the genuine voices of the civic societies in one or some other way.” He further said that the government (under the garb of law) wants to control rather than facilitate the civil societies.
Another speaker Kiran Kumari Gupta, a Supreme Court advocate, was of the opinion that the bill seeks to over-regulate the business of NGOs. “The NGOs could be engaged at planning and implementation level, which is still lacking for which the government carries greater responsibility. The current bill would certainly frustrate the working style of the two sectors [i.e., government and NGOs] that ought to be reconciled for the greater benefits of the populace,” further said she.
Pabitra Raut, faculty of Law at Nepal Law Campus, Kathmandu, opined that it’s contradictory in itself to give space to right-based organizations or development partners and endorse stringent controlling mechanism both at the same time. “The current bill acknowledges a good deal of provisions to stifle the genuine concerns of civil societies. It’s more or less conferring arbitrary powers on the government to regulate the non-governmental sectors,” added she.
Likewise, Dr Surya Dhungel, an eminent expert of Constitutional Law, said, “A clause seeks to regulate the networks of Nepal’s NGOs spread outside the country. How is it feasible? How practical is it for the Nepal’s NGOs to operate its business in the line with the legal ambits of other countries?”
He said that the government was planning to suppress the concern of right-based civil societies by invoking derogatory laws. “These types of laws would not provide enabling environment for the NGOs.”
The speakers in the programme, which saw the presence of stakeholders and advocates, argued that the bill is couched in a language which requires the civil societies to dance at the tune of the government of the day. They stressed on the need of amending restrictive provisions for the cause of liberal democracy.

On 25 August 2018, Law and Policy Forum for Social Justice (LAPSOJ) and Asian Human Rights and Culture Development Forum jointly registered a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) demanding an order to enact and implement effective law to ensure effective implementation of the Free Visa Free Ticket policy of the government.

National Planning Commission (NPC) has faced battery of questions on its relevance after the progress of the national pride projects was slow off the mark. During the 43rd meeting of the national development problems solution committee, the Prime Minister and Ministers questioned the NPC’s role and relevance after hearing the miserable progress of the development projects in the country.
“What’s the meaning of NPC which has failed to suggest plan, make amendments, point out weakness, and show methods of solution,” PM KP Sharma Oli wondered in the meeting. He vented the ire that it was not good to have NPC’s suggestion as if these are the mantras chanted by traditional shaman.
To the NPC, which has been contributing to country’s policy making and budgeting for six decades, the PM added the huge reform was needed in it
Similarly, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health and Population, Upendra Yadav, said as per the NPC there was 50 percent progress in the last 30 years in the national pride project. In more than a decade, the construction of postal highway made 25 percent success. “At such situation, what’s the relevance of NPC? I can debate for hours on it, we are backtracking,” he argued, why and where we failed to set development priority.
Unless health and education are improved, prosperity is not possible, according to him.
Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supplies Matrika Prasad Yadav said the slogan, ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ could not be feasible from the present ‘wrong’ working style regarding project selection.
The NPC team led by its vice-chairman Dr Pushpa Raj Kandel, is preparing to formulate the 15th National Plan and reviewing the 14th five-year plan.
Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Bhanubhakta Dhakal said he was surprised by the report presented that there was no problem in the government ministries directly concerned with the public in the context of public complaint of lack of good governance in the country linking with corruption and bureaucratic red tape.
Education and Technology Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel stressed on the need of clear work plan to mobilize resources and human resources.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Pradip Gyawali said there is the need of constructive intervention and a project bank to remove the problems resulting from lack of inter-ministry coordination in connection to taking forward the infrastructure development projects.
Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Management, Raghuveer Mahaseth warned that his ministry would start carrying out works in its own way if it did not get the response from NPC on time regarding its requests to address the problems seen in course of project implementation.
Labour and Employment Minister Gokarna Bista underlined the need of identifying the problem and locating it in the construction of development infrastructures in order to address it. He also stressed on inter-ministry level coordination in the design and implementation of development projects.
The meeting highlighted selection of development projects on the basis of their appropriateness and not on the influence of some leaders or access to power in the backdrop of the most of the projects not meeting the target. RSS

Bardibas, 12 Aug (2018) – “Sir, you know, I’m split! I’m a dead man.” It is what a 59-year old-man from Khopi Bairiya of Aurahi Municipality-6 from Mahottari district is found repeating before the group of people and offices seeking justice.
It sounds unbelievable. But, yes, he is the one- Ramsewak Raya Yadav bearing the ‘certificate of his death’ and running from pillar to posts- from the relatives’ homes to government offices and political party leaders. He even nags the unknown persons with his plight.
Ramsewak shared with media persons, “I met everyone- chief district officer, people’s representatives and political leaders and police persons. I’m tired of telling them this story. But, none helped me correct the fake certificate that mentions my death. However, I don’t quit my struggle for justice.”
After the death of mother at teenage, he left home for the job in Punjab, India, leaving behind wife in 1991. As he did not return home for long, the wife too ditched him, getting married to another fellow.
Taking advantage of this tragedy, his step mother and step brother pressed his father Rambrikshya to register for his (Ramwewak) death certificate in May 2011- twenty years after his departure from home. The death certificate was a solid document for the step mother Sakunti Devi and step brother Ram Pukar to immediately transfer his property under their ownership.
As per the registration, his death was occurred in October 2010.

The registration employee or the then VDC secretary Gopal Pathak has signed on Ramsewak’s death certificate.
To this injustice, neighbour Ram Prasad Raya also said it was revealed now that his step mother and step brother exerted pressure on his father to make such document. When he came to home a year back, he was completely a strange to the family.
His mother Kaushilya Devi had registered 15 kattha of land under his name. As this land now amounts tens of thousands rupees, the stepfamily hoodwinked him.
Poor Ramwewak adds, “My father died and the step mother and step brother said they did not know me.” He wipes out the runnel of tears from his cheek and laments, “Homeless, I’m taking shelter at a temple, and eating by begging in the village.”
When Chief District Officer Umesh Kumar Dhakal was asked about this problem, he replied, “Those registering for the death certificate of anyone living is punished as per the law. Because the Local Development Officer is currently out of office for some special reason, this problem will be addressed by investigating the documents.”
The legal practitioners here also said even a legal case could be filed against those involving in making such fake document and return the share of the property to the right owner. Initially, the office preparing the certificate can itself revoke the fake documentation, added advocate Uddhav Chhetri. RSS

http://english.lokaantar.com/interview/national-unity-led-qatars-resilience-blockade-imposed-neighbors-yousuf-bin-mohamed-qatars-ambassador-nepal-interview/,"Yousuf Bin Mohamed Ahmed Al- Hail who was appointed to the ambassadorial post here in November 2016 says national unity is the indispensable pillar to overcome national obstacles. Qatar a key to global labour market faced diplomatic crises with neighbours a couple of years back has now completely come to the position of self-reliance.
Coinciding with Qatar’s backdrop and magical self-reliance including various labour issues Lokaantar talked with him about the issues related to the bilateral diplomatic relation.
Here goes an edited excerpt of the interview:
What is Qatar’s take on four decades long diplomatic ties with Nepal?
I would say that the bilateral relations between the State of Qatar and Nepal have been developing well during these four decades, as the State of Qatar is keen to develop relations with Nepal in various fields through signing of agreements in various fields to strengthen cooperation in a formal way between our two governments.
We’ve achieved positive steps and aspire to realize more in order to further strengthen relations, we have important agreements we seek to sign, including the amendment of the labor agreement of 2005, the first labor agreement signed by Nepal with another country, and then the agreement on cooperation in the field of health as well as we seek to sign an agreement to protect investments. The two countries have high level of cooperation at the international forums and UN organizations arena through mutual support as well as our sharing the same views on global issues and adherence to international conventions.
How will Qatar as a friendly nation help Nepal achieve the goal of “Happy Nepali, Prosperous Nepal”? Is there any chance of Qatari investors investing in Nepal’s hydroelectricity, tourism and infrastructure development?
First of all, I would like to say that we are pleased with Nepal’s achievements at the political level since the CPA in 2006, the promulgation of the Constitution in 2015, the success of the general elections in 2017, and the achievement of political stability. We are ready to cooperate with Nepal in the field of agriculture, energy and other investments. We appreciate the efforts of the Government and the Investment Authority in the field of reform and the relevant of laws. We also seek to sign important agreements to enhance economic cooperation.
We are seeking to enhance cooperation between the two countries in various fields. I have been calling on Nepali business sectors to cooperate with Qatar in order to increase trade exchange and activate the joint chamber MoU by participating in various exhibitions in the State of Qatar and inviting Qatari companies to visit Nepal to explore investment opportunities.
Nepal is celebrating 2020 as Visit Nepal Year. What role will the embassy play in making Visit Nepal campaign successful? How will it inspire Qatari tourists to visit Nepal?
Visit Nepal 2020 campaign will be launched globally in January 2020 in various countries including Qatar. We welcome the campaign and the efforts to promote tourism in Nepal and we believe in the tremendous potential of Nepal in the field of tourism that is rarely available in any other country in the world, and there is a huge boom in the hospitality sector I would like to assure you that the number of Qatari tourists is constantly increasing compared to previous years, especially in the field of mountaineering. I would like to indicate that Nepal has an opportunity for medical and therapeutic tourism which should be well promoted in the Gulf countries.
Qatar is Nepali migrant laborers’ favorite destination country. How do you assess the condition of Nepali migrant workers in Qatar?
The State of Qatar has made tremendous steps in the field of labor during the last period, where it has amended the Labor Law and ended the sponsorship system, ensured the freedom for the worker to change the employer without the need to leave the country, made the official dealing with residence card and not the passport, obliged companies to deposit salaries through banks, formed a court in the Ministry of Labor to settle disputes, provide medical and recreational services to workers as well as other important and continuous steps within the framework of recognition of the role of Nepali workers in the State of Qatar.
Certainly there are problems in this sector, some of them because of illegal manpower offices and the problem of Azad visa and trafficking agents. We appreciate the role of the government and civil society organizations in confronting these challenges because we believe that migrant workers are important for the benefit of both countries and therefore their rights should be preserved and protected.We are seeking to amend and sign the bilateral labor agreement of 2005.There is a joint committee for that purpose.
The State of Qatar opened the Qatar Visa center QVC with the purpose of supporting migrant labor and we thank the Government of Nepal for its cooperation.
What is Qatar’s perspective on Nepali workers? Has Qatar developed any plans to create more jobs ahead?
I would like to emphasize that the Nepali workers enjoy the respect and appreciation of the leadership of the State and the Qatari people because of their integrity, sincerity and dedication and their reflection of the high ethics of Nepali nation.
The State of Qatar adopts Vision 2030 where it plans for other major projects and would like to continue this cooperation it’s our intention to carry on further after the FIFA world cup 2022.
How did Qatar achieve such enviable economic prosperity in such a short period? What is the secret of Qatar’s resilience in face of adversity from its neighbors in the form of blockade?
The top leadership of State of Qatar has a clear vision, which focused on the development and prosperity of the people, and supervised the elaboration of strategies and plans to the optimum use of national resources in cooperation with strong international partnerships, and attracted high expertise and skills in a number of fields.
I would like to indicate to the strong sense of unity among His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the ruling family and the Qatari people this led to intensive efforts by the Qatari citizen to promote the country into higher levels, therefore you find that the development of the State of Qatar is an ongoing process, this national unity that already exists is very useful for the country at the time of the blockade and it is known that during crises, national unity is the indispensable pillar to overcome obstacles, then the State of Qatar is oriented towards self-reliance. Consequently, in the year of the blockade it has become stronger and managed to produce many food products compared to its dependence on food imports in the past.
What are Qatar’s preparations for the Football World Cup 2022? Why do you think the western media portray Qatar in a poor light surrounding world cup preparations?
Most of the preparations have been completed and some stadiums have been officially opened and you know that the State of Qatar hosted the GCC Football Competition with the participation of all teams. His Highness the Amir welcomed all the spectators and participants from neighboring countries, and the Qatari people love football.
I would like to thank the Nepali workers for their cooperation in establishing sports facilities. What is sometimes mentioned in the Western media I think that it is not updated with the great developments that took place in the State of Qatar and I’ve referred to earlier which has been recognized by the competent international bodies such as the International Labor Organization, which has an office in the State of Qatar and we have joint initiatives and projects in this regard.
What is the probability of high-level visit of Qatari officials to Nepal?
The Embassy attaches great importance to high-level visits which is considered as one of the important steps in strengthening bilateral relations between the two countries. We are delighted and honored by the visit of Rt. Hon. Mrs. Bydia Devi Bhandari, President of the Republic of Nepal to the State of Qatar last November, which was fruitful and successful and will be followed by other visits. We will exert our efforts to have such visits from our side also, which push bilateral cooperation to broader horizons.
We have a joint working committee at the foreign ministry level to discuss political affairs, I assure you of the keenness of the State of Qatar to carry out such visits, which will develop bilateral cooperation to broader horizons.
To conclude, do you want to convey any message on the occasion of Qatar’s national day?
On the occasion of the National Day of the State of Qatar, I would like to extend my congratulations to His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Government and people of the State of Qatar, and I express my deepest greetings to the friendly people and Government of Nepal and wish to achieve their aspirations of development, prosperity and happiness.
I see this quite close as Nepal is already embarking on a process of change towards development compared to previous years. We are ready to talk, consult and actually cooperate, and always hope to see Nepal prosperous, safe and stable.

http://english.lokaantar.com/interview/amazon-wildfire-global-emergency/,"Avishee Dahal

The Amazon rainforest covers over half of the planet’s remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most bio-diverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species. Amazon wildfire is a global crisis threatening billions of trees and ecological diversity. It is high time conserve it. It is obvious that the surrounding areas suffer the most but ultimately no one will remain unaffected. It would be difficult to keep a balance of global temperatures without the world’s largest rainforest.
The Brazilian rainforest is caught in the middle between biodiversity and business for a long time now. Despite efforts to conserve while limiting the impacts of climate change, there has been evidence of worsened deforestation, drought lately causing an imbalance in the region. The New York Times reports, in June alone, when the cooler, drier season began and cutting trees became easier, the deforestation rate rose drastically, with roughly 80 percent more forest cover lost than in June of the previous year. The National Institute for Space Research (INPE) monitoring system registered destruction of 4,699 square kilometres this year.
A major driver of deforestation in the Amazon basin is soy cultivation. Global Forest Atlas mentions that seeds of soybean plant is rich in protein and 80 percent of Amazon soy is destined for animal feed; smaller percentages are used for oil or eaten directly. Brazil has 24-25 million hectares of land devoted to the growth of this crop which yields around 86.8 million metric tons of soybeans. It is currently the second largest producer of soybeans in the world following the US.

Tensions
The rainforest likely formed during the Eocene era (from 56 million years to 33.9 million years ago), is home to about 2.5 million insect species, tens of thousands of plants, and some 2,000 birds and mammals. Destruction of this region is a global concern and entails a global crisis. Brazilian state of Amazonas has declared a state of emergency over the rising number of fires in the region as it is the fourth most affected region, reports Euronews. Smoke emissions have grown thicker, even blocking sunlight from passing in the surface, almost blanketing half of Brazil with fumes. Smokes are even spilling into neighbouring Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, spreading into South Atlantic coast. The rainforest which contributes to the 20 percent of the Earth’s oxygen is burning at a record rate- 72,000 fires which is over 80 percent increase compared to the same period of the previous year according to Brazil’s research centre. Environmentalists warn that if the unprecedented burn leads to a point of no return, it could turn into dry Savanna and begin emitting carbon instead. Consequences of air pollution remain; as a ripple effect it could even harm agricultural productivity as the fumes settle on earth’s surface.
President’s response
Image credit: Isac Nóbrega/PR
According to Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) the fumes in wildfire is visible from space. Although tensions have spurred, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil who is indignant to international criticism argues that the figures are “lies”, accuses NGOs whose budgets have been cut to have started the fire, with no evidence. Furthermore, he adds that its use should not concern outsiders despite the alarming incident. After assuming the office, President had issued an open invitation to loggers and farmers to clear the land. Battling the President’s accusations, nonprofits have blamed Bolsonaro’s pro-development policies for sharp increase in Amazon deforestation.
The current government  is accused of “systematically dismantling Brazil’s environmental policy” by Danicley Aguiar of Greenpeace Brazil. The government has faced international pressure to protect the rainforest from illegal logging or mining activities. “I used to be called Captain Chainsaw, now I am Nero, setting the Amazon aflame,” the president said adding that Brazil lacks resources to fight the Amazon fire.
Fate of indigenous tribes 

Indigenous tribes are caught up in a battle between supporters of business and environmental protection and suffer direct consequences. More recently, an indigenous tribe from Ecuador had won a lawsuit against Big Oil, saving millions of acres of rainforest. Far-right leaders have been repeatedly attempting to offer them with incentives to give up the land in return for a “better life”. Power play in the region to illegally destroy land for cattle ranching and other agricultural ventures has burnt forests which is a home to 1 million indigenous people and 3 million species so far.
Amazon Basin is not burning alone 
The ongoing Amazon catastrophe is another emergency call after a series of wildfires in 2019. National Remote Sensing Centre of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) assessed the massive forest fires in February that broke out in numerous places across the Bandipur National Park of the Karnataka state in India and estimated the extent of burnt area to be about 10,920 acres five days. Another Asian disaster broke in Siberia where 3 million hectares were on fire by the end of July. Indonesian forest fire have been ongoing since early this year and getting worse with time.
Drought and hot temperature did not leave even the European region unaffected. United Kingdom has faced a series of 96 wildfires lasting from February to April. North American forests, Alberta, California, Washington State were also on fire this year. Wildfire Situation Summary Report published by Agriculture and Forestry – Forest Protection Division indicated that most of the incidents in Alberta were caused either by lightning or humans. Oceania too experienced fire more than twice the numbers from previous years. Australian bushfire season from 2017 has destroyed over 90 buildings. Two separate incidents of wildfire were witnessed in New Zealand. Large fire in Pigeon Valley, the country’s largest since 1955 were however under control.

Notable international efforts to combat consequences of environmental impact 

Ethiopian volunteers have planted over 350 million seedlings to reverse the impacts of decades of deforestation.
Swedish millionaire John Eliasch purchased 400,000 acres of the Amazon rainforest from a logging company for its preservation.
Two-fifths of European lands are now covered by trees.
Iceland is now replanting giant forests destroyed by the Vikings.
Paris goes car free for one Sunday a month to limit percentage of harmful emissions.

Amazon, an international concern 
#PrayForAmazonia, #PrayForAmazons #ActForTheAmazon are trending online around the world to denounce those who have not been doing enough to douse fire while drawing attention to protect the “Planet’s lung”.
French President Macron called for action in his tweet on 23rd August, “Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rainforest – the lungs which produces 20 percent of our planet’s oxygen – is on fire. It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 Summit, let’s discuss this emergency first order in two days! #ActForTheAmazon”
On 22nd August, António Guterres, the Secretary of UN tweeted, “I’m deeply concerned by the fires in the Amazon rainforest. In the midst of the global climate crisis, we cannot afford more damage to a major source of oxygen and biodiversity. The Amazon must be protected.”

Active efforts and actions urgently required 
Climate change initiatives will suffice ecological needs only when adequate patterns and sustainable measures are adopted. Sharper global strategy needs to be implemented to prevent such tragedy in the future. Damages done in the past and present need to be healed in order to aim for a richer sustainable future. The Convention on Biological Diversity, 29 December 1993, has three main objectives, a) conservation of biological diversity, b) sustainable use of the components of biological diversity, and c) fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources.
As embodied in the Convention, if governments and all sectors of society apply the concepts for conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity an utmost priority, we can experience a sustainable relationship between humanity and nature in generations to come. The application of these government led policies aren’t sufficient in themselves to restore the damage caused. Indigenous people who were viewed more as victims than as agents are actively participating since 2008 seeking roles to combat climate change. And their participation is crucial too, as they have centuries old methods passed down through generations which are difficult to discover through modern scientific practices.
There are ongoing efforts to “not ruin” the environment any more by people all over the world as individuals or as a group. There are centuries old experience passed down through generations and colossal amounts of research done by the scientific world. The culmination of all the knowledge around the world for the good of all is very hard to do, unless we start acting on it.
How should individuals respond? 
Here are some actions that should be everyone’s habit considering environmental vulnerability:

Reducing paper and wood consumption; reducing waste overall,
Reducing consumption of petroleum products,
Growing vegetables at home as far as possible,
Supporting campaigns, raising projects for awareness.

Nepali context

The 6th National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP), 2018 aims to provide biodiversity awareness, incentives and subsidies for farmers involved in in-situ conservation of indigenous breeds while encouraging sustainable production, consumption and sustainable resource management. Maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem and climate change planning is an ongoing priority. At this outbreak where forests are being destroyed by either human actions or by natural catastrophes, Nepal should prioritize preserving its forest areas and ecosystem. Development projects should be reassessed by conducting Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) according to Environment Protection Act (1997).
The proposed Nijgadh airport which requires cutting of around 2.4 million trees should be carefully considered. Instead, there should be considerable efforts to find unproductive or barren lands where building an airport would have less environmental impact. The place which is allocated for the Nijgadh airport already has a rich biodiversity which significantly helps against the effects of climate change. Besides, there are plenty of places in Nepal such as Mahabharata and Chure ranges among plenty others where protection or preservation of the natural resources will be paramount. On the ongoing worldwide efforts to combat climate change, Nepal can play a vital role. Not many places in Nepal are urbanized and there are still plenty of natural resources in this tourist destination of the world.
The world we live in is at the tipping point already and is changing rapidly, even more than we can imagine. It is predicted that by 2030, there will be a rise in average annual temperatures, sea levels and melting glacial levels. The aftermaths of this will adversely affect normal human life by decreasing efficiency levels, causing prolonged life altering diseases and so much more. This can only be averted if we act on it now. Nature deserves to breathe the way it’s supposed to; if we choose to act on it, so will we.

http://english.lokaantar.com/interview/think-equal-womens-health-nepal/,"Well-being is not just the absence of illness and injury.
Gender equality, with investment in gender-responsive services and infrastructure that meets the needs of women and girls, is essential for a world where all women achieve the highest possible standards of physical, mental, reproductive and sexual health throughout their lives.
As the global voice for women’s health, FIGO believes that the challenges women face – in their choices, pathologies and safety – cannot be solved in clinical isolation.
We asked Dr Kusum Thapa, President of NESOG (Nepal Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists), National Coordinator for FIGO’s PPIUD project in Nepal, and Senior Maternal Health Advisor at Jhpiego, about the barriers she sees to equal access of public services and sustainable infrastructure in Nepal, and innovations that are raising the status of women.

The theme of International Women’s Day this year is ‘Think equal, build smart, innovate for change.’ What does this mean to you in the context of women’s health?
Collective action is our shared responsibility, driving a gender-balanced world.
As women in medicine, we want to protect, promote and advance women’s health in general. To do this, we need to be able to gender balance the workspace: to design, plan and implement innovative solutions that address the emergent and intractable women’s health problems on a global scale.
Change should be based in the principles of integrated innovation, multisector collaboration, responsive design and rigorous evaluation of what is effective in the local context. Not only in maternal health, but women’s health in the broadest sense. We want to celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women in all the sectors.
Access to public services is essential for health and wellbeing, particularly primary care: but there is often a dangerous gap between men and women, rural and urban. Please could you address the biggest challenge you see for women in Nepal when it comes to accessing public services?
Gender stereotyping and discrimination are the biggest challenges I see for women in Nepal when it comes to access. It creates obstacles, not only to reproductive health services like contraceptive and abortion, but public services in general.
Stereotyping women as mothers within marriages is seen in policy and practice across Asia and the deeply patriarchal structure we live in. Marital status remains a pre-requisite for women to obtain sexual and reproductive health (SRHR) services in Nepal. Single women, unmarried women and women with different gender identities are unable to access SRHR services to the same extent.
Women are still dying of traditional harmful practices like Chaupadi (menstrual hut) and around 41 percent of women are married before the legal age, further increasing the rate of teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality.
Lack of education, infrastructure, lack of commitment and strong political will to implement on the ground further perpetuates the magnitude of the problems, despite strong polices in paper.
How is NESOG working to advance gender equity when it comes to access to public services?
NESOG is committed to advancing gender equity and access to public services. We have trained our frontline providers in gender sensitivity, and our approach to women’s health has always been women-centred. We are constantly striving to attain target 5.6 of Goal 5 on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and empower women to make informed decisions regarding health services.
Evidence demonstrates that where women’s right to health, including sexual and reproductive health, is upheld, they are more able to claim their education, work, and equality within the family and beyond. Approaching these issues in an integrated way is critical.
One of the ways we do this is through partnering with FIGO on the Postpartum IUD (PPIUD) Project. The project increases the capacity of healthcare workers to provide more comprehensive family planning options, specifically in the postpartum period.
OBGYNs are on the frontline of women’s health, and change. What is the most exciting innovation you have seen when it comes to accelerating progress for gender equality in your field?
The most gratifying and innovative work for me has been in response to gender-based violence in Nepal. Practices such as early marriage, forced marriage, non-spousal violence and other forms of exploitation still prevail, and I was lucky enough to take a lead in the healthcare response.
The Nepalese government has taken important steps to combat gender-based violence, and NESOG has been supporting a national protocol and training package on ‘Health Response to Gender Based Violence for Frontline Health Workers’ alongside Jhpiego and UNFPA. I feel fortunate to be working in an organisation which has these principles at heart. Nepal now has a Domestic Violence Act, government funding for programs on gender violence, and a hotline for survivors to register complaints.
We need to ensure that frontline health workers are equipped with the knowledge and skills to care for women suffering from gender-based violence. There is no unified training for health care workers to identify survivors, provide medical and emotional support, or carry out the necessary documentation and referrals. In many cases, medical evidence is not properly recorded, leading to low prosecution and conviction rates for rape cases.
Can you share a story that illustrates why healthcare systems must respond more directly to the specific healthcare needs of women and girls?   
It is a chilly night in rural hospital in Nepal. I have been asked to attend a young woman who is lying in a pool of blood as nurses rush around her. A mother of three small daughters, she is four months pregnant and badly beaten. After resisting her husband’s demands to terminate the pregnancy, she has paid a heavy price.
The woman had visited the health facility twice before, once with a black eye, once with bruises all over her back and arms. She said that she had fallen down the stairs.
If the provider had spent more time with her to understand the situation, she might not have been a victim of a repeat incident. The role of medical staff in identifying violence and providing non-judgemental, supportive treatment is key – but all too often this is done poorly, if at all.
Fortunately, Sita survived. But despite all our efforts, we could not save her unborn child.
Gender-based violence is a grave social and human rights concern affecting virtually all societies. Effective plans to strengthen health facilities and equip health workers to deal with gender-based violence are of utmost importance and could save lives.

KP Sharma Oli-led government has completed its nine months. The government has claimed to have made positive developments at many fronts including in foreign affairs. Bimal Gautam and Sushil Pant from Lokantar caught up with Pradeep Gyawali, Minister, Foreign Affairs, to talk about foreign policies of the government and other related issues. Excerpts:
There have been comments that Nepal has given importance only to neighbouring countries and this has narrowed country’s foreign policy.
This comment is partially true. Due to political instability in the past, foreign policy could not get a positive direction. We are serious in overcoming it. We have been able to bring wayward foreign policy into track.
I have been telling that our foreign policy consists of four aspects. The first one is neighbourhood. Neighbours naturally get first priority. Second, our development partners like European countries, the US, Japan and so on. Third, labour destination countries where 3 million youths work. Their safety and dignity is in our foremost interest. Fourth, United Nations and multilateral regional organisations.
We have paid due attention to all these four dimensions. The PM is about to visit our development partner countries after successful completion of both the neighbouring countries. He will attend programmes in international forums. For example, he will attend Word Economic Forum.
I have visited Europe two times and Japan once. At the sidelines of the UN Assembly, I have talked with important officers in the US. We have been planning to form a bilateral consultation mechanism with the US at the foreign minister level.
So, rather than limiting ourselves to neighbours we have broadened our foreign relations.
We talk about balance in foreign policy but it is seen that top leadership of our southern neighbour has visited Nepal many times while no top leader from our northern neighbor has arrived so far.
Nepalis are concerned about it. PM Oli during his visit to China has invited both the Chinese President and the Premier to visit Nepal. I want to quote President Xi Jingping here. He said, “Nepal is in the journey of stability and prosperity. This is an appropriate time to visit Nepal. I will be there on an opportune moment.” I am confident that top Chinese leadership will come to Nepal on an appropriate occasion.
Both China and India have shown interest in bringing railway line to Nepal. Is it their goodwill or a strategy to stop one another’s influence?
It involves both aspects. But goodwill triumphs all other things. You should understand that railway project is Nepal’s proposal rather than a necessity for China or India. Nepal needs railways to join the world economy and be in tune with the rapid development the world has been witnessing.
We are happy that both our neighbours are positive on this project. Both the neighbours have signed memorandum of understanding with us on the issue of Keyrong-Kathmandu, Kathmandu-Lumbini and Raxaul-Kathmandu railway lines.
Both the countries have been carrying out feasibility studies. China has completed the study while India is still in the process. As soon as the feasibility study completes, we will prepare DPR and construction work will commence.
I think six or seven years after the DPR we will be connected with two of the biggest countries and rapidly developing economies through railways. Nepal will transform herself into a land-linked country from a landlocked country.
Both our neighbours may have their own interests in the project. China naturally wants to be connected with India’s big market and vice versa. Nepal can provide a good transit point for them. But I reiterate, this railways project is basically a part of Nepal’s development plan.
Why is SAARC stalled? Who hindered Nepal to transfer chair to Pakistan?
It is an unfortunate development. SAARC is a common forum for around 1 billion 800 million people in South Asia. It should function at any cost. Nepal always supports active and impactful SAARC.
There are disputes between countries but those discords should not obstruct any regional and international cooperation. SAARC is under the shadow of two big countries. Nepal has been continuously striving to bring SAARC out of the shadow and to build an environment of trust. We are not seeking any alternatives to SAARC. Maybe this regional organization is waiting for a favourable time to bounce back. All member states have the responsibility to vitalize it and Nepal has been doing her best on this.
It has been heard that India has refused to accept the report presented by Eminent Persons’ Group. Why could not the report be submitted?
India has formally replied that the PM is busy. That may be a reason for delay in accepting the report. The definition of Nepal-India relations will change after both the governments take ownership of the report and start implementing it. Multiple changes in the legacy bestowed by history to both the countries will change. Even if the countries are mismatched in geographical and population size, both will go ahead in the spirit of cooperation as sovereign countries with equal status.
We have cleared all doubts regarding the report with India’s Foreign Minister. Some sections of the society do not want to see the ties going forward in a positive direction and they might have wrongly briefed her about the report. But I am confident that all the obstacles will be overcome. Both the premiers have initiated this process and they want to see it arriving at a logical conclusion. I reiterate – EPG report and its implementation will bring about a huge change in ties. It will be a change for good.

India-Nepal relations are defined with a lot of cliches, but where do we stand right now?
India-Nepal relations cannot be measured within the parameters of diplomacy and politics. They encompass a shared culture, economics and a common way of life.
As a developing country which is just becoming a functional democracy, what are the aspirations of Nepal?
We aspire to first establish and stabilise the federal democratic republic. Secondly, Nepal is a country of diversity in geography, religion, ethnicity and language. We have to recognise these identities and address the problems of the various groups, to unify all.
Nepal is economically one of the least developed nations and we have economic aspirations. We have resources—hydro, tourism, agriculture—but they need to be developed.
What are your expectations from India?
India is our nearest neighbour and very closely related to us. Our life and future is together, so we have to move forward together for economic development. We have to be better developmental partners. We have hydro resources, India needs power. India has large lands, we have water for irrigation. Our cooperation needs to pick up pace. We need to pick up pace. We need to discuss the technical issues or financial issues that are slowing us down.
How do you define your relationship with China?
After India, there is China.
We have very good diplomatic relations with China. However, the dynamics we have with India are not there with China. We have an open border with India, there is a visa policy with China. Relations between India and China have improved vastly since the 1960s, and that is good for Nepal. If we all work together, our entire region will thrive.
There is a perception that Nepal is leaning closer to China.
When I go to India, I hear that Nepal is getting close to China. What I hear in China is exactly the opposite. In China, they even confuse us sometimes with Indians.
Why did Nepal pull back from the BIMSTEC military exercise?
That was a very small incident, it was not a definer of relations between two close countries. We sent observers, like Thailand did. Our internal preparations to participate in the exercise were not in place. We were not against the exercise, we simply weren’t ready. This is what the prime minister told me.
What are Nepal’s expectations from China?
Nepal is landlocked, it has only two options, India and China. Between China and Nepal, right now there is only one road, the Kathmandu- Lhasa highway, which is in bad shape after the 2015 earthquake. We would like China’s help in connectivity and infrastructure development.
Mr Modi has assured us that the rail link from India will come to Kathmandu very soon. China has also proposed a 78km rail link to Kathmandu. The day we have one train arriving from India and another from China, Nepal will be a connectivity hub. But this will not be easy. I do not see it happening in our generation.
China has offered its ports to us, but the closest Chinese port is 3,000 km away, Kolkata [less than 1,000 km away] remains the best option.
China cancelled some hydro electric projects with Nepal recently.
Yes, the Chinese cancelled the Seti and Budhi-Gandaki projects [the latter has been reissued to another Chinese firm]. They could not complete the works in time, so the companies decided to withdraw. They say the Nepal government did not co operate, Nepal says they failed to complete their task.
Does Nepal feel threatened by India?
Those who are closer to each other expect more from each other. These expectations may sometimes cause confusion. India has played a very vital role in establishing democracy in Nepal.
Your party, Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum, was against the constitution initially. Now you are part of the government. Have the issues been resolved?
Not yet. The constitution and the new constituencies are not adequately representative of the Madhesis, or the indigineous communities like Limbus, Gurungs, Sherpas and Tamangs. We decided to participate in the government on the assurance that these issues will be resolved once the constitution is amended.
The government is enacting laws to implement the constitution. Then, we will begin work on the laws for amending the constitution.
India was accused of interefering in the constitution-making process two years ago.
When there is a problem in the Terai, it affects India, as it is an open border. It is natural that India will show interest then. To suggest something for the betterment is not interference, to my mind.
But Mr Oli thought so.
That was a political move to work upon a vote bank. First, to create an anti-Indian sentiment, then to cash in on that. This happens even in India and Pakistan politics.
But after elections, those who raised these slogans are partnering with India, and even India reciprocated. These are vote bank politics and India knows that.
What is the future you see for Nepal at the end of your term.
In Nepalese politics is unpredictable. So, though we hope to complete the term, you can never tell. I hope that we achieve political stability and begin the starting of economic development.
What is Nepal’s foreign policy focus?
India and China are superpowers, we cannot compare with either. Nepal is sandwiched between these two, and for its safety, as well as development, we have to maintain neutrality. It is true that in practice, the people to people ties are are stronger with India, and we are also more reliant on India, but it is our compulsion to maintain neutrality.
But Nepal’s foreign policy is not restricted to India and China. Nepal has better relations with SAARC members than even India, we have no conflict with any country. We strongly feel that SAARC should be revived as a regional body. See how successful other regional bodies like the Arab League, European Union and African Union have been. But SAARC hasn’t succeeded beyond the ritual of summits largely because India and Pakistan bring their bilateral issues into the organisation, even though SAARC is clear that such matters should be kept out of it. Pakistan suggested that China should become a member, and there was further confusion.

When the country prepares to celebrate today the fourth anniversary of the promulgation of Nepal’s constitution drafted by the Constituent Assembly in 2015, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is confident that Nepal will move ahead in the path of ‘Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepali’ despite many challenges faced by his government. 
Here are the excerpts of his interview with government media including Rastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS), Radio Nepal, Nepal Television, Gorkhapatra and The Rising Nepal. RSS Chairman Shyamal, Chief Editor Shyam Rimal, Chief Reporter Tirtha Bhattarai and Senior Reporter Prakash Silwal were present in the interview with the PM: 

Mr. prime minister, what message would you like to convey to the Nepali people as the country enters fourth year of the promulgation of a constitution which is drafted by the Constituent Assembly. 
First of all, I would like to convey my hearty greetings and best wishes to all the Nepalese at home and abroad. We have passed three years of the promulgation of constitution. We are now in course of implementation the constitution, framing laws and building structures envisaged by the constitution aiming to address the aspirations of the people for better service- delivery.
Our utmost responsibility is to provide security and self-esteem to the people in general. We are moving ahead with clear outlook for the prosperity of the people.
We have now a majority government after we attained political rights, managed the conflict and even faced the devastating earthquake of April 2015.
We have now a federal republic achieved with proper acumen and participation of the people.
Our ancestors have a glorious history of innovations, researches and studies, which tell us that our land is naturally beautiful, fertile and prosperous. We have mines, flora and fauna, water resources, herbs and what not. We can attain prosperity from these all.
Our economic and technical capability may not be able to meet the aspirations for prosperity of the people. In view of this situation, we have developed high-level relations with our neighbours, friendly countries and international organizations in keeping with our national interest, national dignity and concern if there were any misunderstandings in the past. Although we were landlocked in the past, we are now not in a position to feel inferiority complex of being landlocked and want to seek cooperation from neighbours without compromising our national interests and concerns.
How do you evaluate these three years of new constitution as an executive head of government? 
The constitution has made the Nepali people sovereign. It has given its explanation, implementation process and its system in detail. The constitution has regarded the people as the source of sovereign power and its focal point.
I have been saying that I will not stay idle satisfied with the figures of per capita income or gross national production. There would not be any situation that any citizen will be deprived of food, clothing, housing and education of the children. This is the essence of the constitution. No one would die and no one will be allowed to die of hunger. Our destination is an equitable society. Not that everyone should have equal property, but that the state should give attention that no one should die of hunger.
We have admitted about 300,000 children to schools through especial enrolment campaign this year. We will run such campaign next year as well and ensure their continuation. This is a right to education guaranteed by the constitution. Our constitution has policies and procedures for incorporating all diversities of Nepal including geographical, linguistic, cultural and communal. It will ensure national unity.
As implementation of the constitution is on process, a party in government, which had reservations on constitution, has said it will not celebrate the constitution day. What initiative would you take for wider acceptability of the constitution? 
Some problems can be solved, but some cannot be when they are made a political issue. They are raised just as an issue, and cannot be solved. When one is hungry, he eats, but if he pretends as being hungry, he will not eat. He wants to keep the issue of hunger alive. He wants to show his hunger. I do not think we should give importance to them who pretend to be hungry.
There can also be some vested interest groups, infiltrators and some secessionists. The Nepali people themselves isolate and reject them.
However, we can adjust in genuine cases. Constitution is not as rigid as the religious scriptures. It is a progressive document and we are ready to discuss on matters, which can be amended. However, people will not support those who want to lead to disintegration in the name of amendment of the constitution.
You have been frequently raising the issue of good governance and security, but the provincial governments say that they do not have police force with them. There seem some misunderstandings between the centre and the province with regard to good governance. Moreover, there have been some challenges witnessed in security sector. Have you any plans to improve this situation? 
We should understand that the province is province, they are not separate states. We have a bicameral parliament in the centre, 753 local governments and 77 district coordination committee (DCC), which means a total of 761 governments, but they are not separate and independent from the centre. They are all organs of the Government of Nepal. The DCCs are also representative organizations of the people, they have their own responsibilities. The provinces will have provincial assemblies and governments, but we do not have infrastructures for their offices. Three years ago, I had planned for it, but some people spent time in the game of pulling down my government.
However, we have done a lot in the meantime. Several laws were formulated after this government came. There are provisions for local laws, judges and taxation. How could that be done, when no one was familiar to all this. If something is lacking, it should not be like parents giving away parental property to children and quarrelling over this. We can discuss and manage for the service of the people. There are also some tendencies of making hue and cry to spread anarchy.
As for security, our society lives with high values and ideals. We have Tharu community in Nepal, which has a family with more than hundred members, sharing the same kitchen. We cannot imagine such tolerance elsewhere in the world. Attempts are being made to weaken this. The decline of moral values has been transformed into social crimes. Animals do not cheat or conspire. However, when consciousness is used differently, it amounts to crime. At present moral values and norms are violated, in which we should all be careful.
How would you move ahead to make the implementation of constitution and concept of prosperity successful? 
Constitution drafting was challenging, but we faced this successfully. The constitution has been made in a way the Nepalese people had wanted, not in a way any others wanted. The torch-bearers of democracy should have maturity. There is not a long history of Nepali people exercising their sovereign rights. The main essence of democracy is to accept the peoples’ mandate. To shun democracy in any pretext is authoritarianism. However, the tendency of shunning democracy does not have future in Nepal.
Why did we coin the slogan ‘Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepali?’ It is based on the adage of our ancestors – Sarve bhavantu sukhinaḥ Sarve santu nirāmayāḥ (May all be prosperous and happy, May all be free from illness). Happiness comes from prosperity, but not from this alone. We cannot sleep when there is terror, fear and insult. Prosperity only is not sufficient for a man to be happy.
Happiness is the knowledge of our ancestors, the conclusions drawn by our saints and sages as well the philosophy of Karl Marx that sorrow should not only be explained but be transformed into happiness, and the conclusions by Puspalal and Madan Bhandari and the totality of the democratic republicanism. Political change is already there and now good governance and development is the path towards our prosperity. A seed is sown; it will bear fruit in the end. We want to reach the destination of prosperity and happiness through good governance and development.

Nepal’s decision to pull out of the joint BIMSTEC military drill in Pune couldn’t have come at a worse time for India with the Nepali Army set to participate in a 12-day-long joint military exercise with China from September 17 in Chengdu.
Nepal has thwarted India’s strategy to form a regional alliance excluding China and Pakistan by holding a joint exercise with China snubbing the BIMSTEC joint military drill. It is considered a major diplomatic setback for India.
Sputnik talked to Geeta Kochhar, professor of Chinese Studies in JNU and visiting scholar at Fudan University, China, on India-Nepal ties.
Sputnik: How do you view China’s latest overtures in Nepal?
Geeta Kochhar: China has a long history of military ties with Nepal. In fact, during the civil war, China helped King Gyanendra with military supplies. It is not new, just that now it is more open…. Recently, China has also helped Nepal build an academy to keep surveillance on people.
Sputnik: How will Nepal-China military ties impact India?  
Geeta Kochhar: I think India should not worry too much about these ties, but concentrate more on protecting its own borders from the illegal inflow of Nepalese in Indian territory that pose challenges to the stability of India and rise in human trafficking using India also a transit route.
In fact, we should follow China’s model of making stringent checkpoints on the India-Nepal border.
China has its own imperative to protect its investments and citizens in Nepal, while Nepal wants to take advantage of China to increase its capabilities.
Sputnik: What should be India’s strategy to counter China’s increasing influence in Nepal?
Geeta Kochhar: India cannot stop Nepal’s deeper engagement with China, but can limit its influence on India-Nepal relations.
As a sovereign nation, Nepal may want to engage with China, but India needs to build its own capabilities and think what it wants from Nepal and what can be offered to Nepal in a more holistic manner. A piece-meal strategy is no future of India-Nepal relations.

http://english.lokaantar.com/interview/nepal-china-relations-extraordinary-unprecedented-pm-oli/,"Government of both neighbours–China and India–have called Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli‘s slogan of ‘prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalis’ as ‘significant’, while recognizing it at the government level. In this light, Prime Minister Oli has described Nepal’s relation with China as extraordinary and unprecedented during an interview with RSS Special Correspondent Hari Lamichhane at the fag end of his six-day China visit in Lhasa of the Tibet Autonomous Region Saturday. Excerpts: 

Right Honourable Prime Minister, You have been serving tirelessly for Nepal and Nepalis since a very long time, where do you get this energy from? 
It has now become my habit to work for many hours a day. I don’t find it difficult to work for seventeen to eighteen hours in a day.
The Government of China welcomed you with high respect, while a 14-point joint statement has already been released. Overall, how enthusiastic can we become over it? 
Naturally, China is not only our immediate friendly nation but also a very reliable and everlasting cooperative friendly neighbour. A friendly nation, with whom we have never had any problems, and one who has always been supporting us. The agreements that had been reached during my previous visit here in March 2016 and the subsequent joint press statement were historical. The agreements in the joint statement are on matters that would guide Nepal to a new era and take Nepal-China relations to newer height. Taking those agreements forward and making them timely are the needs of the day. And we discussed accordingly, and hence there is no reason for us to not be optimistic in practice.
We are hopeful. The many agreements reached between us have been reflected in the joint statement. We have moved ahead in the area of increasing investment of the government as well as the private sector, and the support from the government side. There too, one would not find any reason not to be content.
Mr Prime Minister, railways was the subject of highest public concern during this visit. How strong has the possibility of Keyrung-Kathmandu railway become with the agreement reached in Beijing? 
Definitely, this is a matter that is yet to undergo a survey. So far it is a matter based on our aspirations. Chinese President Xi Jinping did clarify his vision of reaching railway service up to Kathmandu. This railways has already reached Shigatse and would ultimately be reaching to Kathmandu, Pokhara and then to Lumbini via Keyrung. For now, Kathmandu is the minimum destination.
What people feel strange about this is that we are talking about inland waterways and operating riverboats even though the world has made drastic changes in this sector. But we are working and we will mark the beginning of this soon. People find it weird when we talked about owning ports and operating ships and they considered it a strange too while proposing alternative routes and provision for transportation. Also many others considered it something different as we talked about the country’s graduation to a modern age. This is not something to be considered strange.
I have floated the slogan of Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalis to move ahead based on the systems of political and diplomatic affairs, social order, good governance and economic development. It has a valid reason. Under this very aspect, we are not talking just to touch our border land by the railway from any other country. The east-west railway, railway linking the capital city, Kathmandu-Pokhara railway, railway inside Kathmandu Valley, Thankot-Dhulikhel railway and Kathmandu-Birgunj railway are means for ensuring better connectivity to enter Nepal into a modern age. All areas of relations, transportation and information should be used for development in a modern way. So, again questions have been raised over the railways but we have agreed on finalizing the feasibility study and proceed ahead for other related works.
Agreement was made in Beijing on Nepal’s cargo transport and the Prime Minister also met with the Chief of Government of Tibet. Looking at these two developments, agreement and meeting together, how Nepalis can take benefits now? 
The agreement has been signed. We had a lot of difficulties to supply goods from one belt of the northern area of our own country to the rest part in the country. We had difficulties in case of supply of medicines or relief and rescue materials and supply essential goods in case of epidemic. In those circumstances, we used to use Tibetan highway temporarily. Now, that situation has been put to an end. Now, we can use the Tibetan highway in such times and we can supply goods in any belt of our northern region. It has been quite favourable for us. During my talks with the Chief of Government of Tibet twice, he was found to be very positive in this regard. Their aspiration is positive. Their support will be continued with supportive aspirations in a positive way.
You have been repeatedly saying that friendship is greater than the projects. While looking through the lens of friendship, what height this visit has offered to the bilateral relations? 
This is extraordinary, this is unprecedented. The agreement and joint statement of 2016 were extraordinary. The present one has further advanced the same. This is incredible.
The nation is opening multi doors for development and prosperity under your leadership. During the visit, you and Chinese President Xi held one-on-one meeting for about half an hour. Are new perspectives developing in new era? 
Definitely, I talked to President Xi for about 35 to 40 minutes on an individual basis and then 35 to 40 minutes in a group. Then talks were held with Chinese Premier for around an hour in the dialogue venue while around an hour on an individual basis. These talks have played an important role to strengthen bilateral relations in a multifaceted way.
In this hour, I want to share that Nepal is not involved in it lightly and does not want to develop diplomacy for temporary purpose. Some people say, north and south cards are used but we do not use any cards, we want to extend the hands of friendship with both neighbours. We don’t believe in using cards, we only believe in friendship. We want to extend our friendship to extend others’ friendships with their friends as well.
Finally, you are now on a China visit, few days ago you visited India, and people are eagerly waiting for a clear message of this visit, what is the purpose of this visit? 
In practice, I made a trip to India, which was followed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Nepal. Then bilateral projects are showing good results. Similarly, achievements of this visit will be seen gradually. Developing railways is not like using a magic stick. The process has begun for it.
Various hydro projects, industrial parks, industries and cooperation sectors have extended. Works have begun and would gain speed. Results will prove it. People used to think that silence is diplomacy, some other believe in diplomacy to tolerate whatever happens. But we move ahead keeping national interest, international laws and obligations in the centre. And we keep friendly relations in the highest place so our policies and priorities are right. We are moving ahead with success of these policies, which are already reflected in practice.

http://english.lokaantar.com/interview/local-polls-strengthened-nepals-democracy-give-local-representatives-time-deliver/,"Kathmandu, 14 June (2018) – Electing local representatives after a long gap has been an important milestone for the functioning of Nepal’s democracy, a political scientist has asserted.
Speaking with Lokantar Saad Gulzar, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Stanford University, said that local polls have strengthened Nepal’s democracy and newly elected local representatives should be given time to learn about their jobs.
“People ran for the offices for the first time as local polls took place in Nepal for the first time. There may be some anomalies in local representatives’ jobs but they are still learning,” Gulzar said.
Gulzar also said that it is important to devolve certain responsibilities to the local level so that people performing at the lower level can work for the benefit of the people and also rise up the ranks.
“Giving good services within their jurisdictions and matching the expectations of their electorate will ensure the rise of local politicians,” he said.
Gulzar suggested that it would be useful for local representatives to ask the people what they want and deliver the demands.

Pratima Sherpa, a 19-year-old amateur golfer from Nepal, will make her first appearance in a professional event on the Symetra Tour later this month.
Sherpa, the subject of an Emmy-winning SC Featured installment last April, will play in the IOA Championship presented by Morongo Casino Resort & Spa on a sponsor exemption March 29-31 in Beaumont, California. She is looking to become the first female golf professional from Nepal.
“Being from Nepal and from a poor family, I had never imagined my identity could become a national golfer of Nepal and today I am in the USA because of golf,” Sherpa said in statement released by tournament organizers. “I feel so proud to say that I am the first Nepali who has been invited by the LPGA to play in a tournament with the Symetra Tour. This is a really big opportunity in my life. In fact, this is like an achievement for my country.”
The SC Featured piece showed Sherpa’s golf journey, which began while she was living with her parents in the maintenance shed at Royal Nepal Golf Club. She came to the U.S. in January to live with the Montano family in Ventura, California. She is a student at Santa Barbara City College and practices with its golf team. She previously came to live with the Montano family in the summer of 2017.
“I have always had a dream to play on the LPGA. I never imagined that dreams can become a reality in such a very short time,” Sherpa said. “I always follow two things in my life: nothing is impossible and hard work always pays off. Being invited by the LPGA and Symetra Tour has helped me to prove these things.”

The Ministry of Youth and Sports has prepared a 15-year master plan in a bid to boost up the country’s sagging sports sector. The master plan is all set for implementation from this year. 
The Ministry has come up with a new master plan realising the lack of vision, long-term goals and a well-organised system for the development of sports sector in a strategic manner as per the letter and main spirit of the slogan – Sports for Health, Sports for the Nation – determined in the 13th National Plan (2013 -2016). 
Talking to RSS, the national news agency, here today, Minister for Youth and Sports Jagat Bahadur Sunar (Bishwakarma) said the master plan has been prepared for enhanced development of the sports sector while confronting challenges like lack of physical infrastructures for organising national and international sports competitions and of the private sector participation in this sector. 
Goals have been set to complete works within five, ten and 15 years in the master plan. Thirty-three per cent women participation in sports within five years, 45 per cent within 10 years and 50 per cent within 15 years under wider and inclusive participation have been proposed in the master plan. 
Similarly, the master plan has also set a plan to construct basic physical infrastructures of sports, arrangement of sports coach in all schools of the country within five years, at least one football ground and cricket ground of international standard in all provinces within 10 years and one multi-purpose sports village in each province within 15 years. 
The ambitious goals including standing at third position in South Asian Games within five years, winning bronze medal in Olympic within 10 years, organising Asian Cricket Tournament within 10 years and organising Asian Games in Nepal within 15 years are in the master plan. 

Maintaining sports discipline by strengthening sports-related organisations, encouragement to players, coaches and sports human resources, developing international relation for the development and expansion of sports and mobilizing cooperation are incorporated in the master plan. 
The master plan has focused on encouraging people with disabilities to pursue sports by their choices and need. Local, national and international cooperation and collaboration will be sought in implementing the plan. Likewise, an economic strategy will be adopted to attract donor agencies and international aids for the plan through various means like Nepali embassies in foreign countries. 
The government has a plan to construct a well-equipped sport village in each constituency, and has incentive and social security programmes for athletes and coaches like the management of social security by categorising athletes and coaches contributing to national and international sports and ensuring their professional security.

Dhangadhi, 10 April – The first day of the much awaited Dhagadi Premier League was full of delight and joys as one of the biggest domestic tournament in Nepal commenced today in Dhangadi known as “The city of cricket”.
The first tournament being played with the auction system, Dhangadi Premier League becomes the biggest domestic tournament to be played outside TU stadium. Attracting lots of spectators on the field, DPL managed to successfully end up it’s first day of opening where CYC Attariya managed to win the first game of the tournament.
The Charm of CYC Attariya
On it’s first game, Kathmandu Goldens playing against CYC Attariya, won the toss and decided to field first. Led by team captain Gyanendra Malla, CYC openers could not give a fine start to their team.
Sandeep Sunar stumbled against Sompal Kami losing his wicket on his fifth bowl adding four runs on the scoreboard. The big names Gyanendra Malla, Mehboob Alam could not perform well along with Dilip Nath who was also a part of Emerging Cup tour to Bangladesh.
Yogendra Singh Karki being the first cricketer to score a half century of the tournament, built a much needed inning with 57 personal runs, which included seven boundaries and a six off 41 bowls. Gyanendra Kunwar added not out 34 runs on the board while it was surprising to see Pradeep Airee at late order who smashed 13 runs off 5 bowls.
With two wickets for Sompal Kami and an each in the names of Manjeet, Santosh and Rohit, Goldens stopped CYC for 146/6 in 20 overs.
Chasing the target of 147 runs, Goldens’ inning was most devastating than Nepal Earthquake with only Sompal Kami and Santosh Bhatta managing to score double digits runs on their heroic innings.
A surprise was the captain Basant Regmi coming to bat as a third number batsman who scored seven runs before returning back to the pavilion.

http://english.lokaantar.com/sports/arsenal-beats-crystal-palace-2-0/,"England, 1 Jan – Olivier Giroud’s incredible scorpion kick set Arsenal on the way to a victory over Crystal Palace which moved them up to third in the Premier League.

With a cross from Alexis Sanchez delivered behind him, Frenchman Giroud elastically reached the ball with his left foot, looping it over his head and in off the underside of the bar.
An Alex Iwobi header gave Arsenal a scrappy second before Palace briefly rallied to force saves from home goalkeeper Petr Cech.
The win moves the Gunners back to within nine points of leaders Chelsea, while Palace stay 17th, two points above the relegation zone.
The visitors have won only once in 13 league games, with manager Sam Allardyce awaiting his first victory since taking over from Alan Pardew.

http://english.lokaantar.com/sports/9004/,"England, 1 Jan – Liverpool maintained their pursuit of Premier League leaders Chelsea as they moved to within six points of the pacesetters with victory over Manchester City at Anfield.

Georginio Wijnaldum’s soaring eighth-minute header from Adam Lallana’s cross was enough to put Liverpool in second place and put a serious dent in City’s own title challenge.
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp led the celebrations at the end of a game that was high on energy but sadly lacking in any moments of genuine quality.
City, who laboured throughout, improved in the second half but never seriously threatened Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and this loss leaves them 10 points adrift of Chelsea.

http://english.lokaantar.com/sports/aston-villa-leeds-united-draw-1-1/,"England, 29 Dec – Jonathan Kodjia’s late penalty preserved Aston Villa’s unbeaten home record in the Championship as they salvaged a draw against in-form Leeds.

Pontus Jansson headed the visitors ahead from a corner after the break and the defender then hit the crossbar.
After Liam Cooper handled under pressure in the box with four minutes left, Kodjia equalised from the spot.
There was still time for Leeds winger Hadi Sacko to hit the bar and Rob Green to deny Kodjia a winner.
Leeds missed the chance to move up to third but climb a place to fourth, while Steve Bruce’s Villa are now five points off the play-off places.
Villa were the better side in the first half, with Kodjia and Jordan Ayew forcing saves from Green, but the game came to life when Garry Monk’s side took the lead.
On-loan centre-back Jansson was left unmarked and powered a header at Mark Bunn, but the Villa keeper was unable to stop it crossing the line.
Leeds, who had won eight out of 10 heading into the match, looked likely to emerge victorious until the hosts were awarded a penalty for Cooper’s handball after referee Roger East had consulted with assistant Andrew Garratt.
There were chances at both ends in a frantic finale, with Jansson having an effort from close range blocked and Kodjia shooting wide moments after being foiled by Green.
Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce: “It’s the best Leeds team I’ve seen in a good few years.
“They’re confident, playing well and you can see that in abundance. But we stuck at it and got a point out of the game.
“We might have nicked it and I think that might have been a bit unfair.
“We’re still unbeaten at home but we’ve got a lot of work to do, I’m under no illusions about that. We’re still a long way away from where we need to be.”
Leeds United boss Garry Monk: “We got the goal and had two or three really good chances that you have to take.
“Had we taken one of them I think we would have won the game quite comfortably.
“But a good team like Aston Villa, who are very experienced, stuck in there and had their chances as the game went to and fro towards the end.
“It shows how far we’ve come that we’re disappointed not to win here against a team that have a fantastic record at home.”

But Liverpool responded positively after a disjointed start, with Adam Lallana and Roberto Firmino scoring before the break as the hosts took the lead.
Jurgen Klopp’s men made sure of the win, which moves them one point ahead of third-placed Manchester City – whom they play on New Year’s Eve – when Giannelli Imbula directed Divock Origi’s cross into his own net.
Adding gloss to the scoreline was Daniel Sturridge, who scored his first league goal of the season – and Liverpool’s 100th under manager Klopp.

China, 22 October (2019) – The 2019 South China Sea Buddhism Shenzhen Roundtable was held in Shenzhen city of China, attracting Buddhist leaders and scholars from 18 countries including Nepal, and others from the South China Sea region.
The topic of mutual learning among civilizations were discussed over the meeting with a call for concerted efforts to enable exchanges among Asian civilizations and to foster closer bond among peoples in a bid to share the outcome of civilization development.
Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli also sent a message to the round table meeting stating that China and Nepal are friendly neighbors in terms of culture, economy and politics, according to the organizers.
The PM hoped the meeting could set a new path for worldwide and, in particular, South Asia Buddhist academic research and development. During the event, six consensuses were reached by Monks from 14 countries for mutual learning for shared development.
The theme of the 2019 South China Sea Buddhism Shenzhen Roundtable was “Mutual Learning for Shared Development”.
In the deliberations, the scholars indicated that the world is facing mounting instability and uncertainties, and called on Buddhist leaders to comply with the times, explore innovations, and work together in keeping Buddhism up-to-date so as to adapt to and lead the new era.
The participating monks and abbots pledged to strengthen international cooperation and innovative development of the Buddhist community, to continuously enhance the Buddhist cooperation in countries surrounding the South China Sea and beyond, to facilitate exchanges on Buddhism affairs, maintaining the existing Buddhist cultural system and to jointly create new types and new modes of Buddhist cultural communication and others.
At the event, Maitri, President of All Nepal Bhikkhu Association, pointed to the sound cooperation between Chinese Buddhist Association and its counterpart in Nepal.
He believed in the role of Buddhist doctrine in promoting world peace. This year marks the fourth consecutive year of the roundtable, with the participation of new Buddhist leaders from Nepal, Singapore, India, the Philippines, Indonesia and others. RSS

The Secretariat of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) announced to launch the Global Economic Development and Security Forum meant for promoting multilateralism and facilitating the common issues of development. The first high-level meeting of the Global Economic Development and Security Forum is scheduled to take place in China in 2020, according to the officials.
It is argued that BFA set up the “Global Economic Development and Security Forum” in response to the needs for interactions in an ever-changing international environment and provide a high-level dialogue and exchange platform focusing on new economic drivers and hot-button security issues.
At a news conference in Beijing today, Secretary General of BFA LI Baodong argued that the sub-forum was initiated as a dedicated platform to explore the topic of economic development and security..
According to LI, the world economy is confronted with lackluster growth, unbalanced development, as well as growing problems in financial security, food safety, logistics security and ecological security. “While the application of new technologies such as the Internet and big data has provided new growth opportunities, it has also brought new challenges in cyber security, digital economy, and information & privacy security. International economic cooperation needs to address such emerging issues as public security governance, cross-border investment and security,” he shared.
He was of the view that interrelationship between economic development and security becomes increasingly evident because it attracts growing attention as a major international issue.
Likewise, President of the Global Economic Development and Security Forum Tsang Waihung said that economic development and security are always correlated but added that the world economic development and security are under pressure.
He said “Countries face issues such as coping with international economic frictions, preventing financial risks, maintaining ecological security, ensuring energy and resources security, ensuring food and water security, and maintaining fiscal sustainability. The social security issues caused by the widening gap between the rich and the poor and unemployment also merit our attention.”
Non-traditional security situation is becoming more complex though countless efforts are being made, he said, adding that the issues of terrorism threats, trans-border drug trafficking, and trans-national organized crimes haven’t been uprooted.
According to Tsang, we need to strengthen our security response not only on the “pragmatic” side, such as improving the law enforcement cooperation mechanism, but also on the “facilitating” side, providing platforms for all to voice their opinions, especially to expand the mechanisms for regular dialogue and cooperation. Either in Asia or across the world, there are still very few dialogue and cooperation mechanisms in this regard.
Likewise, Executive Director of Global Economic Development and Security Forum Lei Qiang said security issue is interconnected for the economic development while pitching for a high-level dialogue forum for promoting innovative economic development.

East will meet west at a new business in Swatara Township.
Mom’s Momo & Deli will open in mid-May at a former Subway restaurant at 5550 Derry St. with sandwiches and Nepali cuisine.
Co-owner is Subash Sharma, a partner at the nearby Nirvana Kitchen in Susquehanna Township, who said he was looking for another business opportunity in the area. When he saw the Subway had closed, he said he wanted to bring deli fare back.
“We want to have the same kind of food. In addition, we want the Nepalese food, the dumplings and all,” he said.
In 2017, he opened Nirvana Kitchen, serving Indian, Nepali and Bhutanese foods. It was one of the first restaurants on the East Shore serving food from Nepal, and has since been joined by others including Everest Spice and Bhojan Ghar.
The Nepal population has grown on the East Shore in the past decade with a large concentration of families living in the Rutherford and Lawnton neighborhoods.
Sharma moved here from New York City where he worked in delis. He is also a partner at Pint’s bar on Fourth Street in Harrisburg.
He said Mom’s will be a new concept for the area. The restaurant will use Boar’s Head deli meats and cheeses for sandwiches and also serve Nepali specialties including momos, little purses of steamed dough accompanied by sauces.
In addition, Sharma said they will sell a hard-to-find specialty item but customers will have to wait. He’s keeping it under wraps until the opening.
Mom’s will be open Tuesday through Sunday. It will be closed on Mondays.

A former Stockton couple convicted in a human trafficking case faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for physically abusing, exploiting and threatening workers they hired from India and Nepal under false pretenses, authorities announced Monday.
After an 11-day trial in federal court, a jury on Thursday convicted Satish Kartan, 45, and his wife, Sharmistha Barai, 40, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Sacramento.
The married couple was found guilty of conspiracy to obtain forced labor and two counts of obtaining forced labor. Kartan also was found guilty of fraud in foreign labor contracting.
“These defendants exploited one victim after another, using them to labor in their home, failing to pay wages and depriving them of basic human rights,” U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott said in the news release.
 
From February 2014 through October 2016, Kartan and Barai hired people from overseas to do domestic work in their Stockton home.
Federal prosecutors said the Stockton couple made false claims about wages and work duties in advertisements seeking workers online and in India-based newspapers.
After the workers arrived in Stockton, Kartan and Barai forced them to work 18 hours a day while depriving the workers of sleep and food, according to the prosecutors. They said few of the workers were paid a wage.
The defendants kept the workers from leaving their jobs “by threatening them, by creating an atmosphere of fear, control, and disempowerment,” according to the news release. Several workers also were threatened that attempts to leave their jobs would be reported to police of immigration officials.
Sean Ragan, Special Agent in Charge of the Sacramento FBI Field Office, said Kartan and Barai did more than simply fail to pay victims for their work.
“They deprived (the workers) of their dignity and robbed them of their federally protected civil rights,” Ragan said in the news release.
Some of the workers who said they were victimized by the Stockton couple flew from India and Nepal to testify in the trial.
The abuse became worse when a workers pushed back or wanted to leave. The prosecutors said the couple at times hit or burned the domestic workers.
The defendants hit one worker on multiple occasions, according to prosecutors. Testimony in the trial indicated that Barai backhanded the worker across her face for talking back, and slammed her hands down on a gas stove, which resulted in first- and second-degree burns on her hands. The prosecutors said Barai also threatened to kill the worker and throw her bones in the garbage.
Kartan and Barai are scheduled to be sentenced June 6. The maximum sentence they each face also includes a potential $250,000 fine.
“Human trafficking is a disgraceful and unacceptable crime,” U.S. Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division said in the news release. “The defendants in this case took advantage of overseas workers, forcing them to work without pay, physically abusing them, and threatening negative repercussions if they tried to leave.”

Forty-nine people have been killed and 48 more hurt after mass shootings at two Christchurch mosques in the worst terror attack on New Zealand soil.
Anxious family and friends are pacing outside Christchurch Hospital, waiting for news of injured loved ones.
Wailing and crying can be heard at intervals, as people learn their friends will not be coming home.
“We just got some very bad news,” said Mahdi Zougub, as his friends hugged nearby.
“We think our friend… we think he’s gone. There’s a lot of emotion.”
Zougub, 22, said he was on his way to the Deans Ave mosque when a friend called and told him about the shooting. He wasn’t allowed inside.
“I could see dead bodies. Now we are just waiting to hear the story with our missing ones. We just want to go in and find them.”
Some of the shooting victims have been released and allowed to go home.
One, with a wound on his hand and another on his leg, said his phone and wallet were in the mosque and he had no way to call a taxi.
“I can’t believe it,” he kept saying.
“My children… I’m just relieved I didn’t take them to prayer today.”
A social worker eventually helped the man get a cab – although there are long lines as many of the taxi drivers are from the affected community.
Armed police remain stationed outside the hospital.
Canterbury District Health Board chief executive David Meates said it had been a tragic day.
“What we have been dealing with today is 48 gunshot wounds that were presented at Christchurch Hospital. So we have had 12 operating theatres that have been operating since this afternoon and will be continuing through until about midnight.”
Patients’ gunshot injuries ranged from “really critically injured” through to lesser wounds.
“With the size and scale of the operations we are doing today, many of those will end up having multiple operations over the coming days and weeks due to the nature of the wounds they have got.”
Meates said a “mass casualty plan” had been activated: “It is something that we plan for and hope we never have to activate, and we have had to activate that today,” he said.
“That involves us pulling in surgeons, nurses, doctors, support staff to enable us to respond, and we start deferring non-critical surgeries.”
Meates said there had been over 200 family members on site at the hospital today.
“We have been working really closely with the Muslim community, police and other agencies to make sure we have the appropriate support structures in place.”
The hospital would accommodate families who needed to stay there overnight.
Man, 28, charged with murder, due in court on Saturday
Police Commissioner Mike Bush said the shootings were “abhorrent”. At the Deans Ave mosque 41 people were killed, while seven had died at the Linwood mosque. A 49th person had died in hospital.
One man, 28, had been charged with murder and was due to appear in Christchurch District Court tomorrow morning.
“Two others remain in custody,” Bush said.
“Another person was arrested earlier today however that was not related to these events.”
Speaking about the victims Bush said: “Our love and thoughts go out to them and all of their family, all of their friends and all of their loved ones.
“We have staff around the country making sure everyone is safe, including armed offenders at all mosques. Police staff have gone above and beyond to protect people today.”
Bush said police recovered a lot of firearms from both the Linwood Avenue and Deans Ave shooting scenes.
None of the four people initially arrested had been on any terrorism watch, including in Australia, the Police Commissioner said.
Bush said he has “no intelligence” on a potential attack on St Patrick’s Day threat that has been reported. He was not aware of today’s attacks being linked to any other terrorist plots.
Police were not “actively” looking for any of the potential attackers now.
Christchurch police had a force of 1000 staff, and Bush said he would expect “everyone of them” would want to be out on the streets now. Additional officers were being flown to Christchurch from Dunedin and surrounding areas.
PM: ‘Unprecedented’ terrorist attack
Earlier tonight, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had said the death toll was 40. She said a further 20 people were seriously injured, while Christchurch Hospital has just confirmed 48 people suffered gunshot wounds.
Ardern said it was an “unprecedented” situation and described it as a terrorist attack.
“It is clear that this can only be described as a terrorist attack. From what we know, it does appear to have been well planned. Two explosive devices attached to suspects’ vehicles have been found and they have been disarmed.”
Those in custody had not been on any terrorism watch list: “It’s not a matter of someone having slipped under the radar,” Ardern said.
“There are currently four individuals who have been apprehended but three are connected to this attack and are currently in custody, one of which has publicly stated that they were Australian-born.
“These are people who I would describe as having extremist views that have absolutely no place in New Zealand and in fact have no place in the world.
“While we do not have any reason to believe at this stage that there are other suspects, we are not assuming that at this stage.
Ardern said it was obvious the attacks had been planned for some time. Three people were arrested in relation to the attacks, while one other was arrested separately.
Ardern said she could not give any more detail about the alleged offenders.
An Australian-born suspect had been in New Zealand “a relatively short time”.
She said she was asking questions about them, including access to firearms, of her officials.
The National Security Threat Level had been lifted from low to high.
The Defence Force was transporting more police to Christchurch.
Ardern said New Zealand was a place of safety where they raise their families.
“Those values will not and cannot be shaken,” she said.
“This is a place where people should feel secure.”
David Meates, chief executive of Canterbury District Health Board, said Christchurch Hospital and other health clinics were treating 48 patients for gunshot wounds.
The people shot range from young children to adults and injuries ranged from critical to minor.
Twelve operating theatres were currently in use and many people would need multiple surgeries.
There was sufficient capacity and staff at Christchurch Hospital, Meates said.
Four arrested after massacres at mosques
Gunmen opened fire at mosques in Christchurch earlier today. Four people are in custody – three men and one woman.
Police Commissioner Bush said “there have been some absolute acts of bravery” in the arrests of the four attackers.
A number of IEDs that were attached to vehicles in Christchurch have been defused by the Defence Force.
Bush said there were multiple casualties – a “significant” amount.
“This is absolutely tragic. So many people are affected.”
“We don’t have the identities of those who have died yet because those places are in lockdown.”
He said he would not assume there aren’t other attackers.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed one of the gunmen was an Australian citizen living in New Zealand.
Morrison said he was “shocked, appalled and outraged,” at the attack.
“We stand here and condemn absolutely the attack that occurred today by an extremist, right wing, violent terrorist.
“[He] has taken the lives,” he said, before correcting to: “they have stolen the lives in a vicious, murderous attack that has claimed so many New Zealanders.
Morrison said the attack reminds us about the evil that is ever present and would seek to “strike us out at any time.”
The lock down of schools throughout Christchurch was lifted at 5.50pm.
When asked if it was true that a person had been arrested wearing wired explosives, Bush said that person had been made safe.
“We’re still working through that but we believe there was a claim but that person has been made safe.”
Bush said he was aware that footage of the Al Noor Mosque shooting was on social media and police were doing everything they could to get it removed.
“It shouldn’t be in the public domain.”
Facebook Australia-New Zealand policy director Mia Garlick said the videos have been taken down.
“New Zealand Police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the livestream commenced and we quickly removed both the shooter’s Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video.”
He said police did not have conclusive information about the motivation behind the shootings.
He would not call it a terrorist attack but said it did not get any more serious in this country.
“We are currently dealing with an unprecedented situation in New Zealand. It’s very grave, it’s very serious.”
One of NZ’s darkest days
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called it “one of New Zealand’s darkest days”.
A body has been seen lying near Al Noor Mosque in central Christchurch and a second gunman has been seen near Linwood Masjid mosque.
One of the gunmen broadcast live as he shot victims.
One of the gunmen is believed to be an Australian who has written a manifesto declaring his intentions. In it, he says “it is a terrorist attack.”
The Herald has chosen not to report its contents.
Ardern described the event as “extreme and unprecedented violence”.
She will be flying to Wellington where she will speak with agents as soon as she lands.
“I’m not currently in a position to confirm the number of deaths or injuries,” Ardern said.
“This is and will be one of New Zealand’s darkest days.”
Ardern looked to be struggling to keep her emotions in check as she spoke.
Bush said Police are pouring resources into the Christchurch area.
He said they were also setting up a facility so that people could get phone in and get more information about their loved ones as a priority.
Bush said Defence Force aircrafts in Wellington were ready to fly more resources into the area.
“I want to assure the public we are doing everything we can to make sure there is no more harm to their communities.”
There was no indication there were other shooters at large.
The multiple fatalities were at two locations – a mosque at Deans Ave and one at Linwood Ave.
St John said there have been multiple fatalities.
People suffered injuries ranging from minor through to critical gun shot wounds.
A number of helicopter and road ambulances are on standby to provide support, including transporting patients to other ICUs around the country.
St John has deployed resources from throughout the country to provide cover for the next few days.
A Christchurch Star reporter saw a dead body lying close at Palazzo Lane near Al Noor Mosque.
The body has been covered with clothing.
A witness has seen a child lying in the middle of Deans Ave and another man has told the Herald his relative was shot inside the mosque.
It is understood the shooting at the mosque lasted six minutes and that the shooter may have returned to his car to retrieve more ammunition before opening fire again.
A large cordon has blocked off Strickland St around 3km from the Hagley mosque shooting.
A local man said a white van is at the centre of police focus. They believe a bomb is suspected to be inside.
The police bomb disposal unit is at the scene.
A Christchurch woman has reported watching a man being arrested on Harrow Street.
Images captured of the scene show a man being apprehended by a police officer. Two police cars are stationed nearby, blocking off the street.
‘I saw people drop dead in front of me.’
A man, who would only be known as Nour, who crawled to safety amid the carnage of the shooting has told Christchurch Star of what happened.
Nour in the front row of prayers when the gunman came in.
“First he shot people outside. Then he came in the front,” he said.
He heard the gun being reloaded about three times.
The gunman began shooting in all directions.
“I saw people drop dead in front of me. I was crawling to get away.”
“It was hitting the walls,” he said.
Nour crawled across the floor of the mosque to a window that had been broken by others as they fled and jumped trough it.
He jumped over a neighbouring wall. He ran around the block and he could still hear shooting.
Mohan Ibrahim described to the Herald running for his life to escape the gunman. He was one of 200 people in Christchurch’s Masjid Al Noor mosque when he heard shots being fired.
“At first we thought it was an electric shock but then all these people started running.”
He said there had been lots of people killed and many injured.
“I still have friends inside.
“I have been calling my friends but there are many I haven’t heard from. I am scared for my friends lives.”
He said there had been lots of people killed and many injured.
A man who took in people who escaped from the mosque has shared their description of the gunman.
He was white, aged in his 30s or 40s and wearing a uniform, but he had not been able to ascertain what the uniform was, Oakford Close resident Robert Weatherhead said.
“[They said] ‘he had a lot of magazines strapped to his legs’,” Weatherhead said.
A man who was in Al Noor Mosque during a shooting says it was absolutely full for noon prayers. He believed many have been killed.
A woman told the Christchurch Star she lay in her car near the mosque as four to five men came running towards her.
She was unsure if they were gunmen. Moments earlier she heard what she thought was gunfire.
“When the noise got louder I saw four or five men running. I put my seat down and lay down so they wouldn’t see me.
“I didn’t think I’d live to see this happening in my country,” she said.
A young man, who lives near Al Noor Mosque, said he was sleeping when he woke to 20-40 gun shots and a man running into his house with a bullet wound 3 inches into his leg.
The man with his three flatmates, who live on Brockworth Pl, called an ambulance and applied pressure on the victim’s leg.
The victim said he had just been at the mosque, multiple shots were fired and fled the scene immediately looking for assistant .
He said the victim didn’t see the armed gunman, but heard bullets ringing around.
He said that the victim told him he was almost shot in the stomach.
“I didn’t realise something of this magnitude could happen in New Zealand,” he said.
The ambulance never arrived so one of the flatmates drove the victim to hospital.
Second shooting at mosque in Linwood
A second shooting happened at a mosque in the Linwood area of the city.
One Friday prayer goer returned fire with a rifle or shotgun.
Witnesses said they heard multiple gunshots around 1.45pm.
A well known Muslim local chased the shooters and fired two shots at them as they sped off.
He was heard telling police officers he was firing in “self defence”.
“They were in a silver Subaru,” he told police.
Mark Nichols, manager of Premium Tyres and Auto in Linwood, said he a gunman ran past his shop around 45 minutes ago.
He heard five gunshots, and he believed the activity was centred around the nearby Linwood Masjid mosque.
He saw two injured people carried on stretchers past his shop. Both appeared to be alive.
“I seen a guy with a gun running up the road. He’s been firing about five shots, I think we heard,” Nichols said.
“It might have been a shotgun. I didn’t get a good luck at it, I just cleared off.
“Apparently there have been people in the mosque shot, and a police officer’s been shot too.
“It’s not very good, we’re in shutdown mode now. It’s all cordoned off.”
Christchurch resident Mandy Rooney was trapped in her car within metres of a mosque in Bishopdale.
She said she tried to get out of the car to see what was going on but was ordered back into her vehicle by armed police.
“They have their guns up and are walking around scoping through them,” she said.
“It is chaos. People have been trying to drive away and are just crashing into other vehicles.”
A witness told the Herald he had seen a body in a carpark at Papanui High School.
Papanui High School, which is north of where both incidents occurred, is in lockdown.
The receptionist said staff were hiding under their desks, and she could not comment on any activity nearby.
A man wearing military clothing has been arrested outside Papanui High School.
There is a large police presence at the hospital with many armed officers.
The New Zealand National Front has said it the events in Christchurch do not involve the organisation, nor its members.
“The National Front does not condone or agree with this type of wanton murder of innocent people regardless of their religious beliefs.
“We believe in freedom of speech and freedom to worship whatever god you chose.”
The University of Canterbury is in lock down. They say people are to stay inside until police give clearance.
Two Christchurch shopping malls are also in lockdown.
Shoppers and retail assistants at Westfield Riccarton and Northlands Mall are being told no one is allowed to leave.
The city centre is like a ghost town as police hunt the shooters.
Heavily armed police, including special units, are speeding around the empty streets with lights and sirens wailing.
Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel said her message to people is to stay away from the central city.
“If you are in the city please stay in the building you are in,” she said.
“All Council buildings are in lock down and they’re urging all central city building owners to do the same, until advised by the Police they can leave.”
‘I heard at least 20 [gunshots]’
Benjamin Jellie said he ran outside when he heard gunshots.
“I saw people jumping over the back fence of the mosque into Oakward Close. I heard at least 20 [gunshots].”
“I heard about eight at the start and then it went quiet for about 30 seconds or a minute and then it started again. I heard about eight more and then there was another minute and another eight,” Jellie said.
“Those coming over the fence, all adults and including at least three men, were screaming and crying.”
He believed the injured were all conscious.
The injured were very quiet, Jellie said.
The Bangladesh cricket team was at the mosque for Friday prayer when the shooting started.
A taxi driver in Deans Ave told Newstalk ZB that a jogger in the park said shots had been fired inside the mosque.
“Police and ambulance are coming from every direction”.
The public should not attend Christchurch Hospital unless it’s an emergency, a Canterbury DHB spokeswoman said.
“All appointments have been cancelled this afternoon, and no staff or patients are to enter or leave the building.”
Air New Zealand is offering flexibility to customers booked to fly to or from Christchurch today, in the wake of the shooting.
The airline will waive any fare change fees, should people need to make alternative travel arrangements.
Air New Zealand is also offering its support to Emergency Services managing the incident in Christchurch.

About 100,000 people from Honduras and Nepal have been granted the right to retain temporary protected status and remain in the United States for the time being under an agreement filed in federal court in San Francisco Tuesday.
The administration of President Donald Trump is seeking to end the temporary protected status for people from those countries and four others – El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti and Sudan.
The status is granted to people whose countries are undergoing upheavals from natural disasters or civil war. The Trump administration has said conditions in those countries are improving.
 
In October, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction allowing more than 300,000 people from the four other countries to remain in the United States while they challenge the termination. The U.S. Justice Department is now appealing that ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Representatives of Honduran and Nepali residents filed a similar lawsuit against the U.S. government in February. In an agreement signed by Chen on Tuesday, lawyers for both sides agreed to stay proceedings in the new lawsuit and allow the residents to remain in the United States until the appeal in the first case is resolved.
The groups represented in the second case include about 86,000 Hondurans and 15,000 Nepalis, according to the lawsuit.
Keshav Bhattarai, a lawsuit plaintiff from Nepal who lives in Sunnyvale, said the agreement “gives us all some breathing room to call on Congress to give us what we really need: permanent protection for TPS holders.”
Chen said in his preliminary injunction order that the plaintiffs in the first lawsuit had raised serious questions about whether the decision to terminate the protection was motivated by unconstitutional bias against non-white, non-European immigrants.

The Trump administration has agreed to temporarily halt the termination of humanitarian protections for more than 100,000 people from Honduras and Nepal, the American Civil Liberties Union announced Tuesday.
The decision comes exactly one month after the ACLU and other immigrant rights advocates filed a class-action lawsuit against the administration over its decision to end temporary protected status for immigrants from those two countries. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that the decision by the Department of Homeland Security to end TPS was “motivated by racial animus.”
Protections were due to end in June for 15,000 people from Nepal and next January for 86,000 people from Honduras, leaving them vulnerable to deportation.
The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on behalf of six immigrants with TPS and two U.S. citizens who are children of beneficiaries. TPS is a form of humanitarian relief granted to residents of countries devastated by natural disasters or war that allows beneficiaries to work legally while they remain in the U.S.
The program, created in 1990, applies to people from 10 countries. But the Trump administration has announced the termination of TPS for 98% of those who have it.
In October, a U.S. district judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked the administration from rescinding TPS for more than 300,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan while their case plays out in court. The administration is appealing that ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Trump administration canceled TPS for Honduras and Nepal after the first lawsuit was filed last year. Tuesday’s agreement essentially groups the fate of the two cases.
The case of Ramos vs. Nielsen alleges that government officials illegally diverged from how all previous administrations had interpreted TPS law, as part of a broad effort to decrease the number of nonwhite immigrants in the U.S. Lawyers representing the plaintiffs in Bhattarai vs. Nielsen, the case filed last month, made the same legal arguments.
Internal documents capture Trump administration debate about ending temporary immigrant protections »
Government lawyers said that those countries had sufficiently recovered from the original disasters, and that TPS was never meant to be permanent. A Department of Justice spokesman last month said the decision to terminate TPS for Honduras and Nepal was “both lawful and reasonable.”
Under the agreement, TPS will remain in place for Honduran and Nepalese immigrants at least until the appeal in the Ramos case is decided. Lawyer Ahilan Arulanantham with the ACLU of Southern California said that oral arguments with the 9th Circuit probably will be set for this summer, giving TPS beneficiaries several months of reprieve.
“I feel like I’ve been sick and this agreement is a few drops of medicine,” lead plaintiff Keshav Bhattarai, a TPS holder from Nepal who lives in Sunnyvale, near San Jose, said in a statement.
Also Tuesday, House Democrats unveiled a new version of the Dream Act, formally called the Dream and Promise Act, including a path to citizenship for beneficiaries of TPS. Arulanantham said immigrants with TPS, many of whom have lived in the U.S. for decades, deserve stability.
“Our lawsuit is not the solution to this — it’s temporary relief,” he said.

The small Nepalese community at UNK invited the Kearney community to learn more about their country.
The “Nepalese Student Association at Kearney” hosted its annual Nepali Night, offering traditional music, dance, and food.
Organizers say the nearly 20 Nepalese students would right now be celebrating the country’s Festival of Lights back home, so they say they’re celebrating together by creating a glimpse of that festival for Kearney.
“So just to share our culture like we’re not just Mount Everest or Sherpas or Gherkas,” said Nepalese Student Association at Kearney’s President Anup Khehet. “It really feels great since we’re a small community like doing this great event, it’s really important all of us members from our organization really work hard for it.”
Organizers say this will continue to be an annual event.

The bodies of two Icelandic mountaineers who died on an expedition in Nepal in 1988 have been discovered, mbl.is reports. Kristinn Rúnarsson and Þorsteinn Guðjónsson died on an expedition up Mount Pumori, 7,161m (23, 494ft), in October of 1988. The two climbers were 27 years old.
An American mountaineer came across the two bodies recently, discovering their nationality when he searched for their ID. “This is good and difficult news,” stated Anna Lára Friðriksdóttir, a friend of the deceased. She says the families of the two men held a memorial for them on November 26, 1988. “It would have been good for the parents to get to bury their children. It’s like when you lose someone at sea, there was just a memorial then[…]now it’s possible to close the case and that’s very good for their relatives.”
The expedition
Kristinn and Þorsteinn set off from London on September 17, 1988 to climb Mount Pumori. They were accompanied by Icelander Jón Geirsson and Stephen Aistrope, from Scotland. On October 2-3, the group set up base camp on Pumori around an elevation of 5,000m. On October 15, Jón left the expedition due to lung abscess. On October 17, Kristinn and Þorsteinn began their ascent from the base camp. Steve, who had come down with stomach flu, stayed behind. On October 18, Steve saw Kristinn and Þorsteinn through binoculars around an elevation of 6,600-6,700m before they disappeared from sight.
“They were good guys and great companions,” Jón said of the deceased in a recent interview. “They were ‘original’ and wanted to wear traditional Icelandic sweaters rather than the modern gear that most other people climbed in.” While reports of the young men’s disappearance in 1988 assumed they had died on their way up the mountain, Jón says it’s possible the two had reached the peak and were in fact on their way down. A climber from an Australian expedition reported seeing the two very close to the peak.
Ari Gunnarsson is the only Icelander known to have reached the peak of Pumori. He died on his descent in 1991 and his body has never been found.

Nepal will count LGBT+ people for the first time in its next census, a move that campaigners on Monday said could help sexual minorities gain better access to education and health schemes.
The census – scheduled for June 2021 – will help end stigma and challenges that LGBT+ people face in accessing support and welfare schemes, said Dhundi Raj Lamichhane, an official at the Central Bureau of Statistics.
He said people would need to identify themselves and their family members as either “male”, “female” or “others (sexual/gender community)”.
There will be no follow-up options to choose which sexual orientation they identify with in the census – a trial of which will be held in March.
The move will allow planning for social security and other rights, including government quotas, guaranteed to LGBT+ people in the constitution – which was passed in 2015 – Lamichhane told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
But gay rights activists voiced concern over the Nepalese government’s plan to combine sexual orientation with gender identity in the survey.
They cited the last census in 2011 when authorities added a “third gender” category for the first time and to count all LGBT+ people under it.
But the number of people willing to identify themselves as third gender to a census enumerator – or have their family members do so – was too small to be included in the final population count, said Kyle Knight of the Human Rights Watch.
“The government would do well to remember that ‘third gender’ can encompass a range of behaviour and identities, and also leave out many people who do not identify with the term.”
The socially conservative Himalayan nation has become increasingly progressive regarding LGBT+ rights since a decade-long Maoist civil war ended in 2006, and a feudal monarchy was abolished two years later.

In 2007, the Supreme Court ordered the government to end discrimination against LGBT+ people and put in place measures to guarantee their equal rights as citizens.
Along with Nepal, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh legally recognise transgender people, which often include intersex people and eunuchs, as a third gender.
Nepal and India have conducted national surveys with the third gender option.
But despite legislative changes, homosexuality remains taboo in Nepal, where an estimated 900,000 LGBT+ people still face harassment and discrimination, campaigners say.
Sarita K.C., an LGBT+ rights activist who was part of government consultations on the census, said authorities were lumping together sexual orientation and gender identity due to a lack of space on the form and because they wanted “rough data”.
“There are plans for a more specific, detailed survey exclusively for LGBTI (people) … hopefully by 2022. It will give more accurate data,” said Sarita, head of LGBT+ charity Mitini Nepal.
In the 2021 survey, she explained, if someone is LGBT+, they would have to tick the “others” option irrespective of whether they identified as “male” or “female”.

The exercise will allow LGBT+ people “to benefit from social security schemes and quotas set for minority groups” including in civil services, army and police, she said.
She said while she worried that the results may not reflect the real number of LGBT+ Nepalis due to confusion, identification problems or stigma, she and other activists were planning to raise awareness in the run up to the census.
“We are hoping for the best.”

Kathmandu, 3 February (2020) – In a series of debates designed to stimulate thinking and get the ideas and knowledge flowing, the French Embassy, the Alliance Française and the Beed Management came together again for a new edition of “Night of Ideas” panel discussion focusing on #BeingAlive on January 30th, 2020.
Panellists for this year’s edition included:
Alok Tuladhar, a documentary filmmaker with special interest in the documentation of Nepal’s heritage, both natural and man-made. He is also an activist who upholds the preservation of Nepalese cultural legacy for its great value in building a prosperous future. He previously worked in the field of computer software for more than two decades.
Bindu Bhandari, a climate change campaigner and policy analyst who has been involved in advocating, training and mobilizing young people in climate action over the last seven years. Currently, she works at a not-for-profit think tank called Climate Interactive and is responsible for the global diffusion of interactive climate tools developed by the organization. Prior to that, she worked with other international and intergovernmental organizations like ICIMOD and CliMates.
Jagannath Lamichhane, an activist and columnist turned life coach and vlogger, he is the initiator of Juggernaut Mindset which aims to get people thinking about the lives they lead. He talks about mental wellbeing, physical and mental health, relationship, self-support, motivation, entrepreneurship, happiness and more.
Swosti R Kayastha, a lecturer at Lumbini Buddhist University, Nepal and a scholar of Nepali Cultural Heritage. She enjoys teaching Museum studies and is a dedicated professional in the field of art, culture, exhibition curation and museum education. She also follows her passion to write articles on topics of Nepali art and culture.
In his opening remarks, H. E. Ambassador Francois-Xavier Léger said how “In this global world of challenges & opportunities, ideas & projects are emerging across various themes; and being able to celebrate this string of ideas is what #BeingAlive is all about.”
Some of the key points raised by the panellists:
Alok Tuladhar was of the view that “if you look at our history, sustainably was a key part of our civilization. Now, even the western world is looking into it. Thus, we need to realize our roots and believe in our indigenous technologies”.
Bindu Bhandari focused on “adding value to the society while making choices and that we should not forget our past when moving forward with them”.
Jagannath Lamichhane, focusing on mental health, viewed that although the social media platforms help us interact directly with the audience, it is also a threat to the psychological & physical well-being of the individuals. He considers personal, professional and social problems to be the traits of weak mental health and “while our society believes that mental health problems are incurable, being honest to oneself & the society about one’s suffering is what #BeingAlive actually means”.
Swosti R Kayastha strongly believed in preserving the cultural, traditional, heritage and ethical values while the changes occur in our lives and in society. She questioned, “how much of our culture do we really know?” and advised all “to appreciate one own’s culture and delve a bit deeper to truly identify ourselves and hence the need to #BeingAlive at such transitions”.
For Leena Dahal, the youth should be taking meaningful and tangible initiatives to make an in impact in one’s community.
About the Night of Ideas: The goal of the Night of ideas (‘La Nuit des idées’) is to celebrate the stream of ideas between countries, cultures, topics and generations. Every year, the Night of ideas gives the opportunity to discover the latest discoveries in knowledge and arts, to listen to the ones who contribute to bring more ideas to their field, and to take part in the discussion about the main issues of our times.
About Alliance Française/Katmandou:

Susmik Lama moved to South Philadelphia from Nepal in 2007. She was the only Nepali student at Furness High School and, later, in college. But she quickly felt at home, even as her family struggled to pay for housing, college tuition, and unexpected medical bills.




It was an American Dream realized gradually. And looking back, she says it shaped her politically.


Now Lama, 28, has moved to New Hampshire to work as a field organizer for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign. Part of her job is to reach out to immigrant and refugee communities in the state, which has a particularly high number of Bhutanese refugees from Nepal. Her parents also relocated to the state after her dad got a job opportunity here, and the couple volunteer for Sanders.




“I have friends who’ve come here for education. … I know someone who is a domestic worker and I know how people have struggled with visa situations here,” Lama said last week. “For him to have such an inclusive plan that incorporates every single person, for me in that plan I see faces, not just policies.”
There doesn’t appear to be public polling on immigrants and refugees specifically, but Sanders seems to have strong support among them in New Hampshire and elsewhere. A slate of leaders in the Bhutanese, Rohingya, and Congolese communities endorsed Sanders in August, and there are several nationwide “Bhutanese for Bernie Sanders” and “Nepal for Sanders” Facebook groups. No similar groups exist for other Democratic candidates.
Sanders was an outspoken critic of how the United States handled the Syrian refugee crisis and has staked out arguably one of the most liberal approaches to immigration. He often talks about how his father emigrated from central Europe, broke, and sold paint to support his family.


Lama, who is based in the campaign’s Manchester office, thinks Sanders’ policies on refugee and immigrant inclusion have attracted the eye of communities that hadn’t otherwise been engaged politically. President Donald Trump’s election activated her interest in politics — as did working in medicine as a biochemist and seeing problems with access to the health-care system.




Lama’s parents also became more engaged since she joined the campaign. Her father has voted Democratic since becoming a U.S. citizen but never volunteered with a candidate until Sanders. Her mom’s momo (a type of dumplings) have become a favorite campaign office snack.


“He tries to lift up the poor people, and that’s very important to me,” Kalyan Lama, Lama’s father, said of Sanders. “Looking out for poor people, for health insurance, minimum wage — this is my second language. I don’t know how to say all of it, but whenever he’s talking, I feel it so strong in my heart.”




More than 200,000 Nepalese live in the United States, with the largest populations in Texas, followed by New York and California. There are an estimated 96,000 Bhutanese in the United States, many of whom immigrated to this country from U.N. refugee camps in Nepal after Bhutan expelled more than 100,000 people in the early 1990s. Some settled in New Hampshire, along with larger populations in Ohio and Pennsylvania, near Harrisburg.




Nepal and Bhutan have different politics and cultures, but both border India and share the same language, and certain festivals and traditions. The United States received 7,100 refugees from Bhutan in 2018 and about 8,500 from Nepal. Bhutan was the fourth most common country of origin for immigrants in Pennsylvania from 2002 to 2015, before being surpassed by Syria in 2016 and Congo in 2017.




Suraj Budathoki is a Bhutanese refugee who also works for Sanders’ campaign in Manchester. He became a refugee at age 9, a victim of ethnic cleansing in Bhutan, and lived for 19 years in refugee camps with his family in Nepal. When he moved to the United States, he had a notion of what to expect: “The land of abundance, land of opportunity,” he said. “No poverty, no homelessness, no discrimination.”



His first job stocking grocery shelves paid $7 an hour. He immediately had to find a second job. “The reality I found was very different,” Budathoki said.




Eventually Budathoki enrolled in English classes and earned a degree from Southern New Hampshire University. He founded an organization for Bhutanese refugees, which has expanded to serve all immigrant and refugee populations.


The barriers to political engagement are huge for many refugees and immigrants, Budathoki said, from language to lack of knowledge — and even disbelief that elections could be open to all citizens. Many Bhutanese refugees living in the United States, Budathoki said, spent their lives under a monarchy or in a refugee camp, uninvolved in any democratic process.




Lama’s support for Sanders has as much to do with his policies regarding refugees and immigrants as his Medicare for All plan. Lama spent two years taking classes at Drexel University at Hahnemann University Hospital. As part of that postbaccalaureate program, she also worked with low-income patients at clinics around Philadelphia, encountering many people with no health insurance or inadequate coverage. At the same time, she was dealing with her own medical issues — anemia and a jaw disorder that caused migraines. Therapies came with pricey co-pays and insurance didn’t cover all of her medications.
Last summer, she saw Hahnemann closed and watched her new boss, Sanders, head down to Philadelphia to protest.

“That was a Philadelphia story, and I’m pretty sure people here in [New Hampshire] and all over can relate to that story — people putting profit before people and a hospital shutting down,” she said.
In Manchester last week, Lama trained volunteers on how to make calls in the critical days leading up to the New Hampshire primary. Sanders is leading by about four percentage points in New Hampshire, according to the latest Real Clear Politics polling average.
Lama led the office in a virtual video conference call with the other field offices. It started with a quote from Sanders: “Are you willing to fight for that person who you don’t even know as much as you’re willing to fight for yourself?” She asked people on the call to share whom they are fighting for.
For Lama, it’s some of the people she met working in clinics in Philadelphia. She hopes to return to the city for medical school and to become a cardiologist. Her family still owns their home near the Italian Market, close to the pho restaurant and taco stand she often craves. And she’s still a registered Pennsylvania voter who will be casting her vote in the state.
“Philadelphia is my home,” Lama said. “I was born in Kathmandu and raised in Kathmandu and I was that Kathmandu girl. When I moved to Philly, Philly was my home away from home. Philly has become my Kathmandu.”

Recently, the US Ambassador to Nepal Randy Berry visited Janakpurdham, the interim capital of Province-2. During his visit, he enjoyed the taste of famous beverage in Janakpur named Lassi, along with Paan (betel) and even enjoyed the rickshaw ride. The Ambassador enthusiastically expressed his admiration for Lassi in his tweet, “I finally got a chance to enjoy famous Janakpuria Lassi & Paan. Trust me, they were one of the best I ever had!  And the Local Rickshaw ride was unforgettable experience, too!”.
It can be inferred that the tweet of Ambassador Randy vested huge respect towards Janakpuria Lassi and its taste. His appreciation of Lassi’s taste explicitly conveys that the taste of Lassi transcends boundaries. Indeed, the tweet will surely support the “Visit Nepal 2020” campaign, attracting tourists to Janakpur.
Janakpuriya Lassi has gained immense popularity in Kathmandu as well. Many vendors have started selling Lassi with the brand name of “Janakpuriya Lassi” though it differs from the original taste of Janakpuriya Lassi.
Lassi, probably one of the most loved beverages during the summer, is made of yogurt. Lassi is the ultimate summer refresher and is the amalgamation of yogurt, water and spices or sweeteners as well as dry fruits. There are varieties of flavor in Lassi like Sweet Lassi, Salty Lassi, Mango Lassi, Bhang Lassi (mostly made during Holi Festival) and so on. Lassi makes the consumer feel cool in summer heat but it is enjoyed all around the year.
Also from the perspective of health benefits, Lassi aids digestion as the yogurt contains lactobacillus bacteria that lubricates the intestine, breaks down the food, absorbs the nutrients and helps in smooth digestion. Lassi contains healthy bacteria that help keep away the bad bacteria and prevents stomach bloats. It helps make bone stronger and consuming it daily assures good dental health as Lassi is rich in calcium. Lassi also contains Vitamin D and lactic acid which helps boost immunity and maintain youthful skin.
Lassi business can be started with a small capital of around 200,000 rupees with low risk and high-profit potential.  In the Terai Belt, the summers are lengthy, spanning about nine months so we can expect good sales of Lassi every year. A single Lassimaker sells thousands of glasses of Lassi a single day during high summer in Janakpur. Indeed, there is a probability of widening the favorable environment for Lassi business. One of the Lassi vendors told the scribe that the demand of Lassi rises during the festivals like Dashain, Chhaath and other main festivals of Janakpur and revenue is double than in normal days. To ensure brisk sales all year round there is a need to promote Lassi which is the most preferable and special beverage of Janakpur. It’s not only a beverage, rather it contains geographical and cultural identity as well as the emotional attachment.
The provincial and local governments and business forums in Janakpur should promote and encourage Lassi business from tourism, cultural and economic development perspective. They should promote Lassi globally and domestically to fetch domestic as well as international tourists. The central, provincial and local government should highlight the importance of Lassi on their official websites as well as social media platforms. Social media users should promote Lassi from their respective platforms. Even the hotels and restaurants in Janakpur should advertise Lassi and serve it in their hotels. The government should keep the pamphlet of Janakpuria Lassi in both Tribhuvan International Airport as well as domestic airport of Janakpur which will help international as well as domestic tourists to acquire knowledge about it. Every flight for Janakpur from Kathmandu should distribute a pamphlet informing the traveler about Janakpuria Lassi.

Kathmandu, 6 January (2020) – Lal Kishore Sah, Janakpurdham Sub-metropolitan City Mayor, beat up journalists in his office on Tuesday.
The journalists had reached Mayor’s office to take his comment on land encroachment in Janaki Temple. Sah is accused of closing the door and asking goons to beat up the journalists.
Anil Mishra, President of Dhanusha District Chapter of Federation of Nepali Journalists, Amar Kanta Amar, Bikas Sah, Raja Jha, Sumit Mishra, Subas Karna and Shatrudhan Yadav have been beaten up.
“The Mayor used goons who beat us up with helmets and pipes,” journalist Mishra said.
Journalists have been protesting the attack.
Mayor Sah
Journalist Bikas Sah of AP1 TV told Lokantar about the incident:
We had gone to the sub-metropolitan office to take mayor’s byte. He kept us waiting for three hours.
Party activists were allowed in but we had to wait outside. We waited for him till 1 pm.
But the mayor still didn’t let us in. Then Amar Kanta Amar burst into anger and said, “You say there is a meeting but party activists have been going in and coming out. Why don’t you give us time?”
But we didn’t receive any answer. Then we entered inside. There was no meeting as such. Former President of FNJ Ashok Rauniyar was inside.
As we entered inside the mayor asked us, “Have you prior appointment?”
Amar said that they had come to take a quote from the mayor. My cameraman also asked for a byte. I didn’t say anything.
Then the mayor said, “You have been spreading terror in the name of media.”
Amar said, “Our former president is here. What terror have we spread?”
Then the mayor’s followers and metropolitan police barged into the room and started to rough us up. They beat up Amar. Then they shoved me.
Manhandling continued for 15 minutes. They forced us out of the office and we staged a sit-in outside the mayor’s room.
Chaos ensued after that. No one knew who was pummelling whom.
They beat us up with pipes and helmets. Amar’s head is wounded. Sumit Mishra was beaten up with a pipe.
They even snatched our camera and have not returned it.

Kathmandu, 6 January (2020) – Thrashed at the hands of his computer teacher, Taufiq Dhuniya refuses to go to school.
Dhuniya studies at Gyandeep Boarding School in Sammarimai Rural Municipality-6 in Rupandehi district in Province-5. Computer teacher Shailendra Barai beat him up mercilessly on Wednesday for not doing the homework.
Dhuniya spoke with Lokantar Monday morning. He said, “I don’t want to go to school. The teacher may beat me up again. He struck me with a wooden stick on my left eye and on my back. He had beaten me up in other parts but the marks have slowly disappeared. I wish that the teacher stops coming to the school.”
Taufiq’s house is in Pokharhama village in Sammarimai.
“The teacher thrashed five of my friends as well. The school closed from the day of the incident. It opened on Sunday. But I didn’t attend classes and will not go to school today as well. I am afraid to go there,” Dhuniya said.
Dhuniya is in the fifth standard and is known as one of the disciplined students.
Surendra Barai, the school principal, refused to comment on the incident. Lokantar phoned him to take a comment but he asked to call later. However, he didn’t take the call later.

Kathmandu, 31 December (2019) – Sugarcane farmers from Sarlahi district in eastern Tarai have come to Kathmandu after being deprived of payments from the sugar mills.
These agitating farmers have met Minister of Agriculture Ghanshyam Bhusal and opposition party leader Gagan Thapa in vain.
Sugarcane farmers have been demonstrating at Maitighar Mandala which is at a stone’s throw from government secretariat Singh Durbar every day for the last two weeks. But there is no guarantee that they will get the payment they have been deprived of for the last five years.
The farmers say, “The government does not hear the voice of the farmers when they are alive. It may hear them after they have died.”
Raudi Mahato has come to Kathmandu from Sisautiya, Godaita Municipality in Sarlahi district. He told Lokantar, “No one hears our voice. I don’t know the minister. I am a simple farmer. I have come here because I heard that the government is nearby.”
Other farmers echo Raudi’s expression and say that they should get all due payments. Raudi Mahato has pasted a paper on his chest which reads, “Promptly pay the farmers.”
Sugar mill operators bought sugarcanes from the fields of the farmers but did not pay them for a long time. Mahato and other farmers have been agitating in Kathmandu cold to get those dues.
The whole day Mahato attends the sit-in at Maitighar and also goes to meet the political leaders. He goes to the rented room of his relative at night for the shelter.
He said that he did not have full stomach for the last few days due to the lack of money.
He said, “I don’t have any money. It’s been 15 days since I came to Kathmandu. I have taken shelter at a room of a villager. He is an old goods scavenger. I take a little food in the morning and attend the demonstration the whole day.”
Mahato has a wife, four sons and a daughter. Sugarcane farming is the main source of his earning.
He has only five katthas of land in his name. He has taken lease of two bigahas of land for sugarcane farming and has to pay the landlord. Sugar mill has not paid him any money so he has not been able to pay the landlord as well.
Annapurna Sugar Mill of Sarlahi district bought sugarcane from Mahato for the last four years but has not paid him any money. “I have to take around 400,000 rupees from the sugar mill. How can I pay the landlord in this situation?” Mahato asks.
Mahato says that he will not do sugarcane farming in others’ lands if the government facilitates farmers’ due payment. He says that even paddy farming has made his sustenance difficult.
“I have resolved to stay here till I get the payment, I may even die here,” Mahato told Lokantar. “The government may hear our voice while we are alive, otherwise it will hear us after we die. I am ready to sacrifice my life but will not go home without the payment.”
Pradeep Mukhiya of Basbariya Rural Municipality studies at the undergraduate level in Trichandra College. He has skipped classes and is participating in the agitation at Maitighar after his fellow villagers came to Kathmandu for due payment. He said that he had come to the demonstration because his father did not get due payments for sugarcane.
Mukhiya said that they have expressed their pain at the Ministry of Agriculture but have not received any concrete answer. “The minister eats rice, lentils and oil produced in our village, he may listen to us,” Mukhiya said with hope.
Annapurna Sugar Mill had made a written agreement with the farmers to pay all dues within September this year but failed to honour the agreement, Mukhiya said.
Around 25 sugarcanes farmers from Sarlahi district have been demonstrating at Maitighar Mandala for the last 15 days. These farmers are catching cold.

Nepal is agitated after the government of India released its political map keeping Kalapani area in its side. Four days after the release of the Indian map, Nepal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) released a press statement objecting to India’s incorporation of Kalapani in its map. However, the press statement seems immature as there is no authorized signature underneath. Similarly, the language used in the statement does not give clear message regarding Nepal’s stance.
Meantime, Raveesh Kumar, Official Spokesperson of Ministry of External Affairs of India, has clearly said that the map released by India is accurate and Kalapani comes under the territory of India. Some Nepali leaders are invoking the Sugauli Treaty of 1816 forged between Nepal and the then East India Company regarding control on Kalapani. Government of Nepal in the face of anti-Indian sentiments should handle the situation smartly and commit to smooth running of Nepal-India relationship.
Three things regarding this dispute need to be pondered upon: vandalism orchestrated by student and youth wings of Nepali Congress (NC) and Nepal Communist Party (NCP), NCP government’s inaction and mysterious silence of Nepal government over Chinese encroachment of Nepali land.
Last week onwards youth leaders of NC and NCP have been demonstrating against the political map of India, objecting to placement of Kalapani inside India. But their modus operandi is quite objectionable. Chanting slogans like “Back off India” and abusing Indian citizens in Nepal are offensive acts. Burning the effigy of Indian Prime Minister and vandalizing the gate of the Embassy of India will not help solve the issue. Such acts of NC and NCP have disgraced Nepali leaders at the global arena. Rather than pouring venom on India, youth leaders of leading political parties should ask their leaders how they allowed Kalapani to be a part of India. What were they doing when China and India came to Kalapani border?
Coinciding with recent brouhaha on Kalapani, several media outlets have published accounts of China encroaching upon Nepali land in Sankhuwasabha, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Humla districts. A news website in Nepal has mentioned that ‘around six hectors of land in the Bhagdare River in Humla district and four hectors of land in Karnali have been encroached upon by China’. The news portal has published the news story on the basis of data obtained from Department of Survey. Nepal’s silence over Chinese aggression is deafening. The scribe does not intend to say that Nepal can allow any country to encroach upon its land just because another country has done it. However, staking claim of Nepali sovereignty must not be selective.

The reason for Nepal government not being able to stand its ground is because of Chinese domination. China also has its deep concerns regarding Kalapani, Lipu-lekh and Limpiyadhura dispute. In such scenario, Nepal speaking up can ire China as well. Those areas are immensely critical from security point of view and Nepal needs to think twice before taking any steps. It should point out China as an aggressor like India.
I think Nepal government must have known that just a couple of days ago few members of Chinese think tank and director of Shanghai-based China Institute of Fudan were in Nepal and they said that India has encroached upon China’s land too. Is it a good time to organize such dialogue programme in Nepal? Or is this China’s strategy to add fuel to the fire?
Government of Nepal needs to do two major things as soon as possible. First, the government should not allow any unwanted activities against its southern neighbour. The government must be careful to stop any sponsored agitation against India. Second, Prime Minister KP Oli must be serious in commencing dialogue with India rather than uttering irresponsible statements for public consumption.
Nepal should not allow one neighbour to score brownie points against the other. It needs to maintain equidistance with both its neighbours.

The recently released new map of India has stirred an old controversy between India and Nepal over a small 35 sq km disputed area claimed by both countries. India considers Kalapani as part of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district, and Nepal as part of its Darchula district. The recent map, released to depict the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir, has resulted in several protests in Nepal by students’ unions and political parties. The leaders have reached out to Indian officials in Kathmandu. New Delhi, on its part, has maintained that the new map does not revise the existing boundary with Nepal and that it “accurately depicts the sovereign territory of India”. As such, there is no change in the status quo, it says.
The incident brings to the fore two kinds of narratives. The first is one of cartographic aggression, as perceived by most sections in Nepal. The second relates to the larger behaviour of a modern State in its march to consolidating its power and sovereignty. While both these perceptions have been debunked by India on the ground that India only carried out a cartographic depiction of its legitimate and sovereign area on the map and that no violations of Nepal’s sovereignty had taken place, there is a need to debate the issue in the context of its larger implications for bilateral relations between India and Nepal.
It is understandable why Nepal would tend to think so. Power, capabilities and force projection are very closely linked with State behaviour, especially when contested geographies are involved. In the current century, China has led from the front in establishing a predictable relationship between force projection and contested sovereignties. This has induced apprehension among small countries, especially those overwhelmingly close to a big and powerful neighbour. As such, Nepal’s anxiety of India’s cartographic aggression emanates less from concrete developments on the ground and more from the broader trends in State behaviour worldwide.
History of the dispute 
In 1816, the East India Company and Nepal signed the Treaty of Sagauli to mark out Nepal’s western border. The treaty defined river Mahakali as the western border of Nepal. River Mahakali has several tributaries, all of which merge at Kalapani. India claims that the river begins in Kalapani as this is where all its tributaries merge. But Nepal claims that it begins from Lipulekh Pass, the origin of most of its tributaries. It has therefore laid claim to all areas east of the Lipu Gad — the rivulet that joins the river Kali on its border. According to Nepal, the Kalapani area was included in the Census of Nepal until 58 years ago. According to some quarters, the late Nepalese King Mahendra had “handed over the territory” to India in 1962 in the wake of the India-China war. A report submitted on the subject to the Nepali prime minister further claimed that India had occupied an additional 62 sq km land. India on its part has presented administrative and tax records dating back to 1830s to back its claims. A map of 1879 also shows Kalapani as part of British India.
It is interesting to note that this long-standing issue only gained prominence after India and Nepal signed the Treaty of Mahakali in 1996. Both countries have been trying to resolve the issue of Kalapani and another vast area along the Nepal-Uttar Pradesh border, Susta. In 1981, a Joint Technical Boundary Committee was formed. While it could resolve a large part of the dispute, no final settlement could be reached. The progress in the matter has been very slow. In 2014, both countries held a joint commission meeting led by their foreign ministers. In 2016, an Eminent Persons Group was formed to look into several bilateral issues, including the border dispute and the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950. The border issue was escalated in March 2017 when a Nepali was killed as India’s Border Security Forces opened fire in Kanchanpur district, near the Nepal-India border
Incidentally, Kalapani is a trijunction meeting point of India, Tibet and Nepal borders. The region has been manned by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police since 1962. This has led to fear of Chinese involvement also. Nepal has also raised concern over Lipulekh Pass, which has been made a trading tri-junction route between India and China, reportedly without Nepal’s consent, since 2015. The Indian side claims that Lipulekh pass has been referred to as a border trading point since 1954 and that the new positions depict an anti-Indian sentiment to gain greater political mileage.
The flaring up of this issue is bound to add further tension in the India-Nepal relationship. The ties had received an impetus when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014. Nepal was invited as a SAARC member for Modi’s swearing-in ceremony. Modi visited the Himalayan nation soon after announcing his ‘neighbourhood first’ commitment. India was quick to respond to the earthquake that ravaged Nepal in 2015. It is another matter that the narrative from our chest-thumping media drew flak from several quarters. Nepal also continued to blame India for interfering in its internal matters. The relationship deteriorated considerably after the unofficial blockade of Nepal in 2015.
Despite this, India still enjoys great leverage with Nepal. India is Nepal’s largest trading partner, and the two countries are culturally intertwined. In the past, India has played a considerable role in maintaining stability and development in Nepal. As China’s clout grows in the region and India’s tensions with Pakistan exacerbate, India needs friends in the neighbourhood. It is therefore imperative that India manages such incidents with diplomatic finesse so that an anti-India feeling does not emerge among the Nepali leaders and general populace.

Chhangru Village
Kathmandu, 10 November (2019) – Nepali people are angry with the newly published political map of India that shows Nepali territory of Lipu-lekh and Kalapani inside India.
Kalapani, Lipu-lekh and Limpiyadhura are in Byas Rural Municipality of Darchula district in far western province of Nepal. India has illegally encroached upon those lands and has forbidden Nepali people to go there. Nepalis have to obtain a permit card to go to the Nepali territories that are miles away from lands which India has encroached upon.
Many Nepalis do not know the real condition of Kalapani and Lipu-lekh. But India has been in control of these territories for the last six decades. Lokantar has talked with Dilip Budhathoki, Chairperson of Byas Rural Municipality about these forgotten territories. Excerpts follow:
India has issued permit cards
Lipu-lekh and Kalapani are completely under India’s control. They have been in control of these lands since 1962 and Nepal has not made its presence felt.
Chhangru village is some 17 kilometres far from Kalapani and that is the last Nepali village not under India’s control. Chhangru is in Ward no. 1 in Byas Rural Municipality.
We have to obtain permit cards from the Indian administration to go to Chhangru. Nepali citizens cannot enter Kalapani. Indians don’t give pass to go to Kalapani. It is off-limits for Nepali people.
Indian Army and Seema Suraksha Bal have settled in Kalapani. Some civilians are there to do business.
Our roads to Chhangru are bad. So, we have to use Indian roads. It takes a whole day to reach Chhangru from the district headquarters of Darchula. Half the vehicle journey needs to be done through Indian roads while half the journey requires trekking. Once we reach Sitapul (Seeta Bridge) through Indian roads, we have to cross a wooden bridge and then reach Chhangru.
Seeta Bridge
Tinker Pass is above Chhangru. The pillar demarcating Nepal-China border is there. Our business border with China is Tinker Pass.
Nepali roads to Tinker Pass are bad. We can reach there only on foot. Since it is difficult to use mule as beast of burden on these roads, there is no alternative to Indian roads for travel.
Following the local level elections, we have been prioritizing construction of roads to Tinker Pass. But in lack of human settlement and due to geographical difficulty, we have not been able to make roads. That area is vulnerable to floods and landslips in the rainy season.
During India-China War in 1961 the then King Mahendra allowed to Indians to make a temporary base in Kalapani. But India never went away since then. Indian Army has made a permanent base there.
Indian administration’s condescending attitude
No problem exists at the civilian level. People from the same community live both sides of the border.
Indigenous people live in both Chhangru and Tinker and similar people live across the border as well. Local people have cordial relationship but Indian administration shows condescending attitude.
They have not subjected me to any untoward behaviour. But their attitude to Nepali people is not good. There are many complaints regarding India’s patronising tendency.
On Lipu-lekh
Limpiyadhura and Lipu-lekh are also under Indian control. It is believed that Sage Byas wrote some scripts (lipi) at Lipu-lekh before going to Mansarovar to do penance. But these scripts are not available now.
Lipu-lekh is a trilateral border point among Nepal, India and China. But India has encroached upon Nepali territory for decades. They have been using the border point to conduct trade with China.
The zero (0) pillar demarcating trilateral border is missing. People say that it used to exist but we never saw it.
Tinker Village
All eastern lands from Kali River is Nepali territory. Lipu-lekh is the originating place of Kali River. Nepali villages including Kuti, Nabi, Gunji used to be there.
A small stream merges with Kali River in Kalapani and Indians claim that it is the source of Kali River. On this basis they have encroached upon Nepal’s lands westward from that stream.
No security personnel
Armed Police Force has the mandate to protect borders but they don’t go beyond Khalanga, headquarters of Darchula district. Nepal Army’s base in also in the headquarters. Chhayalek Police Station is around a kilometre away from Tinker Village. Police personnel don’t stay there during winter. Even the locals come down for six months during winter.
There is another police outpost in Sitapul. Policemen in Chhayalek have already come down to Sitapul. During high winter, they come down even lower at a place called Dumling.
Nepal remains absent even in Nepali territory for six months.
After getting elected to the post of Rural Municipality Chief, I approached the Ministry of Home Affairs with the demand of erecting armed police post in Chhangru. The Ministry has approved my request but there are delays in erecting the post.
We have demanded a permanent outpost of Armed Police Force in Chhangru.
Kalapani and Lipu-lekh are our territories
India has to correct its map. Nepal Government has to ask the Indian government to amend the map and also ensure Nepal’s permanent presence in Kalapani area. It is the duty of the federal government to protect international border.
The federal government also needs to construct Khalanga-Tinker road so that Nepali people do not have to obtain permit cards from the Indians to go to their own lands.

Lachu Adhikari and his family relocated six years ago to Charlotte from a refugee camp in Nepal.
For the first time in his life, he had a place to call home — a far cry from the cramped bamboo hut he shared with his parents and two younger siblings in a village with no electricity and limited access to running water.
Today, Adhikari, a 20-year-old sophomore at The University of North Carolina at Pembroke, has a new lease on life. But his heart remains with the Nepalese people, especially the children who lack adequate medical care. Adhikari chose UNCP to further his education with the goal of one day returning to his country as a pediatrician.
“As a refugee, you see people dying and suffering from different kinds of disease,” he said. “That’s when I decided, I want to be a doctor to help the children in my community who don’t receive the proper nutrients.”
Adhikari’s journey to UNCP has been nothing short of amazing. He was born at the Beldangi camp in Jhapa near the Indian border. The camp provided water two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon. Oil lamps lit the huts at night. Accidental fires are all too common. Camp volunteers provide education through the 10th grade. After enduring such harsh conditions for 20 years, Adhikari’s parents sought help from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to come to the United States.
At 14, Adhikari couldn’t speak any English when he arrived in Charlotte. With help from volunteers Noel and Karen Sweezy he began applying for colleges while attending Garinger High School.
The culture shock was just beginning to wear off when he packed his belongings for a new culture in Pembroke.
“I chose UNCP because I didn’t want to be too far from my parents,” he said. “The professors here are great. I really enjoy the classes and the student-to-professor ratio. I like the one-on-one time with my professors.”
At UNCP, Adhikari is self-disciplined with regard to his studies, finding little time for leisure outside of the men’s club soccer team and serving as a Braves Ambassador with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
“Right now, I’m focused on getting my BSN degree, then I will begin researching medical schools. I want go back to Nepal at some point, open a clinic and offer free checkups. My people are still recovering from the earthquake in 2015. I can’t just sit back and watch my country suffer.”

When Shyam “San” Rai was 8 years old, he and his family were forced out of Bhutan by the government and relocated to a refugee camp in the nearby nation of Nepal. Food was scarce, he remembers, and survival was hard.
Rai lived in the refugee camp for 22 years before he moved to the United States in 2011. He settled in Utica, New York, dubbed “The Town That Loves Refugees” by the magazine of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
There, he joined many refugees—including others who, like himself, hailed from the countries of Nepal and Bhutan. These two South Asian nations, bordering Tibet, share a population of refugees with mixed ancestry—linked to both Nepal and Bhutan—that has experienced statelessness and discrimination within both countries.
“Some people say, ‘We are Bhutanese because we were born in Bhutan and our nationality is Bhutanese,’” says Rai. “Other people say, ‘Our forefathers are from Nepal, and we speak Nepali, we eat Nepali food, and we celebrate Nepali culture.’”
Rai’s approach to self-naming is common in the Bhutanese Nepali communities of the United States. “It’s flexible. It’s a ‘both-and’ as opposed to an ‘either-or’ identity,” says Andrew Nelson of the University of North Texas, Denton. Nelson and fellow cultural anthropologist Kathryn Stam of the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute, Utica, are studying the roots of this flexibility.
Names often tell a story. And Stam and Nelson have found the names used by the Bhutanese Nepali community are no exception. Some names encode historical migrations, as is the case for the Bhutanese Nepali community. In addition, names can reflect “othering” in which dominant powers seek to differentiate refugees from the rest of a population in a region or nation. Resettlement and citizenship in new lands, meanwhile, present new opportunities for refugees to name themselves.
Bhutanese Nepali naming, then, offers a window into a refugee experience and the community’s century-long narrative of resilience. Today, as vulnerable populations migrate across the globe in search of better lives, that narrative is a timely reminder of the complexity of defining nationality, particularly for groups who have experienced statelessness.
Migration is central to the Bhutanese Nepali refugees’ story. Until 1992, Rai’s parents were farmers in Bhutan. They grew rice and vegetables, such as corn and zucchini, to sell at the market. But his forefathers were originally from Nepal, and Rai grew up speaking Nepali.
In fact, many families migrated from feudalist Nepal to Bhutan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as farmers. There, they were known as Lhotshampas, or “Southerners,” in Bhutan’s national language, Dzongkha, because they lived in southern Bhutan.
But the Bhutanese government, from the late 1970s until the 1990s, made it more difficult for people with Nepali ancestry to remain. Thousands of people relocated to refugee camps in Nepal. Many of these refugees embraced aspects of their ancestral Nepali culture. But they were not fully welcomed in Nepal, despite their roots. Many could not own land or become Nepali citizens. As refugees, they became Bhutanese or “Bhutani,” in the Nepali language, Nelson says.
“Being forced into highly regulated refugee camps in Nepal forged a collective identity which was often in resistance to the larger political structure,” Nelson says. That spirit would contribute to the refugees’ flexibility in naming as they resettled once again.
Since 2007, more than 100,000 Bhutanese refugees moved from Nepal to other countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. A new chapter of migration unfolded in U.S. cities like Utica and Fort Worth as these refugees studied, got jobs, and shared their culture with the wider community.
Rai, for example, took English classes at the refugee center in Utica. He initially worked at a nearby casino before taking his current job at Chobani, the yogurt company, where he cleans production equipment.
Rai also joined a folk band in Utica, playing the madal hand drum and sharing traditional Nepali songs he learned in the refugee camps. For several years, the band played at schools, museums, and cultural festivals sprinkled throughout the hillsides of central New York. Rai and Stam, who managed the group, became friends.
Stam and Nelson have been studying Bhutanese Nepali refugee communities in New York and Texas, respectively, for years. Nelson has interviewed and observed more than 40 families in Fort Worth’s community since 2015.
In his writing, Nelson uses the term Nepali Bhutanese rather than Bhutanese Nepali—though both anthropologists say either order is accurate. (Nelson adds, “This very question is how our work on this topic started!”)
Stam, meanwhile, is the president of the board of the Midtown Utica Community Center, which serves refugees in the area. She has documented several aspects of the resettlement experience in studies and for the Refugees Starting Over project.
“Bhutanese Nepali refugees have this really complicated relationship with identity,” Stam says. She adds that their flexible identity is unique among the many refugee communities living in Utica.
The Karen, for example, may have relocated from Burma, but they dislike being called “Burmese,” in part because it connects them to that nation’s military, which oppressed their ethnic group. Refugees from Somalia, meanwhile, hold rigid rules about the use of names such as Bantu and Kizigua, which reference ethnic groups and their nomadic traditions back in Africa. And they may find it offensive to be called “Somali” because of their history of conflict with this group.
“One generalization that we can make is that the practice of naming or any sort of practice of readjustment when moving into a new society is a political statement of sorts,” Nelson says. “It’s a way of negotiating new structures through strategies.” For the Bhutanese Nepali, these strategies have been developed over multiple migrations.
Names tell a story. The names used by the Bhutanese Nepali community are no exception.
Naming can be strategic, in recognition of a particular audience and its expectations. People may say that they are Nepali because their classmates or co-workers have more familiarity with Nepal than Bhutan, for example.
Sometimes the choice in name reflects specific activities or circumstances. People in these communities may call themselves Nepali when they eat food like dal bhat (a traditional rice and lentil meal) and wear traditional Nepali clothes, Stam notes.
And Stam has noticed a generational fault line in the refugee communities from Nepal and Bhutan. Older refugees born in Bhutan are more likely to prefer identifying as Bhutanese, and they are more likely to talk about the loss of their Bhutanese home and life than younger refugees. They may also, in her observations, be less comfortable with flexible labels than younger refugees.
Rai, 34, says his identity lends itself to very long conversations. Initially, he may tell someone that he is from his birthplace, Bhutan, but then he will explain that he’s from Nepal if that person is eager to know more about his home.
And Rai recognizes other generational shifts underway. He has a 2-year-old son and a newborn daughter; he wants his children to embrace their American roots while still honoring their Nepali culture.
“They belong to the United States, so I think they’re going to say, ‘I’m from the United States,’” says Rai. He hopes his children will speak English and Nepali, and he intends to tell them the story of his early life in Bhutan. “I don’t want them to forget their culture,” he says, echoing a sentiment held by refugees and migrants the world over.

Breathtaking images of snow-capped mountains taken in Nepal’s Nubri Valley, an isolated area 4,000 metres (13,000 feet) above sea level in the Himalayas bordering Tibet, cover the windows of Cathryn Donohue’s room at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).
“Mount Manaslu is the world’s eighth tallest peak and it’s so beautiful, especially when the sun lights it up like a volcano,” says Donohue, assistant professor of the university’s linguistics department, pointing to a picture of the mountain that presides over the valley. “Nubri Valley is on the Manaslu circuit trek, and while it’s not on travellers’ radar like the well-worn Annapurna circuit in central Nepal, it’s getting more popular.”
Donohue, an Australian who has been to the Nubri Valley about eight times, is well informed about the place and the Nubri people, who are believed to have settled in the valley from Tibet about 400 years ago. But her speciality is the language of Nubri, spoken only by about 2,000 ethnically Tibetan people and which has no written form.
“A quarter of the population in Nubri Valley is monolingual – there’s no English, no Nepali,” she says.
She explains that it is the isolation of the area – which was hit by a powerful earthquake in 2015 that either damaged or destroyed 80 per of the homes in its villages – that has long protected the Nubri language from being influenced by the national language.
“It’s very remote, about a week’s walk from one end to the other. The trek is challenging – narrow and steep – and unless you’re carrying something heavy like rice that requires mules, then it’s walking all the way, usually climbing about 500 metres a day.”
But changing times means the Nubri people’s language is under threat, with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) having it on its list of “definitely endangered” languages – meaning its future is uncertain.
One of the main reasons is societal change as a growing number of young people swap a traditional life of subsistence farming in the valley for school in the capital, Kathmandu, where Nepali is the language of instruction.
“Following in their parents’ footsteps and working on farms, or wearing traditional dress – this is not the lifestyle the younger generation wants, and it’s this change that is bringing about the language shift towards Nepali,” Donohue says. “For young people, Nepali represents all the socioeconomic opportunities they would not have if they stayed in the valley.”
Technology is also fuelling the shift, as more young people use Nepali and English on smartphones and social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook.
“Nubri has no written language, which means it’s very easy to lose. In fact it’s possible that in a generation the language will be gone,” Donohue says, adding that currently, on average, a language is lost once every fortnight worldwide.
Understanding the vital role language plays in a culture and its identity, Donohue was determined to help preserve Nubri by introducing a writing system, a proven step towards language preservation and improved literacy.
“It could be a cool secret language and could be something to latch on to as part of their identity. Something the people of the valley can be proud of,” she says.
The Nubri Language Project was born, with Donohue taking on the role of language diplomat as a “passive observer”.
“Obviously, I’m not going to tell young Nubris to adopt the way of life of previous generations. And nobody would deny them the opportunities in front of them,” she says. “But the big challenge is how to move forward in a way that’s inevitable while retaining a language.”
Creating and documenting a community-endorsed written language had its challenges, the biggest of which was finding a way to bring together villagers who were scattered across locations four to five days’ trek apart.
“A writing system is only successful if the whole community is on board. We needed to give villagers a reason to come together and discuss how we could create this writing system, to provide an incentive.”
That’s when Donohue had a light-bulb moment: to create the valley’s first eye clinic project, specialising in the screening and removal of cataracts, a condition that causes clouding of the eye’s natural lens and results in blurred vision.
“Health care services in the valley are poor and I noticed a lot of elderly people had cataracts that were not treated because financial or physical constraints prevented them from making the long and expensive journey to Kathmandu. Plus there were other issues, like who would look after the land and animals while the farmers made the two-to-three-week round trip?
“Setting up free and more conveniently located eye clinics throughout the valley was a unique opportunity for these farmers.”
Logistics also proved challenging, but the path was smoothed when one of Donohue’s previous projects, in Bhutan, where she studied the Bumthang language, led to a connection with respected Nepalese ophthalmologist Dr Sanduk Ruit.
Known locally as the “God of Sight”, Ruit has restored the vision of more than 130,000 people across Africa and Asia using small-incision cataract surgery. He is also a founder of the Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology in Kathmandu.
“Dr Ruit is well known for his outreach work in Africa and I was so happy that he and the Tilganga Institute agreed to do the project,” Donohue says.
“It was such a blessing to have someone of his calibre get involved. If he was not on board it would have been a long process involving a lot of administration work arranging overseas medical permits and paperwork – a real nightmare. But it all fell into place and I now count these familiar faces as friends and not just distant colleagues. It really could not have worked out better.”
In May, a team of ophthalmologists, with financial support from an HKU grant, packed helicopters with equipment and medicine and set up six free clinics for eye care and cataract surgery throughout the valley.
“The team was familiar with the conditions in these remote villages and how to prep for surgery – it took a whole day just to sterilise one room for surgery,” Donohue says. “And because the doctors and their team were from Kathmandu, and not outsiders, it was easy for patients to respond.”
Almost 500 patients from the valley were screened for cataracts and other ailments, resulting in cataract removal surgery for 51 villagers. Cataract surgery involves replacing the cloudy lens with an artificial one, done under local anaesthetic.
“People came from all over the valley, some walking for days,” Donohue says. “Some were blind in both eyes, and were carried by family members.” One 78-year-old woman who underwent cataract surgery had been blind for six years. To get to the clinic, her nephew carried her on his back for five days.
Agreeing on a common written language was another challenge, one complicated by dialect variation within the valley that had been recently discovered. It is a slow and methodical process, Donohue says, one that calls for cultural sensitivity and diplomacy.
“The community as a whole had to endorse and agree which writing system would best suit the whole region, and bringing people together via the clinics made this possible.”
Donohue’s ongoing work has catalogued the only recorded samples of the language.
“I have a lot of recordings but it takes time transcribing Nubri and English. There will be video with subtitles – eventually it will be deposited in an archive.”
Like her brother, renowned linguist Mark Donohue – who has worked on languages of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Nepal and Bhutan – Donohue’s focus has long been on Sino-Tibetan languages. One project she is working on is close to Hong Kong’s heart.
“I’m working on some indigenous Hong Kong dialects that existed before what we know as Cantonese,” she says. “I want to understand the social factors behind language change, in particular loss. I love studying tone, so Hong Kong is perfect for me.”

For some thinking Indians, President Xi Jinping flying straight from Chennai to Kathmandu was provocative, even an affront to India. This is incomprehensible. Nepal has been waiting for Xi since 2014, his trips being periodically postponed. He had been waiting for the right timing: For Nepal to have a full-fledged communist government with a massive and unprecedented electoral majority that would allow the Nepal Communist Party leader and prime minister, Khadga Prasad Oli, to pick Beijing over New Delhi, the dominant power for decades. India’s marginalisation in Nepal — which is geo-strategically vital in its security calculus — is largely self-inflicted: Clumsy diplomacy. In his first term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose Nepal for his first visit, when he mesmerised Nepalis of all shades with his promise of resetting India-Nepal relations. That never happened and the rest is history.
Then, Xi came calling. His visit was meticulously planned: Preceded by visits of foreign minister Wang Yi, a 40-member delegation of the Communist Party of China, carrying Xi Jinping Thought for exchanges with Nepal’s Communist Party, and, a signed article by Xi which appeared in Nepali newspapers, tracing the historical and cultural links in the China-Nepal relationship which he wished to upgrade to long-term strategic and security cooperation. He pledged to safeguard Nepal’s national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. The entire Nepal cabinet, led by Oli and president Bidya Bhandari, was present to give a reception no foreign visitor has received in recent times.
As in the past, the deliverables in the 18 agreements and two letters of exchange were not as spectacular as was expected. Boundary Management Systems — which helps insulate China’s northern reaches with Nepal — is a perennial issue relating to the illegal passage of Tibetans. China’s main security concern relates to anti-China activities by 20,000 Tibetans living in Nepal who are virtually under lockdown during such visits. Mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, which Beijing hopes will ultimately result in an extradition treaty, figured prominently. Xi also announced a financial assistance package of $495 mn for the next two years which India will find difficult to match. Already China has overtaken India in FDI to Nepal which was about $300 mn in 2018. The feasibility study for Cross Himalayan Connectivity Network of a railway from Kyirong to Kathmandu was approved.
This will ultimately be extended via Pokhara to Lumbini in Terai as the China-Nepal Economic Corridor component of the Belt and Road Initiative. A preliminary study by China Railway First Survey and Design Institute Group Co Ltd has noted formidable technical, geological, scientific and engineering challenges to this, including its security along with high costs and risks that far outweigh the benefits. One estimate puts the cost of the Kathmandu-Kyirong section which includes a 28 km tunnel at $2.7 bn. The question of funding invokes in the minds of the Nepalese, the Hambantota debt trap. A railway line from Lhasa to Kathmandu, unless it reaches the border with India, makes little commercial sense. On the other hand, it will raise strategic doubts and uncertainties between New Delhi and Beijing given the taut state of current relations.
Nepal, of course, does not view the CNEC as a threat but an opportunity for it to play the bridge between the two fastest growing economies, China and India. King Prithvi Narayan Shah, founder of Nepal, had said in 1770 that Nepal is a root vegetable between two big boulders, calling for balance and equidistance, which has never been possible. Given the great rise of China, and its involvement in Nepal’s domestic politics, Kathmandu may be forced to make major strategic choices. In the past, former prime ministers, Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda and Babu Ram Bhattarai, had sought to encourage India to join the triangular India-Nepal-China grouping. In 2016, at Kathmandu’s behest, the three countries did discuss it. But India shied away, preferring to deal bilaterally with Nepal like other countries in the neighbourhood. After Wuhan, then Chinese Ambassador to India, Luo Zhaohui had mooted ‘China-India-plus one’ as a new model, as the two countries agreed to jointly train Afghan diplomats. He was aiming for India-China-Nepal; the idea regurgitated by Xi was to also include Pakistan as plus one.
In his banquet speech, Xi emphasised that the Cross-Himalayan Connectivity Network will help Nepal become land-linked from land-locked with additional entry points, alluding to reducing dependence on India. According to Chinese media, Xi told Oli that anyone attempting to split China will have “crushed bodies and shattered bones”, an unveiled message for “splittists” — Hong Kong included. Xi chose Nepal, a country which has sought to be a zone of peace, because it is regarded as a window to Tibet.
Given its new pre-eminence in Nepal and deep pockets, Beijing has sought parity with India including enhanced defence and military cooperation as part of the new blueprint in Nepal-China relations, which, for the first time, have become strategic. The CNEC is more strategic than economic, especially its envisaged outreach to Lumbini which will breach India’s red line on Chinese activities in Nepal. New Delhi has completed its feasibility study of a railway line from Raxaul to Kathmandu. How the Kathmandu-Kyirong rail will connect with the Indian section to the south, given the different railway gauges, is unclear. The Indian military still views a PLA challenge, both overt and covert, through Nepal to the strategic Indo-Gangetic plains, as very real. Very recently, a conference was held by the Army to consider the military implications of China’s enhanced presence and influence in Nepal.
Xi’s dream — to be the sole leader of the Asian century — is attainable: By keeping India anchored to the region using Pakistan, even as Beijing, assisted by Kathmandu, blocks New Delhi’s traditional strategic space in Nepal. But, not all is lost for India. Geography, including the open border, for one, is in India’s favour. Winning back Nepal and the confidence of its people is the challenge.

Kathmandu, 25 November (2019) – In a series of debates and talk programs designed to stimulate thinking and get the ideas and knowledge flowing, on Sunday a joint event was organized by the French Embassy in Nepal and BEED Knowledge Center on the “Future of Compassion in the context of Artificial Intelligence and Technology” in which the French Buddhist monk and writer, Matthieu Ricard, was in conversation with Sujeev Shakya.
During the conversation, Ricard admired the resilience of Nepali people as they get through everything in life. There has not been lasting hatred and believes that it is a part of the Nepali culture.
Ricard highlighted that a common platform, even before religion, is goodness and a good heart which is most needed for people to come together despite the challenges of technology.  In Ricard’s point of view, artificial intelligence is a method of calculation and not a being and hence no element of experience.
For Sujeev, a lot of evolution has taken place over the years and although Buddhism and science have evolved to come together, it has always been about the human mind and people.  Sujeev emphasized that, technology has encroached our life in an unprecedented level, resulting a conflict with our notion of a shared world and a shared future.
The conversation started with the French Ambassador to Nepal, Mr. François – Xavier LEGER giving the opening remarks.
The conversation would be available online at the Embassy’s and BEED’s websites in the beginning of December.
The attendees included Heads of Mission and representatives from various embassies, researchers, students and people from the private sector.
The French Embassy and the BEED Knowledge Center thank Bidhata KC for providing the art works, Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha for curating and Karuna-Shechan for supporting the event as well as Hotel Himalaya for kindly hosting the event.

China is encroaching into Nepal’s land through an ongoing road expansion project in Tibet, Nepal’s Survey Department has said.
A detailed report issued by the department said that around 36 hectors of land in four different districts, including Sankhuwasabha, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Humla, which touch the Chinese border.
A data revealed that around six hectors of land in the Bhagdare River in the Humla district and four hectors of land in Karnali district have been encroached upon that now falls in Tibet’s Furang area.
Similarly, around six hectares of Nepali land in Sanjen River and Jambhu Khola of Rasuwa, have also fallen into Kerung in southern Tibet.
China has also encroached more than 10 hectares of land in Sindhupalchowk district’s Bhotekoshi and Kharanekhola areas those are now under Nyalam area of Tibet, the report said.
In Sankhuwasabha, nine hectors of land have been encroached due to the road expansion in the autonomous region of Tibet where areas around Kamukhola, Arun River and Sumjung River now has fallen into Tingisyan County area.
With this, the survey data further divulged that some places near the Arun Khola, Kamu Khola and Sumjung now also fallen into Tibet’s Tingisyan area.
According to the ministry’s data, Nepal would lose several hundred hectares of land.
The survey was released following a tense situation between India and Nepal over a new map showing Kalapani in Uttarakhand.
However, after a strong objection by the Nepali government, the Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday said that the new political map released by India after bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir accurately depicts its sovereign territory and did not revise its boundary with Nepal in any manner.
Responding to a question on the same, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said that the boundary delineation with Nepal is ongoing under the existing mechanism and New Delhi is committed to finding a solution on the matter through dialogue in the spirit of the close and friendly bilateral relations between the two countries.
“Our map accurately depicts the sovereign territory of India. The new map has, in no manner, revised our boundary with Nepal. The boundary delineation exercise with Nepal is ongoing under the existing mechanism. We reiterate our commitment to find a solution through dialogue in the spirit of our close and friendly bilateral relation,” he said.

Nepal on Wednesday objected to a new map released by India that places the disputed area of Kalapani within Delhi’s borders, saying it was “clear” the territory belonged to Kathmandu.
On Saturday, India released the new map following its decision to split the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two administrative territories.
On the map, India’s border cuts into Kalapani — long a source of contention between the two countries, particularly because Indian troops have been deployed in the area for more than 50 years.
Nepal “is committed to protecting its international border,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
“Any border-related issue relating to the two friendly countries needs to be resolved through diplomatic channels on the basis of historical documents and evidence.”
“The Nepal government will not accept any unilateral decision,” it added.
An 1816 treaty established Nepal’s western boundary with India along the Kali River, but border disputes have arisen over a discrepancy between the two sides over where the source of the river is located.
Rajan Bhattarai, the foreign relations advisor to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, said a solution would be sought through talks.
“We have to verify the authenticity of the map and examine the borderline from our concerned authorities and experts. Then we will start talks using our diplomatic channels,” Bhattarai told AFP.

http://english.lokaantar.com/current_affairs/pakistan-embassy-organizes-talk-programme-jammu-kashmir-dispute-recent-developments/," 

Kathmandu, 31 October (2019) – Pakistan Embassy on Thursday organized a talk programme on “Jammu Kashmir Dispute and Recent Developments” to commemorate the Kashmir Black Day.
The two-hour long programme was attended by about hundred and fifty intellectuals, writers and analysts as well as representatives of human rights organizations.
Ambassador Mazhar Javed recounted the historical perspective of the dispute and the Kashmiris’ struggle for their right of self determination which had been promised to them under several UN Security Council resolutions.
The Ambassador highlighted the human rights violations taking place in Indian Occupied Kashmir after Indian Government’s illegal decision to revoke Article 370 on August 5, which Ambassador Javed said, violated the UN resolutions. The people of Jammu Kashmir have been subjected to inhuman curfew, thousands of arbitrary detentions mostly of teenagers, nights raids, rape, torture and clampdown on internet and cell phone.
Speaking at the event, Dr. Surendra KC expressed serious concern on the media / information blockade, use of pellet guns and arrest of Kashmiri leadership. India has come under serious criticism by UN High Commissioner on Human Rights and other international human rights organizations for its repressive measures in the disputed territory.
It was noted at the talk programme that holding of the UN Security Council meeting in August to discuss the Jammu Kashmir dispute had conclusively negated the Indian propaganda that Kashmir was its internal issue. Kashmir dispute was an international dispute which needed to be resolved according to UN Security Council Resolutions.
Talk by speakers was followed by an interactive session. Two documentaries, one on the genesis of the dispute and the other on international reactions to ongoing human rights violations in Indian Occupied Kashmir were screened.
Unresolved status of Jammu and Kashmir dispute has posed the biggest challenge to peace in South Asia, ever since the two countries came into being in 1947 and the UN Security Council passed several resolutions for resolving the dispute in accordance with the wishes of the people of Jammu Kashmir.
 
Message by The Prime Minister of Pakistan on Kashmir Black Day 27th OCTOBER, 2019
 
The Kashmir Black Day being observed in Pakistan and across the world today is distinct from the past. On 27 October 1947, India had illegally occupied Jammu & Kashmir, and, on 5 August 2019, it took further steps to unilaterally alter the disputed status of the territory and change its demographic structure and identity. Pakistan, the Kashmiris and the Muslim Ummah, have categorically rejected this travesty of law and justice.
Since 5 August 2019, the scale and intensity of the Indian government’s human rights violations have increased several-folds. Through the deployment of additional troops and an unprecedented media and communications blackout, that has continued for almost three months, Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IOJ&K) has been turned into the largest prison on the planet. There is a shortage of medicines and essential food items. Thousands have been arbitrarily detained. Thousands of young boys have been abducted, incarcerated in undisclosed locations, and subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment. The Indian state-terrorism has turned even more atrocious.
The world community, international human rights organizations and the international media are calling India out on this tyranny. The façade of India being the so-called ‘largest democracy’ stands fully exposed.
Pakistan demands the immediate lifting of the curfew and communications blackout as well as rescinding of India’s illegal and unilateral actions. We urge the international community to play its role in ensuring respect for the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the Kashmiri people and averting grave risks to peace and security posed by India’s irresponsible actions.
We express our unshakable solidarity with the people of occupied Jammu & Kashmir and assure our Kashmiri brothers and sisters that Pakistan will always be shoulder-to-shoulder with them. Pakistan will continue its full moral, political and diplomatic support until the Kashmiri people realize their legitimate right to self-determination in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the applicable UN Security Council resolutions.
 
 
Message by the President of Pakistan on Kashmir Black Day – 27th October, 2019
27th October marks one of the darkest chapters in the history of Jammu & Kashmir. On this day, seventy-two years ago, Indian security forces landed in Srinagar to occupy, oppress and terrorize the innocent people of Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IOJ&K) in blatant violation of international law and morality.
The United Nations Security Council through several of its resolutions has upheld the fundamental right of the Kashmiri people to decide their own future through a fair and impartial plebiscite held under the UN auspices. Reneging on its repeated commitments to the international community to implement these resolutions, India has continued on the path of brutal suppression of the Kashmiri people to this day.
Since 5 August 2019 India has imposed an inhuman lockdown over 8 million people in IOJ&K Use of torture, enforced disappearances and restrictions on freedom of movement and assembly are the stark realities today. Indian Occupation forces are perpetrating unspeakable crimes against the Kashmiri people, including women and children, with complete impunity. The indefensible curfew and communications blackout, going on for nearly three months now, is illustrative of the state-terrorism that India has wreaked on innocent Kashmiris for decades. No matter how brutal its policies and tactics, India cannot crush the spirit of the Kashmiri people.
Today, we pay homage to the martyrs for the cause of Kashmir and honour all those who have suffered at the hands of Indian occupying forces. Pakistan reaffirms its unflinching moral, political and diplomatic support to the people of Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir with the solemn pledge that this will continue until the realization of their legitimate right to self-determination.

A Nepali climber has reached the summit of the world’s 14 highest mountains in just over six months, setting a record for a feat that took other climbers years to complete.
The climber, Nirmal Purja, 36, completed his goal early Tuesday morning when he reached the top of Shishapangma in Tibet along with a Sherpa team.
“Mission Achieved!” was the simple message he relayed in a post on social media.
 

“MISSION ACHIEVED !” says @nimsdai from the summit of #Shishapangma #14peaks7months #History
At 8:58 hrs local time, Nims and his team reached the summit of Shisha Pangma. Team Members includes: Mingma David Sherpa, Galjen Sherpa and Gesman Tamang.#BremontProjectPossible pic.twitter.com/PeYUVQ7RnL

“It has been a grueling but humbling six months, and I hope to have proven that anything is possible with some determination, self-belief and positivity,” Mr. Purja said in a statement.
A spokesman for Seven Summit Treks, a Nepal-based company that helped organize some of Mr. Purja’s expeditions, said by phone that it was in touch with his climbing team and confirmed that he had reached the top of Shishapangma.
The attempt to be the fastest to reach the top of all the world’s known mountains over 8,000 meters, or about 26,350 feet, which Mr. Purja called Project Possible, started in April, when he scaled Annapurna. He then quickly tackled the 13 remaining mountains, all of which are in the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges that stretch across China, India, Nepal and Pakistan.
Climbing the world’s 8,000ers, as they are known, requires time in the so-called death zone, an altitude at which reduced oxygen levels make it difficult for humans to breathe effectively and where climbers can die.
The previous speed record for scaling all 14 peaks was held by Kim Chang-ho of South Korea, who completed his climbs in seven years, 10 months and six days. He narrowly broke an earlier record held by Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland, who took seven years, 11 months and 14 days.
Mr. Kim later died in a storm on the Mount Gurja in Nepal, and Mr. Kukuczka died in 1989 while trying to scale the south face of Lhotse in Nepal.
A member of Mr. Purja’s team said she was still awaiting news of a safe descent, and said he would be out of contact for several hours while he made his way back down the mountain.
Mr. Purja drew worldwide attention to his attempt in May, when he posted a photo of a traffic jam of climbers near the summit of Mount Everest.
Mr. Purja managed to reach the top of Everest — a climb he has made several times — but it was an exceptionally deadly season on the world’s tallest peak, with 11 people dying during the window of several weeks with favorable conditions for climbing. At the time, he spoke from Everest base camp about the risks associated with climbing at such high altitudes.
“The mountains draw people, always have and always will,” he said in a message. “Everest is the highest mountain and has the highest draw. You can’t blame climbers for wanting to summit. You can’t blame guides for leading them.”
He said an exceptionally short climbing window also limited the days that climbers could make a final push to the summit.
But he noted that some people were taking unnecessary risks and said that the number of permits, expeditions, guides and climbers needed to be better regulated.
“The most important thing is safety — every person on the mountain, not just your own,” Mr. Purja said.
The government of Nepal is planning new restrictions on permits to climb Mount Everest in an effort to limit traffic on the mountain. Mr. Purja took part in four unplanned rescues during his attempt at the 14 climbs.
He said the idea to try to break the 14-summit record came to him in 2017 when he achieved three speed records on peaks above 8,000 meters.
That year, Mr. Purja achieved the fastest consecutive climbs of Everest, Lhotse and Makalu, in a total of five days; the fastest time from the summit of Everest to the summit of Lhotse, in 10 hours 15 minutes; and he was the first person to reach the summit of Everest twice, Lhotse once and Makalu once in a single push, taking a total of 17 days.
“On completion of these I felt tired, but not completely drained,” he said. “This got me thinking about my physiology and what I could achieve if I really pushed myself.”
High-altitude mountaineering can be expensive, with costs for equipment and guides costing tens of thousands of dollars. Mr. Purja said he had found it difficult early on to obtain sponsorship for his attempt, but eventually the luxury British watchmaker Bremont financed his efforts.
Nick English, a co-founder of the watch brand, offered his “huge congratulations” to Mr. Purja on Tuesday.
“I don’t think we will see it again in our lifetime,” Mr. English wrote in a post on social media.
Mr. Purja credits his endurance to his natural physiology and to his intense military training. He had served in the British armed forces for 16 years before leaving to attempt the record, including 10 years in the special forces. He was a member of the Brigade of Gurkhas — a unit made up of Nepali citizens that has been part of the British military for more than 200 years.
“I looked at the logistical problems that climbing all these peaks posed and worked out they can be achieved in one season,” he said in an earlier message. “Many people have the physiology but I believe my experiences as a member of the U.K. special forces unit — the Special Boat Service — gives me an unequaled edge.”

Kathmandu 14 October (2019) – Chinese President Xi Jinping’s just-concluded visit to Nepal will boost the friendship between the two neighboring countries and elevate bilateral relations, Nepali scholar Yubaraj Sangroula told Xinhua Sunday.
Sangroula, a professor with the Purbanchal University, also expected the visit to bring more opportunities for the economic and social development in Nepal.
“Nepal and China are good neighbors and friends,” he said. “We have been good friends and we will remain good friends.”
Xi’s visit would open a new chapter for the two countries’ relations, he said, adding “his visit is a prelude to development in the next 20 years.”
Sangroula, who is the former attorney general of Nepal, now chairs the Kathmandu School of Law and has researched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
He said that since Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation within the BRI framework in 2017, bilateral cooperation in trade, investment, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges has been deepened at a fast pace.
Achievements of the cooperation could be seen everywhere, he noted, from made-in-China products used by Nepalis in their daily life, to the jobs created thanks to Chinese investments, to the agriculture, telecom and infrastructure construction sectors using Chinese technology.
More people are learning Chinese now, including himself, Sangroula said. “Nepal could really benefit from China’s development.”
China and Nepal agreed on Saturday to upgrade their relations to a strategic partnership of cooperation featuring ever-lasting friendship for development and prosperity.
Sangroula believed that Xi’s visit could deepen Nepal’s participation in the BRI, bring opportunities to his country and boost its development.
Though being a small country, Nepal “contains immensely bigger natural resources,” he said.
The trans-Himalayan connectivity network, a gigantic infrastructure program undertaken by the two countries, could help upgrade the roads, railway system and aviation in Nepal, and better logistics would then benefit the agriculture and industry sectors, improve economic structure and boost export, he told Xinhua.
“Developing the China-Nepal economic corridor is considered immensely vital for transforming Nepal into an economically developed nation and dependable neighbour,” said the professor, adding that Nepal could be a bridge between China and South Asia for regional development.
Talking about the BRI, he said: “it is the most precious gift given by China to the world,” suggesting that the Nepali government put forward more plans to seize the opportunities that the BRI generates for rapid development.
“Nepal’s future is bright if the Nepalese people stand together and work for their prosperity by taking advantage of China’s mammoth economic development,” he said.

Kathmandu, 13 October (2019) – Chinese President Xi Jinping’s trip to India and Nepal has injected new impetus into China’s relations with the two countries, built new platform for good-neighborliness in South Asia, and opened up new prospects for regional practical cooperation, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday.
Xi returned to Beijing on Sunday evening after his second informal meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the southern Indian city of Chennai and a state visit to Nepal.
Enhancing China-India strategic mutual trust
During Xi’s stay in India, the Chinese president had a long and in-depth exchange of views with Modi, Wang said, adding that the two leaders recollected the history of China and India fighting side by side for national independence and liberation, and pioneering the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and envisioned the future of the two countries jointly realizing their respective national dreams.
Xi said both China and India, as two populous countries, the two largest developing countries and important representatives of emerging economies, are at a critical stage of national development and national rejuvenation, with huge potential and broad space for cooperation, according to Wang.
Xi added that China-India relations have transcended the bilateral scope and bear important and far-reaching strategic significance.
China and India should be good neighbors who live in harmony and work together as good partners, Xi said, noting that realizing a scenario where the dragon and the elephant dance together is the only correct choice for the two countries, which serves the fundamental interests of both countries and peoples, and works for world peace and prosperity.
Wang said the two leaders have charted out targets and directions for strengthening practical cooperation between China and India.
They have agreed to establish a high-level economic and trade dialogue mechanism, enhance alignment of the two countries’ economic development strategies, seek to build a partnership in manufacturing industry, and promote balanced and sustainable growth of bilateral trade.
The two leaders also agreed to expand “China-India Plus” cooperation, push forward facilitation of regional inter-connectivity, and work with other related parties to strike the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement as early as possible, Wang said.
China and India have agreed to strengthen coordination within the framework of multilateral mechanisms including the Group of 20, the BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the China-Russia-India cooperation, and safeguard an international system with the United Nations as its core and an international order based on international law, Wang said, adding that the two countries vowed to uphold multilateralism and maintain multilateral trading system.
Xi also called on the two countries to conduct broader and deeper cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and jointly advocate and push forward dialogue and exchanges among different civilizations, so as to continue to create new glory for Asian civilizations, Wang said.
The two countries have agreed to designate 2020 as the China-India year of cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and hold 70 events next year to mark the 70th anniversary of the China-India diplomatic relations.
Deepening traditional China-Nepal friendship
Over the past more than half a century since the establishment of China-Nepal diplomatic ties, the two countries have respected, trusted and supported each other, serving as an example for countries with different sizes to live in harmony, said Wang, adding that Nepal is an important partner of China in the joint construction of the Belt and Road in South Asia.
In the first state visit to Nepal by a Chinese head of state in 23 years, Xi and the leaders of Nepal jointly planned for the future development of bilateral relations, and witnessed the signing of 20 cooperation documents concerning various areas of the national interest and people’s livelihood, Wang said.
Bilateral relations between the two countries have also been lifted to a new height, said Wang, noting that China and Nepal have agreed to upgrade their relations to a strategic partnership of cooperation featuring ever-lasting friendship for development and prosperity.
Such a new positioning helps chart the course for the future development of bilateral relations, Wang said.
The Nepali side said they stand firm in upholding the one-China policy and will never allow any force to use its territory for separatist activities against China. No matter how external circumstances change, Nepal’s friendly policy toward China will remain unchanged.
Connectivity construction between the two sides has made new progress, Wang said.
Leaders of the two countries have agreed to align the China-Nepal co-construction of the Belt and Road with Nepal’s national development strategy of building itself a land-linked country.
Wang said that the two countries will accelerate the building of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network through connectivity projects including ports, highways, railways, aviation and communications, and have announced the launch of a feasibility study of the China-Nepal cross-border railway.
The good-neighborly and friendly cooperation between the two countries has also yielded new results, Wang said.
Xi said the two sides will build an all-around cooperation pattern, enhancing their cooperation in four areas of trade and investment, post-earthquake reconstruction, energy and tourism, according to Wang.
China has pledged to continue supporting Nepal in the country’s post-earthquake reconstruction, and provide support and assistance for the improvement of local people’s livelihood, Wang said, adding that the two sides have also agreed to expand exchanges and cooperation in such fields as education and youth, and at local levels.
Maintaining regional peace, stability
Wang said the recent strained India-Pakistan relations and unrest in the region have drawn grave concerns from the international community.
He said both India and Pakistan are friendly neighbors of China, and the Chinese side hopes that the two countries can properly manage and control differences and improve their ties.
Prior to Xi’s trip to South Asia, the Chinese president listened to the views and propositions of the Pakistani side in his meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan.
In Chennai, Xi said all sides should work together to promote regional peace and stability, and achieve common development and prosperity.
Wang said China is willing to develop and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation with all South Asian countries, adding that China’s respective relations with India, Pakistan and other South Asian countries could run in parallel and develop together, neither targeting any third party nor being influenced by a third party.
During Xi’s visit, leaders of India and Nepal once again extended warm congratulations to Xi on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, expressing their admiration for the remarkable achievements China has made in the past seven decades.
Leaders of both countries said China’s development sets an example of self-reliance for developing countries, and creates significant opportunities for the two countries, South Asia and the world to achieve peace and prosperity, adding that China’s development is unstoppable.

http://english.lokaantar.com/governance/supreme-court-issues-directive-order-ensure-voting-rights-nepali-migrant-workers/,"
Kathmandu, 21 March (2018) – The Supreme Court of Nepal on Wednesday issued a directive order in the name of Office of Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) and other ministries concerned including Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Election Commission regarding the External Voting Rights of Nepalese Migrant Workers.
The Public Interest Litigation was filed before the Supreme Court demanding legal mechanism to ensure the “External voting or out of country voting” apparatuses to ensure the voting rights of Nepali migrant workers abroad. The application sought that the underlining right of ‘opportunity to vote’ of migrant workers as an inherent right falling within the ambit of right to vote and freedom of expression hence, creating an opportunity to take part in election through out of country mechanisms.
The bench of Justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Purushottam Bhandari issued the directive order.
Law and Policy Forum for Social Justice (LAPSOJ) filed the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) at the apex court on 27 April 2017. Considering the significance of the case, the show cause notice on the case was issued by the court on 4 May 2017 and the case was placed under priority hearing.
Today during the main hearing Advocates Hari Phuyal, Barun Ghimire, Anurag Devkota, Alok Pokharel and Kedar Dahal argued before the Supreme Court on behalf of the applicant organization.
Over 4 million Nepali voters are said to be living in 110 different countries. The exponential rise in foreign labour migration has produced a snowball effect on the economy of the nation. However, the government has largely failed to follow up on the implementation of its own laws and policies.
Thus, the most important decision on migrants’ welfare has also been the most discarded. The directive order issued by the Supreme Court of Nepal would serve as a well-timed opportunity for the Nepalese workers abroad to take part in the Public affairs of their country and choose their representatives who will voice and vouch for their rights and access to justice in the future discourse.

Dr Rajesh Bahuguna is currently Dean of Faculty of Law at Uttaranchal University, Dehradun, India. Considered an authority on Constitutional Law and Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) in India, he is subject expert at Uttrakhand Public Service Commission, Uttrakhand and different universities across India. His research articles have been published in leading international journals. Jivesh Jha for Lokaantar caught up with Dr Bahuguna this week to discuss about the statute. Excerpts:
The preamble of the Constitution acknowledges People’s War and a decade-long Maoist insurgency. How do you find this arrangement? Do you think it’s better to give priority to political movements than recognising established socio-legal principles?
The People’s war or Maoist insurgency has been acknowledged by the framers of the Nepali Constitution as they strongly believe that the ideals championed by these political movements gave birth to the new Constitution. It has a stamp of deep deliberation and reflects the declaration of people’s faith and belief in certain fundamentals of national life, a standard from which the state cannot depart anymore. It would serve as a guide to constitutional interpretation for the coming generations. Also, it would serve as a lamppost for enforcement authorities, judiciary or political class to adopt a logical discourse whenever they feel stuck at a point. In yet another sense, preamble serves the cause of the Himalayan state as it succeeds to accelerate the Victorian identity of Nepalis who are globally identified for their “martial race” having inherent quality of toughness, bravery, durableness and discipline. So, I find nothing wrong in it.
Nepal Constitution takes population and geography both into account while demarcating electoral constituencies. Do you think it’s a rational arrangement? 
Nepal Constitution has unfolded a new beginning by taking population and geography both into consideration as the basis for representation while delineating constituencies. It will ensure that the ratio of geography, population and number of representatives to be elected is in one way or the other equal across all constituencies without any distinctions. In a country like Nepal which has highly diverse geography and unequal development patterns, it’s unreasonable to take population the sole criteria for parliamentary seat allocation. The voice and concerns of smaller districts should be equally heeded in polity. Only people with myopic vision would criticise this welcome provision. I would suggest India to adopt the similar arrangement. This is the unique feature of Nepali Constitution.
Nepali charter has been criticised for its citizenship provision. A person is eligible to acquire citizenship by descent when it’s proved that ‘his/her father and mother both are citizens of Nepal.’ However, on non-fulfilment of this clause, meaning where a person whose ‘father or mother’ is a Nepali, s/he is entitled to get citizenship by naturalisation and naturalised citizens are barred from holding vital government offices. Isn’t it a discriminatory provision? 
Look, the citizenship provision, unlike constituency delineation, appears discriminatory. The population of a country can be divided into citizens and aliens and there is nothing in between. Once a person becomes a Nepali citizen, then s/he should not be discriminated against. The state should not discriminate between citizens. Once somebody becomes a Nepali citizen the state should not suspect their loyalty. It will never serve the cause of Nepal. Rather it could fuel tensions in society. It could render people stateless and could also become a cause of conflict. Along with this, the provision violates Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) convention as well. The Constitution seems to show that naturalised citizens are inferior to that of descent citizens and this is unreasonable. There ought not to be any kind of discrimination between citizens just because of their birth in particular families.

Nepali charter reserves 33 percent of positions for women in Nepal’s legislative spectrum. Do you think it will play a significant role in empowering women? 
Reservation itself is a form of discrimination but when it comes to women’s reservation I feel it is positive discrimination which ought to be promoted. This Constitutional provision would certainly increase the participation of women in politics and public life. It may just be a single step but is nevertheless a step ahead in the right direction. Now what remains is for these laws to be implemented in letter and spirit. It’s a welcome provision. However, there should be a limit on reservation.
Would you clarify these limitations? 
See, this mechanism has two dimensions. First, it plays a crucial role in mainstreaming the weaker section of society. Secondly, although reservation is important the society should avoid getting habituated to it. If reservation is continued for generations exclusively on the basis of caste, it will defeat the very object of the policy. Ultimately the professional standard would lose real quality which would help sluggishness prevail. Protective discrimination (i.e., reservation) should work as a support, not a lifelong crutch.
Caste-based reservations have proved fatal in India. At times, it is seen that richer [i.e. creamy layer] sections (who actually don’t need reservation) gain success through reservation quota. It has done great damage to the rest and ensured that actual people who deserve reservation remain as miserable and poor as they were before. Earlier, reservations were proposed to stay in place for a conditional period of 15 years only, but continuing it forever has certainly helped vested interests to grow and it has already divided the Indian population artificially along the lines of caste and creed to a great extent.
I would like to borrow the words of Justice Markandeya Katju who has recently made a significant remark: Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has appealed to the well off to give up subsidised cooking gas but the irony is that he is yet to appeal the richer sections of society to give up the benefits of reservation so that the poor and the needy could benefit the most. Why has PM Modi not dared to call for giving up of caste-based reservation?
It’s unfortunate that caste-based reservation and politics has become a tool to cash vote bank in India. The caste-based reservation leads to creation of a mindset in a section of society that anyone is entitled to certain benefits just because one is born in a particular caste. People have started claiming reservation as an inherent right. I would suggest Nepal to refrain from enacting any law that would ensure caste-based reservation.
Do you think provisions relating to judicial appointments are healthy?
The charter offers government of the day a say in entire appointment process which is unfortunate. The judiciary under political clout would obviously fail to administer fair and reasonable justice.
The Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal must not waste time exploring alternatives when the answer exists in Constitutional framework itself and need of the hour is to consolidate efforts and focus energies on implementing laws in both letter and spirit.
This is the seventh Constitutional document in Nepal. Given some conflicting provisions, do you think that this Constitution will sustain?   
There is a qualitative difference between the repealed Constitutions and the 2015 Constitution. Previous Constitutions were crafted by monarchs but this has been enacted by elected representatives in Constituent Assembly. This is a positive difference and a reason to celebrate. So, I believe that the Nepalis, especially people in Southern plains, should not be disappointed with a handful number of conflicting provisions. Legislature and judiciary both should play an active role in bringing reformation which would ultimately turn fruitful for the nation. Then, the Nepali Constitution would also become a broad-based document, leaving the conflicting provisions far behind.
The Constituent Assembly (CA) gave birth to the new Constitution on September 20, 2015 with an aim to upright the newborn republic on a strong pitch of pluralism and representative socio-economic-political democracy and to establish Nepal as an ideal state in Asia.
Nepal has adopted a Constitution (which is enacted by the Constituent Assembly for the first time) and like all other Constitutions in the world this too will mature and evolve. So, there is no reason to be disappointed with certain provisions. They can be amended. Judiciary should play an active role in spearheading the cause of people. In India, judiciary has helped democracy flourish despite repeated failures of other organs. Nepal’s higher judicature could play an instrumental role in cementing walls of fundamental rights and knocking down all the boundaries resting upon discrimination, bias, prejudice or undemocratic principles.
What should state do to ensure a wider ownership of Constitution? 
It is truism that law alone can never rid society of conflicts linked to systematic discrimination, oppression or poverty. The Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal must not waste time exploring alternatives when the answer exists in Constitutional framework itself and need of the hour is to consolidate efforts and focus energies on implementing laws in both letter and spirit. Mere enactment is not going to serve the cause of nation. The future of Constitution depends on how agitating groups are included in the mainstream by offering required amendments. Every Constitution has scope of amendment to ensure its wider ownership. Interestingly, Constitution of Nepal is flexible in terms of amendment as it provides that two-third majority can amend any provision except sovereignty and integrity. The success of the Constitution will also depend on how the state handles legitimate concerns of the national population as well as international players.

Kathmandu, 26 December (2019) – Umesh Sah, 40, of Rajbiraj Municipality in eastern Nepal has expressed dissatisfaction at his arrest.
Speaking at the press meet organised by Metropolitan Police Range on Thursday, Sah said that the police had arrested him for no reason.
He said, “I don’t know why we have been brought here. Why have you arbitrarily arrested us? The media has published our name for no reason.”
The police had arrested Sah in Saptari district and brought him to Kathmandu. During the press meet he requested the reporters to stop photographing him but they did not comply.
“What is the charge against me?” he asked.
The police asked him to keep silence. He then said, “I too am a mediaperson. Can the police arrest me just because my name was in the contact list on the cellphone?”
Pleading his innocence he said that the police had trapped him. He said lividly, “I should be allowed to put my side of the story.”

“Prove if I am a criminal,” he said after taking off his mask.
The police kept quiet all the time while Sah alleged them of arresting him without any reason. They took him to the holding cell shortly after the press meet.
The police had arranged the press meet to make public the persons alleged to be involved in human trafficking. A young woman was taken to Biratnagar to carry out Tantric ritual involving human sacrifice. The police has made public seven people including Sah alleging them of human trafficking.
Acting on the report filed at the Metropolitan Police Range by the young lady originally hailing from Dhading district, five policemen under the command of the Inspector were deployed from Kathmandu to Saptari district.
The police arrested Krishna Tamang of Kawasoti Hapsekot-1 Nawalparasi district, Umesh Sah of Rajbiraj Municiplaity-14 Saptari district, Dil Kumari Budha Magar of Ghorahi Municipality Dang district, Umesh Majhi of Saptakoshi Municipality-11 Saptari district, Dilip Poddar of Biratnagar Metropolitan City-8 Morang district, Prema Tamang of Khaniyabas Rural Municiplaity-2 Dhading district and Ranjit Kumar Chaudhary of Gadhi Rural Municipality-1 Sunsari district and brought them to Kathmandu.
The police said in the press meet that one shaman in a temple in Bihar, India had asked Dilip Poddar to find a woman to be sacrificed in the temple. The shaman had pledged to pay huge money to Poddar and even provided some advance payment to bring the woman.
According to the police, the accused group was taking the woman to Bihar for human sacrifice in pretext of making a documentary.

Kathmandu, 29 December (2019) – Over the last few years, Nepal has turned into a “transit country” for drug trafficking.
Dinesh Amatya, DIGP, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), acknowledges that drug traffickers have made Nepal a transit point.
Speaking with the reporters last Sunday DIG Amatya said, “Expensive narcotics including cocaine are not used in Nepal. It is taken to foreign countries via Nepal.”
Last Wednesday the police arrested four foreign nationals with six kilograms of narcotics. These foreigners seem to have made Nepal a transit country.
Investigation by the NCB has shown that Alina Aldosaina, 18, and Pawel Vasileu of Belarus had come to Nepal to acquire cocaine on 18 December.
Brazilian Robert Carlos, 43, and Indian Rahul Jambrana, 54, had come to Nepal on 14 December from Brazil via Ethiopia and Delhi. They met Aldosaina and Vasileu at Lost Garden Hotel in Lazimpat, Kathmandu.
DIGP Amatya said that these vendors made a plan to traffic Cocaine to Hong Kong by putting it inside the false bottom of their jackets.
A special team of the bureau arrested Aldosaina and Vasileu at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) on Saturday while Carlos and Jambrana were arrested at Lost Garden Hotel based on the tip by Aldosaina.
On 17 January, Narcotics Control Bureau had arrested a Bolivian national Herera Artega Olga with three kilograms of cocaine at the TIA. He was hiding cocaine inside the false bottom of his jacket and had come to Nepal on a Fly Dubai flight.
Before that on 11 November the Bureau had arrested Brazilian national Sergio Turswaga with two kilograms of cocaine at the TIA. He had come here from Sao Paulo, Brazil via Doha, Qatar.
Nepal, thus, has become a transit point for drug peddlers. Because of lax laws and unrestricted movement in the airport, drug traffickers have been abusing Nepal’s international airport, said Basanta Lama, SSP and Spokesperson at NCB.
“Drug traffickers have been using countries that have abolished the death penalty as transit countries. They prefer Nepal because they will not face capital punishment even if they are caught,” DIG Amatya said.
Cocaine is hugely produced in South Africa. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico also produce cocaine. There is no demand for cocaine in Nepal.
SSP Lama said that the investigation has shown European countries, the US, Japan, China and other developed countries with high demand of cocaine.
“Drug trafficking is high in Nepal but the traffickers have been unsuccessful because of the Nepal Police action,” SSP Lama said.
Shailesh Thapa Chhetri, DIG and Spokesperson of the Nepal Police, said that NCB of the Nepal Police has been working with the international community to stop drug trafficking.

Europe has a lot on its plate now.
Fear spreads as an increasing amount of new cases of the COVID-19 are being confirmed in more European countries; to add more oil on the fire, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that he is opening its border to Syrian refugees.
It’s not like the economy is going great now. For the last quarter of 2019, the eurozone grew at only 0.1 percent, the slowest rate since early 2013. And the bottom line seems yet to come as disruptions to supply chains induced by the coronavirus continue to pose threats to the EU economy.
This is a major test for EU leadership, one that might further shape EU politics and identities like the refugee crisis and Brexit.
The free movement of people and goods is at the core of a collective EU identity. But this consensus has been repeatedly challenged by the refugee crisis in 2015, when migrants were regarded as low skilled people who were only “stealing” jobs while enjoying better social benefits.
It was during the crisis some EU member countries introduced border check measures to control the flow of migrants. Even now, six countries – Germany, France, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway – have maintained those checks.
While the refugee issue still hanging in the air, the coronavirus outbreak seems to provide nationalists and right-wing parties with ammunition to make more fuss about the border issue.
French far-right politician Marine Le Pen is calling for “control of our borders.” Austria’s far-right interior minister Herbert Kickl questioned the parliament on Thursday, asking “How long have you known that the coronavirus was on the march towards Europe and therefore also Austria?” The language gives the audience a quick flashback to three years ago when populists linked crime and illness to migrants. And this time, it is the virus that prepares to “march” towards Europe.
EU experts have warned that closing borders could be “ineffective” and even counterproductive, as potential patients could go unchecked and continue to spread the virus. There has been the discussion to suspend the Schengen Agreement temporarily. But the European Union has refused the possibility.
If closing borders is not an option, then the EU has to come up with a much more effective system that would prevent the COVID-19 from further spreading. In only one week, confirmed coronavirus infections have surpassed 1,000 in Italy.
Although the discussion of border control is once more on the table, the current “virus crisis” is not like the refugee issue in that the latter is much more complicated tangled with economic, geopolitical and historical elements. Europe was forced to confront its colonial past, and its response was a wake-up call to many how the “borderless” ideal has its dark side. It is almost a dead knot that requires a more fundamental structural change inside EU and cooperation with Middle Eastern countries and America.
The current outbreak is an external challenge which would make it easier to play the victim card, but this would be more inexcusable if not handled well. As it is a direct test to the EU bureaucracy, it all boils down how officials can act swiftly and effectively.

Each country has its own responsibility to take action in the healthcare area to combat the virus. But it is up to the EU to make sure these efforts are coordinated, and information on the disease is shared. It also has the duty to provide advice to countries that still have open borders on how they should act on a national level.
And there’s also a question on the economy. The current outbreak has taken a heavy toll on northern Italy, Lombardy and Veneto. Both are wealthy areas whose economic output almost accounts for one-third of Italy’s GDP and 40 percent of the country’s exports. The financial system of the EU also urgently needs to be prepared for disruptions on economic activities and supply chains, against an already sluggish economy.
The EU will come through the outbreak with a much stronger or weaker collective identity, and it is all about leadership and actions.

The current Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) debate in Nepal to approve MCC grant by parliament is the talk of the town. There are several narrations building by noted intellectuals against and for MCC — From the fabric conspiracy theories like the US will build its military stations including a missile system in Nepal or the country is being sold to the US for just $500 million. Pro-MCC supporters are claiming that, it is the largest amount ever granted to Nepal by the US and avoiding this grant could be accidental.
Underlining the MCC compact agreement; few articles are interesting to observe. For example, MCC compact agreement has 2 major objectives. The first objective stressed the MCC role to facilitate power trade and increase electricity consumption in Nepal whereas the second objective stressed, improving road quality across the strategic road network. Here, both objectives are “open” and underneath shows interest in working in overall Nepal’s jurisdiction.
But, the MCC project has already prescribed project sites. So, technically its objective and working area won’t tally with each other. As India is the greatest potential buyer of Nepal’s electricity; this agreement shows American involvement in Nepal’s power trading with India. The proposed transmission line seems on the way where China had showed interest in rail network. The word “Strategic” road network in Nepal is always related to India & China. Whether it is Biratnagar- Kimathanka, Kerung-Kathmandu-Pokhara-Lumbini or Raxaul-Kathmandu—All these road network involves geopolitics. If putting MCC on this affairs; there may involvement of the US along with India & China in Nepal’s affairs.
Way forward
Agreements like MCC is a representative character; which will become normal in coming days in Nepal. It is always hard to disaggregate development assistance likely free of geopolitical elements for the country like Nepal. Even UK PM is planning to merge DFID to Foreign Office of UK for the purpose to make it more UK vested interest driven. In MCC also, the US vested interest is clearly seen. But it is normal in global politics. The one who donates see their national interest first. This is even precarious at a time when the US has openly mentioned that, China, Russia & North Korea are its core enemy in its June 2019 Pentagon’s report leading to the massive Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) expansion by the US. In counter, Chinese Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) is coming to play.
Great Power competition in Nepal appears in the forms of ‘soft and sugary’ coating like assistance. The current world order is the product of the WWII victors. With advancements of the tech boom & globalization; Western centrism is now countered by several Asian tigers. This is now a phase of transition– whether to accept great power shift or to resist it. BRI was initially targeted for infrastructure building but after IPS expansion; BRI has changed its course and aiming for resisting IPS.
Both IPS & BRI are “playing a jazz” in Nepal’s political field. Nepal is $30 billion economy and China’s $14 trillion economy and the US’s $21 trillion economy can easily lure Nepal. That is why, both power centers have started bottom to up diplomatic exercise influencing everyone from public to intellectuals and to the political leaders. Both power centers have streamlined their public diplomacy aiming to be popular in Nepali public by celebrating as ‘Nepaliway’ and Twitter diplomacy. Shall we have to receive the foreign development cooperation or not? The answers can be debatable. Nepal had even received development aid during Cold War when both the US & the then Soviet Union has heightened rivalries. So, we need to have ‘Better Converging Vision’ to make this development cooperation able to fulfill our national interest and development gaps. In addition to this, Nepali experts and political leaders should have open and frank conversation with the US representatives to make MCC cooperation working for both. Such types of bilateral cooperation requires win-win approach not a zero sum game.
In conclusion, how to survive in this great power rivalries? The solution can be many more. But for now (but not limited to) and analyzing the current situation; we need to transform Nepal’s Foreign Ministry to be the most powerful institution in Nepal. This reformed Foreign Ministry will oversee Nepal’s foreign affairs without any influence of politics or change of government. This will draft “Coping Strategy” to cope against geopolitical thunder strikes in Nepal by great powers. Nepal has survived till now not due to any other factors( like Military or Economic) but because of our great rulers and leader’s (Prithvi Narayan Shah, Bahadur Shah, Jung Bahadur Rana, Chandra Shamsher, Late King Mahendra and B.P Koirala) intellect and wisdom including policy undertaken by them. So, reforming Nepal’s Foreign Ministry as the powerful institution could able to draft a coping strategy to survive us in these great power competitions ultimately helping us to converge all development cooperation to fulfill our national interest & development needs.

The United States may not have expected the criticism it received for the grant aid, in the form of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) pact, that is in the process to be passed by the parliament of Nepal. However, the Nepali parliament is dominated by the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), and its members have had a strong anti-capitalist education.
“If the MCC will be passed in Nepal, the Communist Party will cease to exist because the U.S. will never tolerate the word ‘Communist,’” remarked a Communist leader in a private conversation with a low depressed voice.
There is mutual hatred between the United States and the international communist movement. Communist cadres look at the dependency theory and assume that the United States is the root of all evil. They also assume that Washington will not hesitate to exploit smaller, “periphery” countries. Nepal, a land-locked country in the Himalayas, is one such state.
Nepal’s government maintains a strong leftist ideology, but the leadership in the NCP are more “realist” than they are communist. In the past, Nepal’s communists did not hesitate to ally themselves with the monarchist party, with the two opposite poles of the political spectrum allying themselves for the sake of electoral success. But unlike a temporary alliance at election time, passing the MCC will have a lasting impact. This is problematic for cadres who continue to believe in communist philosophy.
Nepal’s Communist Party has lacked stability both in terms of its foreign policies as well as its institutional unity, two trends that continue to this day. In one major example of the nexus between internal disunity and foreign policy, Bam Dev, a prominent communist leader, split the party in 1998 over a dispute stemming from the Party’s voting in favor of the Mahakali Treaty in the parliament. To Dev, the treaty discussing water-sharing with India was assumed to be an unequal treaty.
The Nepal Communist Party was established in Calcutta, India on September 15, 1949, and since then the Communist Party has had a love-hate relationship with India. The Maoist faction that declared a civil war against the kingdom of Nepal has long articulated a strong anti-Indian narrative, raising the issue of national sovereignty. However, it was suspected at the time of civil war that the Communist leaders actually lived in India and were supported by the Indian government. This became evident to the public when the former editor-in-chief of the largest Nepali newspaper, Sudhir Sharma, wrote his book Prayogshala about the role on India in the Maoist insurgency after the conflict had been resolved.
Nepali Communists at one point benefitted by holding a strong pro-Moscow stance. The Soviet Union, after all, would provide scholarships as per the recommendation of the Nepal Communist Party. But international politics dramatically changed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Nepal was not immune. As a result, Nepali Communists started to compromise to match present-day realities, including by experimenting with their relationship with other international actors.
Relations between India with the Nepalese Communist have been nothing less than turbulent. The first Communist prime minister of Republican Nepal, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, more commonly known as Prachanda, in 2008 went to China instead of India, which was not well received by the Indian media. In 2010, leaked audio purportedly showed Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara promising that “a friend in China was ready to give money” to bribe 50 MPs to support Prachanda in the prime minister’s election.
Prachanda, a former Maoist leader who is now the co-chair of the NCP, has a history of being against the United States, which he views as an imperialist power. Just last year, Prachanda issued a statement supporting the Maduro government in Venezuela against the U.S.-backed acting President Juan Guaido. This was followed by the press release of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal rejecting that stance. Prime Minister K.P. Oli (and the other co-chair of the Nepal Communist Party) dismissed Prachanda’s remarks as a “slip of the tongue.”
The Maduro case was not an isolated example of disagreement in the top ranks of the NCP on foreign policy stances. In 2019 China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Prachanda had agreed Nepal will not be a part of U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy. If that remained the case, Nepal would not be able to receive a grant of $500 million through the Millennium Challenge Corporation. But Oli seems to be committed to ratify the MCC agreement in the parliament.
It is clear that the NCP is deeply divided when it comes to international relations. It is an open question as to how the Communists in Nepal will define themselves while they grow closer to the United States and if the United States will maintain close ties with a group that uses the word “Communist” to identify themselves. Doubts are emerging as to whether the Communist Party might split once again due to their contradictory beliefs or if they have finally learned from the mistakes of splitting up into multiple factions, which allowed other parties to win elections amid a divided vote.

Nepal is a tiny Himalayan nation situated between two Asian giants: China and India. The geo-strategic location of Nepal is very sensitive to China and India currently than in the past. The upcoming superpower China is leading the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project to drive her political and economic influence in the worldwide arena. The US, India, Australia and Japan are leading the Indo-Pacific strategic scheme to counter the Chinese BRI project.
BRI is a large scale project which will put the Asian region in the leading role through development and new idea of trade. Nepal is a BRI member. But Nepal is not a member in the Indo-Pacific project. In fact, it is impossible for Nepal to be a part of Indo-Pacific strategy either directly or indirectly in the near future.
The BRI is the biggest project of China to bring the power back into the hands of China. BRI is the signatory initiative dream of president Xi Jinping to flourish the Chinese model in the global surrounding and challenged the US international leadership while it came out.
The biggest reshuffling in the international system is the rise of China. While the Indo-Pacific Strategy advocates on the American alliance in terms of connectivity issue of land, ocean, and energy and cyber security, the reality is to restore the American policy and trace the China policy and their outlook in the international surrounding.
This is the right time for Nepal to seriously accelerate nation’s priorities. In the current situation, China has been closely monitoring Nepal’s foreign policy, political developments, situation, economic fluctuation and security policy by the perspective of BRI framework. Similarly, America and its allies also look at Nepali policies by the perspective of Indo-Pacific framework and its important geopolitical situation.
The involvement in BRI and Indo-Pacific Strategy is the major concerning agenda of Nepal’s current foreign policy and diplomacy.BRI is far more accepted by all political parties and civil society. But there is crucial debate and confusions about MCC projects in Nepal.
Around 65 countries and 40 international organizations have so far signed agreements with China under the BRI. The Chinese government has already started multi-billion-dollar connectivity projects under the BRI in different countries. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is one example. BRI provides enormous opportunities for the least developed countries to scale up their infrastructure stock and address the supply-side constraints to trade. This can supplement LDCs’ efforts towards graduating to the status of developing country and also support meeting the internationally agreed development goals (IADGs) including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
However, LDCs need to be cautious regarding the sustainability of debts and the commercial viability of the projects financed by such debts during project selection and planning. They should also be robust in their diplomatic efforts to negotiate their interests while making any deal under the BRI. LDCs also need to address their bottlenecks, including the problems of political instability, corruption and lack of absorptive capacity, to largely benefit from this China-led global initiative.

The BRI diversifies Nepal in terms of trade, connectivity (rail, road, transmission, and telecommunication) and access to the sea port. BRI as the mega project to link the whole world, appears as a beam of hope for the Nepali people. After releasing BRI concept the number of Chinese tourists raising each year in Nepal. This is the best time that Nepal should link their connectivity and economic empowerment link with the BRI. It makes a better relationship and correlation build up with upcoming superpower China. Nepal’s signing up to the BRI only means a framework agreement, which officials from both the countries know needs to be taken forward to get projects under the initiative rolling.
Although there has not been much progress in finalizing projects under China’s BRI, the growing clash between the United States and China in Nepal is palpable. But the big question is, will Nepal be able to strike a balance America, China and India, the big three major powers?  This question will create more challenge in future than present. In present, Nepal needs huge resources to meet its aspirations of peace, development and prosperity. Despite efforts made by government, Nepal is failing to attract foreign investment and its development goals are under pressure. In balancing other country’s desires for military cooperation, Nepal has made it clear that it is ready for bilateral military drill with friendly countries, but it is not ready for regional military grouping.
The indo- Pacific Strategy was devised in 2006/07 to address the priorities brought about China’s emerging economic and military power. Amid consensus opinion about the eastward shift of economic gravity following the rise of China and India as global economic superpowers, the US has also readjusted its strategic focus on Asia and the Pacific region.
At last, MCC and BRI, there is yet another difficulty in setting Nepal’s foreign policy on the right track. On the base of public information Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Corridor agreement with China and what the potential sources of financing are scant at best. Analysts and national media are left on their own to speculate about the corridor, the specific projects, costs, and timelines involved. Any reservations, doubts and clarification on the MCC Nepal Compacted and IPS, Nepalese party should seek clarification and modification as required through negotiations and consultations with respective counterparts of MCC and IPS. In this part, Nepal government should unite all stakeholders and make a single national priority.

For all its natural attributes, Nepal is considered a country that provides a template for what not to do, ecologically.
Officials from neighbouring states will quietly admit to looking at Nepal in horror, as a country that has blithely sacrificed its environment in favour of rampant overdevelopment and tourism-led economic gains – and yet is still mired in poverty.
The latest example of this is the current consternation over plans for a new international airport for Nepal. Currently, Nepal has just one international airport in Kathmandu, and two other – albeit much smaller – international airports under construction.
Proponents claim that the cost-benefit analysis comes up in favour of the airport: that all factors considered, the boost to the economy outweighs the environmental impact.
But the Nepalese government is pushing ahead with ambitious plans for a major international hub that would rival Heathrow in terms of space and have the capacity to handle as many as 60 million passengers each year. The Nijgadh International Airport, which was first mooted 24 years ago, would be situated around 130 kilometres from Kathmandu in the southern Bara region that borders India’s Bihar state.
Nijgadh is planned to have two runways, cover more than 8000 hectares, and be able to accommodate the A380 superjumbo jet, making it the largest airport in South Asia. A highway would also be built connecting the airport to the capital, shortening the road distance between the two points to 72 kilometres and bringing the drive time down from five hours to just one.
On the face of it, it appears a reasonable plan. Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan Airport is operating almost at capacity, with around 7 million passengers passing through each year. It also sits precariously at an altitude of 1338 metres above sea level, in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley, which is surrounded by hills – a difficult approach for even experienced pilots to navigate. Plans for the new facility came after two major crashes in 1992 claimed nearly 300 lives at Tribhuvan.
As with any major project, the Nijgadh airport is expected to create as many as 100,000 airport jobs and thousands more to build the highway. Its location close to the Indian border means it would service nearby regions of India, gaining the project the approval ­– and, possibly, the financial help – of the Indian government. Officials also say that the airport would use air routes that would reduce the flying distance between Europe and West Asia, and would mean that passengers travelling between these points could get a birds-eye view of Mount Everest. Zurich Airport has been shortlisted as the potential developer and is expected to deliver a proposal early next month. The cost of the entire project is US$3.45 billion, and will be delivered under a public-private-partnership arrangement.
The Nepalese government is said to have picked the location for the new airport based on factors including topography, runway orientation, and overall accessibility, as well as the relatively low cost of land, which would make land acquisition more streamlined. The high-speed highway to Kathmandu would mean a smooth commute of around an hour: currently, the capital’s notorious traffic snarls mean it can take as long as two hours to get into the city from the Tribhuvan. Tribhuvan is aged and inefficient, and a source of great frustration for Nepal’s growing aspirational and outward-looking population.
At the same time, the government has launched its Visit Nepal 2020 campaign, seeking to boost tourist numbers from 2019’s 1.17 million to 2 million this year. Marching ahead with the Nijgadh project fits perfectly into the narrative that, five years after suffering a devastating earthquake, Nepal is back open for tourist business.
So a much-needed second international airport sounds like a no-brainer, right?
There’s just the pesky matter of trees. And wildlife. And oxygen. And floods.
Based on a 2018 government-initiated environmental impact assessment, it has been revealed that 2.4 million trees will have to be cut down to make way for the facility. They are mostly sal trees, and while the Nepalese government has vowed to afforest to offset whatever is felled, it isn’t clear just what they will replant.
The site also abuts the Parsa National Park, which is home to elephants, tigers, rhinos, leopards, bison, deer, and 490 bird species. The proposed airport site, currently Nijgadh Forest, is part of an 800-kilometre green belt that stretches across the Indian border and takes in some of the most prominent Indian tiger parks. This forms a vital wildlife corridor for migratory species, and would potentially disrupt their access to lakes and rivers. Nepal is a signatory to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity.
Environmentalists also say the project could lead to less oxygen in the atmosphere and dry up water resources in surrounding areas and cause massive flooding downstream. The site is close to a number of rivers, and there are fears that the construction could lead to flooding, and the airport itself would be prone to waterlogging, should there be sustained rains.
Opponents are calling on the government to change the site or to reduce the overall proposed area of the airport.
Proponents, however, claim that the cost-benefit analysis comes up in favour of the airport: that all factors considered, the boost to the economy outweighs the environmental impact, and that Nepal would still have more than 40% forest cover. (By comparison, neighbouring Bhutan is 71% forested, more than the constitutionally mandated 60%.)
For now, however, the tree felling is in legal limbo after the Supreme Court in December issued an interim order to halt tree-clearing activities in the Nijgadh Forest, after hearing lawyers for environmentalists claiming that the true figure of trees lost will be closer to 90 million trees. But the government has indicated that it will continue with other construction work, and the project will proceed. It’s a sign that there’s little impetus to overhaul Nepal’s dire regional reputation on environmental issues anytime soon.

Nepal’s public scene is boiling up with debate over the controversial Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) pact, which many see as infringing Nepali sovereignty. The controversy ignited as some Maoist leaders in closed-door meetings claimed that the MCC is the real reason for the ouster of former speaker of the house Krishna Bahadur Mahara. Mahara, who was just acquitted of charges of attempted rape, had not given space for the ratification of the MCC in the legislature.
The agreement indeed holds many asymmetric qualities. According to section 7.1, the MCC agreement “will prevail over the domestic laws of Nepal,” while section 5.1 (iii) mentions that MCC funding cannot be used to violate U.S. law “or United States Government policy.” But the real controversy is not about the agreement’s asymmetric nature, but the Nepali phobia that the U.S. aid is part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy and may be used for military purposes.
There have been some fake viral stories about the United States preparing its army to enter Nepal the day MCC is ratified by the parliament. The United States may use dominating language, but Washington generally openly projects its desired plans. As an example of U.S. transparency, the annual Foreign Military Training Report not only mentions the location of all U.S. military training in Nepal but also the course title, the student unit, U.S. unit, total cost, start date, and end date.
The MCC agreement, in section 2.7, clearly mentions that the funding cannot be used for the military but some readers look at section 6.8, which provides immunity for MCC staff in “all courts and tribunals of Nepal,” and fear this could be used for military purposes. There is no doubt that diplomats should continue to hold diplomatic immunity, but should immunity be granted for other activities? Isn’t this an infringement of the sovereignty of Nepal?
The United States is not generally circumspect. It has made a clear statement that the MCC is part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. Many in Nepal thus perceive the MCC agreement as a violation of the Constitution of Nepal’s Article 51 (m), which commits the country to a strong non-alignment principle.
In particular, there are fears that the MCC agreement will drag Nepal into the U.S. competition with China. The United States’ June 1, 2019, Indo-Pacific Strategy Report very clearly mentions that China is a revisionist power and a threat, while Nepal maintains friendly relations with China. The Nepali mentality was deeply shattered with the unofficial Indian blockade of 2015. Kathmandu realizes the importance of roads and railways connecting to China and thus holds the Belt and Road Initiative in a positive light.
The United States was the second country recognized by Nepal, after the United Kingdom and even before Nepal recognized its neighbors, India and China. Since then, the two countries have held a very friendly attitude toward one another. The United States assigned special importance to Nepal after the emergence of the People’s Republic of China.
A key strategic location of Nepal, the Mustang district, was used by the CIA to support the Khampa rebellion in Tibet. This fact could not have been kept hidden from the eyes of the then-government of Nepal, as the rebel group had used their military might to rape, loot, and vandalize Nepali property. Nepal finally disarmed the Khampa rebellion after pressure from China in 1974; prior to that, the rebels had been present in Nepal in some form since the early 1960s.
It is very clear that in return for its assistance, the United States made every effort to keep the Nepali monarchy happy. Washington extended a grand welcome to the King of Nepal when he visited the United States in 1967. Tellingly, this was not the case in 1983 when another king of Nepal went to the United States — perhaps because Nepal no longer provided a base for the Khampa rebellion.
During the same period, the United States was a benevolent donor for the Nepali army as it provided $1.8 million in military aid in 1965-66. During this time, Nepal enjoyed military equipment that was not even available in India.
Nepal, being a major contributor to United Nations Peacekeeping missions, continues to maintain strong ties with the United States through participation in the Enhanced International Peace Keeping Capabilities (EPIC) program.
It is a false rumor that the United States plans to misdirect funds and resources from the MCC to pursue its security interests in Nepal. The United States is not a shy country and tends to openly display its militaristic agenda and ambitions. But it is also true that the MCC acts as an unequal treaty that puts American law above Nepali law and even forbids Nepali law to prevail when a punishable offense is conducted under the aegis of the MCC.
There is no doubt the United States under Donald Trump does not value diplomatic etiquette. The MCC has been presented more like a regular business deal, which becomes unacceptable for the Nepali people. Nepal after the 2015 unofficial blockade by India does not want to distance itself from China. The United States seems not to understand the complexities affecting Nepali public opinion, which may turn the Nepali people against the United States.

“Australia is an observer of SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation], which brings our two countries to work within a framework of regional cooperation as well,” said Nepal’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali on Saturday to mark 60th year of diplomatic relations with Australia.
Other observer countries and regions to this organization of South Asian countries include China, the US, Japan, South Korea and the European Union.
Gyawali’s latest reference to SAARC is an indicator of Nepal’s continued commitment to that body, which has virtually remained dormant since Kathmandu hosted the 18th summit in November 2014. Shortly before it ended, participants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka announced their next biannual meeting would be hosted by Pakistan in November 2016. They had unanimously agreed on the date and venue of the 19th summit that was to include India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Persuaded by Nepal’s prime minister at the time, Sushil Koirala, Modi and Sharif publicly shook hands to assure the region, and the world at large, that they would work together for the region’s well-being. In other words, bilateral differences or acrimony would not impede the process that was initiated in 1985 for the region that is home to 1.7 billion people.
Pakistan was chosen as the country to host the mega event of 2016 because the SAARC charter requires the host of the next meeting is chosen by alphabetical order. Subsequently, that gave Pakistan time to make preparations for the upcoming summit. However, new disputes pertaining to border skirmishes in the Kashmir area angered India, which pulled out of the scheduled summit just weeks before it was to take place in Islamabad. Sensing New Delhi’s uneasiness, some other member-states declared that they too would pull out from the planned event. Meanwhile, Pakistani diplomat, Amjad Hussain B. Sial, assumed the office of SAARC Secretary General at the secretariat located in Kathmandu. It was unlikely to enthuse India.
As founding member and the current chair, Nepal views that the ongoing stalemate as a temporary phenomenon: once the current phase of hostilities subsides, as they have in past, India and Pakistan will recall their public pledge to work for the betterment of the entire South Asian region. Nepal’s incumbent prime minister, Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, appears optimistic in his belief, and commitment to regional cooperation. The most recent occasion was on February 7 when he visited the SAARC secretariat. “It [SAARC] represents hope of over 1.7 billion people of this region for accelerated economic growth, social progress and cultural development,” Oli said during his visit which attracted extensive media coverage.
In 2018, Nepal hosted leaders of the countries belonging to the group called the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC). This group, launched in 1997, includes five SAARC members and two countries from Southeast Asia: Myanmar and Thailand. Two other SAARC members, Afghanistan and Pakistan, are not members of BIMSTEC, which is why India attaches considerable importance to this entity. Indian leaders and leading diplomats have made public pronouncements aimed at ultimately developing BIMSTEC as a security alliance of member-states. But Nepal has declined to be drawn into the plan as country’s constitution requires it to remain non-aligned to any security alliance or military bloc.
Nepal also believes that BIMSTEC cannot be an alternative to SAARC. The geographical area, historical perspectives, demography and cultural dimensions the SAARC cover a far wider area and are much more relevant to the region. Myanmar and Thailand are already in another Asian body, ASEAN. In the early 1980s, president Ziaur Rahaman of Bangladesh and King Birendra of Nepal articulated their vision to form a South Asian group of seven countries. Initially, Afghanistan was not among them. Its application for membership was approved only in 2005, during the Dhaka summit. It formally joined SAARC in April 2007.
The Dhaka summit is also remembered for its acceptance of China as an observer. Nepal’s King Gyanendra proposed giving China observer status despite opposition from some quarters. Afghanistan’s full membership was proposed by India as a counter move, although Nepal was not enthusiastic about this idea in view of the continued presence of American troops there.

Janakpurdham, 19 February (2020) – An unprecedented event occurred on Tuesday in Sabaila Municipality-2 in Dhanusha district in Province-2.
Four weeping women were carrying their father’s dead body. Their mother was at the front and five sisters trailed her to the cremation grounds.
Other villagers were in the back side. The funeral procession walked for five kilometres.
Every eye witnessing the funeral procession was full of tears.
Breaking the tradition of not allowing women to carry the corpse, the sisters were carrying their father’s dead body.
Ram Narayan Yadav, 65, died on Tuesday. Yadav is survived by his wife and five daughters. Nepur Yadav, Raj Devi Yadav, Pramila Devi Yadav, Anita Devi Yadav and Gorki Yadav carried their father’s dead body. The body was taken to Kamala Ghat which is five kilometres east from the village.
Rabiya Devi Yadav, 62, is the deceased Yadav’s wife and she cremated her husband’s body.
“I didn’t have a son and raised all my daughters without any discrimination,” Rabiya Devi told Lokantar. “That is why I decided that all my daughters will carry their father’s body.”
Eldest daughter Nepur Devi Yadav said that she felt that she was equally entitled like a son when she carried her father’s body. “I feel that I have been able to change the society’s perception that only sons should carry their father or mother’s body and cremate them.”
Yadav was an active member of Nepali Congress party. Central Member of the Congress Party and Former Minister Anand Prasad Dhungana went to pay his last tributes to Yadav.
He said, “The society needs to change. Daughters carrying their father’s body to the cremation ground is a welcome change.” Dhungana bolstered the spirit of the bereaved family with this statement.
Leaders and active members of Nepali Congress party accepted the suggestion of the daughters to shoulder the father’s body. Villagers did not protest this move.
Local resident Jagat Sundar Sah said, “The villagers easily accepted daughters shouldering their father’s body and wife cremating the body. Villagers are praising them for his unprecedented move.”
Local people say that women carrying dead body to cremation grounds is rare.

‎Doha (Qatar), 25 February (2020) – Qatar Airways is making temporary hold and schedule adjustments to its operations to South Korea and Iran until further notice due to significant operational challenges caused by entry restrictions imposed by certain countries. An ongoing review of operations will be conducted regularly with the intention to reinstate flights as soon as the restrictions are lifted.
With travel restrictions on recent visitors to these countries, the airline is in a logistically challenging position to schedule crew on certain routes, limiting its ability to maintain scheduled operations elsewhere. As a result, the airline will temporarily readjust its services to South Korea and Iran from 26 February.
Flights to and from South Korea to Doha are temporarily adjusted to operate with a smaller aircraft. An Airbus A350-900 will replace a Boeing 777-300 to meet demand while only passengers with onward connections through Hamad International Airport are accepted for travel from Incheon Airport. For Iran, Qatar Airways’ scheduled passenger frequencies will be on temporary hold, effective from 26 February 2020, for an evaluation period of two weeks up to 14 March 2020.
This will affect flights to and from Mashhad, Shiraz and Isfahan. Frequencies to and from Tehran will temporarily move from 20 weekly frequencies to seven weekly. Adjustments to the schedule of flights to and from Iran will take effect from 26th Feb 07:00 am Doha time. Qatar Airways’ all-cargo operations will not be affected by this temporary hold.

http://english.lokaantar.com/world/deputy-prime-minister-minister-foreign-affairs-renews-qatars-call-create-binding-security-agreement-middle-eastern-countries/,"
Brussels, 19 February  (2020) – Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani reiterated Qatar’s call to all countries in the Middle East to conclude a binding security agreement, specifying the conditions for its success to be “collective and binding; based on agreed principles of security, developed with rules of governance, dispute resolution, and accountability; respectful of sovereignty and equality among its members; a commitment to non-interference in internal affairs.”
In a speech before the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs on Wednesday, the Foreign Minister underlined that any broad security collective agreement must bring together all countries in the region to be effective in achieving peace.
The Minister said, “In my region, our primary challenge is establishing peace and stability, which will be restored only when all the countries in the Middle East agree to work together to reach consensus on key challenges. This is critical to all of us here today because the current turmoil, transnational terrorism, and displaced populations directly impact you here in Europe.”
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs considered that security in the Middle East is closely linked to international peace and security, adding “We need the EU’s diplomatic support getting every Middle East country to the table, enforcing international law, and restoring the world order to keep nations accountable.”
His Excellency affirmed, “Qatar will continue to play a role in de-escalating tensions in the Middle East because Qatar believes in the power of dialogue and commitment.”
The Foreign Minister noted, “Recently, we witnessed a breakthrough in the US-Taliban peace talks, which have been hosted in Doha for years. This breakthrough serves as a step to Afghan peace, and hopeful proof that a commitment to negotiation can – create – results.” He added, “We appreciate all the efforts by the European Union to contribute to peace and security in my region.”
Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani stated, “Qatar is a small state in a turbulent neighborhood, and yet we are ranked one of the safest countries in the world. Globally, we are counted-on to facilitate dialogue between East and West.”
He noted, “Qatar has been implementing progressive domestic policies for decades. Qatar created a legacy of education, media, travel, and sports.”
His Excellency added, “We built the Qatari education system from the ground up, and now host many Western universities in Doha, where women outpace men in higher education.”
The Foreign Minister stated, “Qatar launched the Al Jazeera Network to deliver uncensored information to my region,” adding “Year after year, Qatar Airways ranks among the most elite airlines in the world.”
His Excellency said, “I invite you all to join us in 2022 as we deliver the first World Cup in the Arab world, which will be a much-needed injection of hope for the youth of my region.”
HE the Minister said, “Qatar considers the youth of the Middle East to be its most important development goal. Desperate out-of-school children, and out-of-work young people often fall prey to dangerous ideologies,” adding, “So outside Qatar, and in partnership with European Union member-states, we have put over 11 million out-of-school children back in primary schools, and are creating job opportunities for 5 million young people.”
The Foreign Minister underscored, “In Qatar, we share common values and priorities with the EU in promoting peace, security, and prosperity in both our regions.”
“We believe that the world is interconnected, and so successes and failures in the Middle East affect the EU, just as your successes and failures affect us.”
He stressed, “This interconnectedness requires continual collaboration and comprehensive multilateral solutions.”
Answering questions from the attendees, HE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani expressed Qatar’s appreciation for the efforts of HH the Amir of the State of Kuwait to reach a solution for the Gulf crisis, adding we were hoping for reaching an understanding with Saudi Arabia last November when the talks started, but the talks were suspended two months later by the Saudis without prior notice.
His Excellency added we still welcome any efforts by Kuwaiti mediation, and we hope that Saudi Arabia or any of the blockading countries will come to the negotiating table to reach a solution to this crisis.
He said that Qatar understands that the loser of this crisis is the entire region, and that there will be no winner. He added we will all be winners if we can solve it in a way that avoids conflicts in the future.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said that the important thing that should happen in the Gulf and we hope it will happen is that the Saudis and the Emiratis will return to their senses and stop the campaigns against Qatar.

On the relations between Doha and Tehran, His Excellency said that Iran is our neighbor and it has many problems with the United States. Qatar has good relations with Iran, which has opened its airspace and ports to supply goods, and we appreciate that, especially in the early days of the blockade.

Now we would like to see our region stable and we do not want to see a conflict between Iran and the United States, the latter being our strategic ally and Qatar is hosting its largest military base in the region. Qatar has also neighborly relations with Iran.

The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs said we worked hard when the crisis escalated between Iran and the US, and we urged them to resort to negotiations, contain the situation and solve the crisis between them diplomatically. We all hope for a solution.

Responding to a question about the existence of a law targeting freedom of expression in Qatar, HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said we are still strong defenders of freedom of expression in Qatar and we are also defending it outside Qatar. Unfortunately this law has been misinterpreted. This law targets misleading information not freedom of expression. Misleading information occurs everywhere and is not exclusive to Qatar.

As evidence that it does not target criticism, this law has been criticized in Qatar and no one has been brought to trial or judicial accountability under that law, His Excellency said, adding that it is only to protect our country from misleading information and propaganda campaigns that started with this blockade against Qatar.

On Libya, His Excellency said that Qatar’s position has remained consistent and is in support of the Skhirat Agreement signed in 2015, which resulted in the formation of a legitimate government recognized by the international community, adding that we will continue our contacts with the UN-recognized Government of National Accord. We condemn all military actions taking place in Libya by retired General Haftar, and we condemn his targeting of the capital Tripoli.

We have travelled the world and asked for an end to this aggression, support for the ceasefire in Libya and help the parties reach a political solution. We see that the international community has started taking action a month after this continuous attack on Tripoli. We are watching that there is a party that does not abide by the United Nations resolution and international agreements signed in this regard, such as the Berlin Agreement and the Moscow Agreement.

He pointed out that Haftar bombed the port of Tripoli yesterday, and before that he attacked the airport and all civilian facilities but we have not seen any strong action taken against him.

His Excellency said that the Libyans should sit at the dialogue table to decide their fate themselves without any external interference, adding we will support that, including the Berlin Agreement, as long as it leads to stability in
Libya.

Regarding the Palestinian cause, HE the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs said Qatar is one of the biggest supporters of the Palestinians and contributes to that either individually or through programs implemented with various United Nations agencies, noting that Qatar is now the largest donor to UNRWA to fill the gap occurred after the United States withdrew its support for UNRWA, stressing that the role of UNRWA is still important and that the right of these refugees to return to their country must not be forgotten.

The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs pointed to other programs in Gaza and the West Bank, such as building schools, hospitals, roads, housing projects and supplying them with energy, especially in the Gaza Strip. He added that the period of electrical supply has been increased from two hours to eight hours per day since a year and a half. We will continue to support the people of Gaza.

Asked about the US President Donald Trump’s plan for peace in the Middle East, HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said we welcome every initiative that develops a plan to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but it must be in accordance with international legitimacy, and this is Qatar’s position. We urge the two parties, through the United States, to enter into direct negotiations, and we would like to see peace between them, but we must also not ignore the fact that the Arab countries agreed to an Arab initiative that they presented and that initiative constitutes a fair basis for such negotiations.

His Excellency added we will continue to advise the parties to engage in negotiations and we urge the United States to speak directly with the Palestinians to better understand and improve their plans.

Responding to a question about Qatar’s role in Syria and whether it financed terrorist groups, HE the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed that Qatar had never funded terrorist organizations in Syria, stressing we have made this clear from the beginning and we have said that our support goes directly to the Syrian people either through humanitarian support or humanitarian organizations alongside the United Nations to provide them with development assistance and educational services. There are more than a million children in the Syrian refugee camps who are receiving education through Qatari programs, and we will continue this path, he said.

As for supporting the Syrian opposition at some point, he said that was a collective effort by the Group of Friends of the Syrian People, and we did so publicly with others, as these contributions were distributed equally among those countries. We are sure that our contributions did not go to any terrorist or extremist organization, and we condemn such actions. These terrorists in Syria are trying to steal the revolution of the Syrian people, and we will continue to support the Syrian people until the elimination of terrorism there. The Syrian regime has been killing his people for years and the international community, unfortunately, failed to save Syrian people, he said.

Regarding Qatar’s role in the Sahel region and its position vis-a-vis extremist groups there, His Excellency said we are against any role of these groups and we condemn all their activities.

He pointed out that Qatar condemned all terrorist acts, whether in the Sahel region or all over the world through official statements. He added we support directly the Sahel countries to raise their capabilities and Qatar will continue to support the governments of those countries in carrying out reforms by their governments to ensure that they can bring in more stability for their countries.

His Excellency affirmed that Qatar has made great progress in the field of workers’ rights and has undertaken reforms in recent years in partnership with many international organizations such as the International Labor Organization, which now has an office in Qatar, pointing to keenness to ensure the implementation of laws by all operating institutions to reflect the development taking place.

On climate change and carbon neutralization, His Excellency announced that Qatar is now building a solar power plant that is considered one of the largest of its kind in the world, pointing out that the World Cup stadiums will be environmentally friendly.

Nepal on Friday barred climbers from all mountains — including Everest — over the coronavirus pandemic, in a major blow to its tourism industry.
The Himalayan country, which has so far confirmed one coronavirus case, earns 4.4 million dollars a year from climbing permits while the losses to expedition organisers will be even higher.
As well as suspending all climbing permits, Nepal stopped issuing tourist visas on arrival, Yogesh Bhattarai, Minister for Culture Tourism and Civil Aviation told AFP.
“The government has decided to suspend all spring expeditions and scrap permits for the time being. The decision can be reviewed after analysing the global scenario over the coming month,” tourism minister Yogesh Bhattarai told AFP.
Expedition organisers and Nepal tourism professionals said the move, which came a day after China barred access from its side, was justified but would cause a financial disaster.
Nepal, still recovering from a devastating 2015 earthquake, was also hoping to attract two million tourists for the first time in 2020, celebrating it as a visit Nepal year.
US-based Furtenbach Adventures cancelled a move to shift its operations to Nepal after China closed the mountain on Thursday.
“This is disappointing news for both our expedition leaders and our clients who have trained for months for this year’s climb,” expedition organiser Lukas Furtenbach said in a statement.
Every spring a tented city of hundreds of foreign climbers and support staff grows at the foot of Everest and other peaks. All have to live in close quarters.
As the air thins, breathing is already difficult at higher altitude — adding to medical risks if there is an outbreak of any kind among climbers.
“We understand the dire consequences a COVID-19 outbreak at base camp would have. Sadly, we have to agree that this is a responsible call to make right now,” Furtenbach said.
Nepal has issued only five permits for the season but none for Everest so far.
Everest attracts hundreds of mountaineers from all over the world each spring, when a window of good weather opens up between late April and the end of May, prompting a rush for the summit.
Last year’s spring window saw a record 885 people summit Everest, 644 of them from Nepal and 241 from the northern flank in Tibet.
The traffic-clogged season saw 11 deaths on the mountain, with at least four blamed on overcrowding.
– ‘Devastating consequence’-
But the expedition is not cheap. An Everest permit costs $11,000 and the total cost of the climb can be anything between $30,000 and $80,000.
This will be the third time in the last decade that Everest’s summit will remain empty.
Climbers abandoned the mountain after the 2015 earthquake triggered an avalanche which killed 18 people at Everest base camp before the season began.
Only one climber reached the summit in 2014, when an avalanche claimed the lives of 16 Nepali guides on the notorious Khumbu icefall that sits above base camp, forcing organisers to cancel their expeditions.
Santa Bir Lama, president of Nepal’s mountaineering association, said the cancellation will have serious repercussion on the tourism industry of the country.
“It would have a devastating impact on our tourism and economy. The companies will suffer and workers even more. But it is a responsible thing to do considering the risks,” Lama said.
Many guides and support staff depend on the short climbing season for the bulk of their annual earnings.
“It will be very difficult this year. Not only Everest, we might not get work on other mountains either. All of us have families and children to send to school. This is when we earn the most,” said Temba Bhote, a guide on Everest.

http://english.lokaantar.com/articles/legal-cogitation-lockdown/,"Jivesh Jha 

The ultimate end of legislation is the greatest happiness of the greatest number, says distinguished jurist Jeremy Bentham who has pioneered the legal philosophy called “Utilitarian Individualism.” If we endeavour to link this theory with the current approach of the state, we will come to learn how far the governance has succeeded in advancing pleasure and avoiding pain in the life of people in the battle against Covid-19.
Bentham, also a scholar of Analytical School of Jurisprudence, opines that pleasure and pain are the ultimate standards on which a law should be judged. Put it simply, state action that aims to seek pleasure and to shun pain deserves to be justified. The current Coronavirus-lockdown could be studied under the jurisprudence of utilitarian school when one comes to learn that a short-term sacrifice is being made for the long-term good of the society. After all, Bentham too favoured short-term sacrifice for the greater good of the society.
In contrast, this emergency-like situation which is different from financial, national or state emergency could be studied under the lens of John Rawls’s theory of justice as fairness in a sense that that the lockdown has been imposed to ensure that the worst-off, i.e., Covid-19 positive patients, are made well-off after the proper treatment.
Still, human rights activists or critics of the lockdown may construe the power conferred on Chief District Officers to enforce the Infectious Disease Act, 2020 BS (1964) and the incidents of police brutality in southern plains as reflection of John Austin’s approach to implement the laws. Austin, founder of Analytical School of Jurisprudence, defines law as the command of sovereign backed by sanction. In this respect, every positive law has four elements viz., command, sanction, duty and sovereignty. It means, an outlier is bound to feel the burn of sanction.
Ever since the announcement of lockdown, quite a number of videos have become viral on social media, showcasing the incidents of police brutality inflicted on persons found violating lockdown. The violence ranges from vicious Lathi-charge to asking to hold LPG cylinder on the neck while squatting at the street.
It is to be noted that Austin’s definition of law is not earthed on the rocky foundation of morality. He neither favours natural or divine law, nor underscores the need of throwing justice, or good conscience on laws in force through robust judicial activism. He is just concerned with the enforcement of laws. He does not import the contents of morality to judge the folds of laws. So, the police action, irrespective of its brutality, to implement the command of the sovereign, i.e., government at the helm, could be called just in the eyes of Austin.
Despite this, the imposition of Corona-lockdown to maintain social distancing to curtail the outbreak of Covid-19 is much in the nature of Bentham’s hedonic calculus, an algorithm formulated by Bentham for calculating the degree of pleasure and pain. As novel coronavirus has become a global pandemic, it has affected uniformly without any distinction to caste, colour, creed, political ideology or economy. It does not see the richness or poorness of a person while causing infection. The world leaders are struggling to combat this epidemic. Lockdown; social distancing; quarantine; or self-isolation is the only weapon with which we can curtail the outbreak of Covid-19. Though the smell of dictatorship could be found in police action, police staffs have stood as frontline warriors against the deadly coronavirus. It’s a fact which cannot be sent to backburner just because of one or two incidents.

However, the legal regime cannot be a distributor of unhappiness. The government has invoked Infectious Disease Act, 1964 to impose a lockdown to combat the possible outbreak of Covid-19 infection in the country. The Act, 1964, which is home to as many as five Sections that merited enactment during King Mahendra’s regime, envisages that the outliers would be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be more than one month; and/or also liable to fine of Rs 100 (Section 3). The Chief District Officer has been empowered to implement the Act, 1964 (Section 4). The legislation nowhere allows the police to brutally attack the violators of lockdown. The police brutality is sheer violation of rule of law.
So, does rule of law make people happy? If the content of morality, justice, or good conscience flows through the legislations in force, then people living under those laws would be comparatively happier than those whose laws lack these contents. Rule of law is passport to happiness as crime rate is low in a country that sees the uniform application of laws without any discrimination.
Though the Act, 1964 is a just law, its implementation cannot bring happiness unless the daily wagers, underprivileged ones, stranded people or poor and needy citizens meet their basic needs during the period of lockdown. If people undergo the burn of hunger or famine, it would not bring happiness in society. Nor would it help the state to achieve the goals of the legislation. After all, people with low immunity are more prone to the risk of coronavirus. The spirit of law dies at the hand of the complexities of human life.
Above all, we deserve to have governments at the helm to improve access to quality health and education to recognize and respond to pandemics. Government can only act locally against epidemics, unless it gets an opportunity to act beyond its borders. If our concentration is on combating Covid-19, the question that immediately arises is how to respond to the complexities of human life caused due to lockdown. It’s high time to take steps towards building a happier society and ensure maximum happiness for the maximum number of people. A just law and order deserves to uphold Bentham’s philosophy, for a vibrant democracy deserves to form a structure to accelerate happiness and frustrate pain.

Om “A-U-M” is a universal hymn. Our existence revolves around the cosmic ground and it is evolving every day. But if we stay still and focused, we can almost hear a silent hum like vibrating sound in the form of “OM” coming from far corners of the universe itself.
The real form of sound transpires from its echo. The echo of sound has an original and native word which is known as omkar. Om has three syllables. The origin of om is a-u-m. The ‘aah’ from om is found while pronouncing ‘ka’ or ‘kha’ simply, it is found in most of the consonants. Hence, the letter ‘aah’ is also known as Akshar Braham.
The syllable ‘u’ is made up of ‘aah’ and ‘e’ from which ‘uhkar’ is formed. It means omkar also forms from ‘aakar’. ‘Uh’ was generated while pronouncing ‘aah’ so the dynamic form is ‘uh’ of omkar. Om can be found in Vedic references, the four principles of Vedas expound the knowledge of entire creation. All of this knowledge is contained in Rig Veda and the knowledge of Rig Veda is contained in the first syllable “a”. While chanting Om, the vibration starts from navel region and is prolonged all the way to the nose, the vibration created from humming Om is like a divine blessing to the human body. The advantages are innumerable. Some of them are as follows:

It creates a phenomenal difference in the way our body functions, our mind feels relaxed and stable which provides a psychological peace, it reduces stress, cures depression and anxiety.
Chanting “a-u-m” improves our perception, focus and concentration. We feel a positive vibe around us which makes our thinking and speech practical as well as constructive. It improves our work efficiency tremendously and we get more productive.
Our personality becomes more attractive and we find ourselves always happy and satisfied in life. It helps to create a balance in our day to day busy lifestyle, giving us a feeling of tranquility.
We are surrounded with a positive aura which can be felt by others around us.
It is very beneficial from a health point of view; it improves cardiovascular function by balancing the blood pressure in the body so our heart beats in a regular rhythm. It also improves nervous function and digestive health.
It creates a vibration which is felt through the vocal cord and sinuses which clears the airway passage enhancing our respiratory system.

Since we are facing a pandemic and the whole world is in the state of panic and fear due to Covid-19, Om therapy can be very effective to address this situation. In order to create a shield against coronavirus and protect ourselves as well as our family from this deadly virus we should practice Om therapy every morning for 45 minutes and 30 minutes in the evening. Consistency is the key so in order to see the results it should be done every day.
Let’s create a healthy, safe and happy environment for our family along with our community and help chase away this deadly virus Covid-19 from our country.

When the deadly earthquake jolted Nepal in 2015, people in my village did not feel much pain because the jolt did not cause damage to their health. This time when coronavirus is terrorizing the globe, my village is in thrall to its dire consequences.
Coronavirus fear has brought the government on its knees. Five positive cases of Covid-19 in Nepal have been reported with no deaths, fortunately. Nepal is the country of ‘villages’. If the scary Covid-19 reaches the villages, can our rural public healthcare manage it?
The possibility of food scarcity can be predicted in the rural areas if the virus spreads. Reality is that Nepal has been importing rice, lentils, vegetables and almost all the edible commodities from neighboring country India. These days Nepal-India borders are completely locked down. Indian government has taken this lockdown more firmly to avoid corona’s abstract chain because India has dense population.
Villagers like to meet each other at tea stalls. Rural residents do not have a habit of keeping stock of commodities. In Madhesh, barter system still exists but in this panicky situation bartering is almost impossible. There used to be a time when rural lives used to depend on farming. They used to have almost all the basics in their homes but the current situation is totally different. People’s lives depend on markets and imports.
The last decision of central government regarding the lockdown came with more restriction. As per the decision, breaching the norms of lockdown may allow the security enforcement to book someone for six months.
As the rural area holds the least number of literate and educated population, those from educated families have been maintaining self-quarantine but those not familiar with such concept still wander here and there. Small markets in the countryside are still open. Gatherings can easily be seen. School fields are being occupied by local boys playing football and cricket. They are having water from the same hand pipe without washing hands or using sanitizers.
We should accept the reality that locally elected representatives are the guardian of all people within their territory. They have the authority to maintain daily lives of their people. It is their legitimate duty to guarantee social security to the people of their particular constituency.
In my municipality, the elected ward chair is missing from the scene. We have two community schools in our ward. Ward chair could have transformed those schools into temporary quarantine centers. He could have coordinated with vegetable suppliers to arrange short-term market each day in the village to fulfill the need of daily consumption of green vegetables. He could have spread awareness among the people regarding the importance of social distancing and self-isolation to fight against coronavirus. I talked with my relatives and friends residing in different villages. They too experience the same pain and dissatisfaction with their locally elected representatives.
When the federal government announced lockdown and requested people to stay at home to break the chain of deadly corona, rural folk woke up from their complacency. In my village which is in Province-2, few people said that lockdown and directions to fight corona would have come from Mohammad Lal Babu Raut government.
On 29 March, the Province-2 government announced special packages for the needy, including the farmers, daily wage laborers and the deprived. People have raised questions like: are there any standards to define a farmer, total number of farmers and total number of daily wage earners? There are many informal laborers without salaried jobs. How would they respond to a sudden loss of jobs? Will the government assist such informal laborers? Just allocating few chunks of money in the name of fighting coronavirus does not mean that Province-2 government has fulfilled its responsibilities. In every way possible, the provincial and local governments have completely disregarded the large chunk of the population.

As migrant laborers have returned from gulf countries, I believe that there must be many more cases than told but they have just not been identified. I am immensely worried about community transmission. We are just not aware of it because there is not widespread testing.
Mere lockdown may not work. Provincial and local governments must start testing its population whether really the rural population is infected with Covid-19 or not. If found infected, they should be shifted to quarantine centers.
Similarly, strict lockdown measures should be applied to the rural population. As this this is the time of harvesting wheat and lentils, special strategy and packages must be announced for the farmers. Meantime, doctors should be deployed at rural health care centers with generous allowances and attractive insurance packages.

‘Covid-19’ is the scientific name of coronavirus. This name has been given by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020. It was firstly traced in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID It is caused by the virus named as SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, the beginning of 21st century witnessed SARS virus which is related to respiratory disease. What annoys many is that the symptom of this virus is not easy to find out. The early symptoms can be confused with common cold or flu. A person cannot reach to a conclusion that s/he is infected with this virus unless s/he approaches the doctor for its proper confirmation.
The symptoms start with fever, followed by problem in respiratory system, cough, and cold. Globally, the ministry and governments concerned have been declaring the rise in novel coronavirus infections. It is to be noted that the virus is parasitic as compared to bacteria. Comparatively, virus spreads more rapidly than bacteria as the former multiplies with the living cells in the body. Scientists and medical doctors believe that the chain of coronavirus would break down in hot weather but the same cannot be expected in cold weather conditions.
On a positive note, the instruments of the state have been and are adopting all possible measures to prevent the outbreak of this virus. If media report is something to stand by, corona has shown its presence in almost all member states of United Nations.  This way, it has become a global pandemic. Neither developing countries like India and China, nor the developed states like Italy or United States are free from this deadly virus. The graph of the virus is increasing by the day. The officials of WHO and the institutions involved in curtailing the outburst of Covid-19 are frequently suggesting possible measures to prevent and combat coronavirus.
India has witnessed many outbreaks of epidemic diseases in the past. But none of them were as widespread and deadly as coronavirus. Prior to coronavirus’s arrival, India witnessed the grief and pain of H1V1 virus (in 2014-15) which is famously known as swine flu. Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan and Maharashtra were the most affected areas. These states had reported more than 33,000 swine flu cases and nearly 2,000 deaths during 2014-15. Like all other tough times the country has faced, we shall manage to overcome the deadly virus.
So, what causes the infections?  It entered India and her neighboring country Nepal with those who had recently visited foreign countries where pandemic of coronavirus is widespread. Slowly and gradually, the whole region (i.e., South Asia) has been engulfed under this lethal virus.
Although India has experienced national emergency and state emergencies, she was fortunate enough to have no urgent situations.  But this time around we have one more emergency in the list. The makers of the Constitution have envisaged three forms of emergencies: national emergency, state emergency and financial emergency. Perhaps the drafters of the highest law of the land were hopeful that India would succeed to curb infectious diseases and she would not have to undergo through any tough times where the health of people could be compromised. In the aftermath of widespread corona infections, people’s negligent behavior, lack of health hygiene and insensitivity are to be blamed.
Despite this the government has taken considerable steps to overcome this disaster. The state has shown its courage in implementing penal provisions envisioned under criminal laws along with the epidemic Act. These laws have not been invoked to dismantle right to move; right to life and liberty and right to work but to control and abate the outbreak of infectious Covid-19. The motive and intention is to save humans first. After all, it’s the first and foremost duty of the state to protect the humans; we cannot think of human rights unless we have humans.
In his first address, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi administered a 14-hour curfew to break the chain of transmission. In the second address, he has passed the order of nationwide lockdown, except the essential commodities like pharmacy, or groceries. He urged the people to go for self-quarantine or stay home to prevent and combat corona. Yet, different states have passed different orders to initiate fight against this deadly virus. For instance, Uttarakhand administration seeks a written note of apology and/or fine from the outliers of lockdown. In the state of Telangana, police have been empowered to open fire at the persons who intend to roam on the roads for no good reason or violate the lockdown order.
At this backdrop, the medical doctors, nurses and health professionals’ tireless service in treatment of the patients of this deadly virus is highly praiseworthy.
At this backdrop, the medical doctors, nurses and health professionals’ tireless service in treatment of the patients of this deadly virus is highly praiseworthy. They are the first persons who deserve respect and honour from us. Truly, they are following the words of the Hippocratic Oath that they were administered during the award of their medical license.
Moreover, police officials, who are often alleged to be corrupt, are rigorously working for the implementation of lockdown. They are stopping the people roaming on the streets. They are activating punitive measures to tame those who are untamable. This time, the police have proved themselves that they are there to serve the people and pledged to serve country till their last breath.
Fortunately, there are some law abiding citizens as well who are contributing in combating with Covid-19. They are adopting all possible measures that have potential to curb the spread of infections. Prudent persons are following the guidelines issued in the public interest.
Even shopkeepers are assuring social distancing at their place of business. In Puducherry, the customers are advised to stand in the circles, which are made in front of shops at a distance, in a bid to curtail the outbreak of infection of deadly corona. There are NGOs engaged in providing food to people who are far away from their home or who don’t have sufficient means or matter. The government agencies have also come with ambitious plans to provide grocery items at minimum rate. The various state governments are providing free bus service to the daily wagers who are left stranded.

Yet, there are issues to worry about. Prudent persons are concerned with health hygiene and they are observing the health guidelines issued by WHO and government departments. They are playing creative as well as constructive role to curtail the spread of corona.  But at the same time, we have significant number of people who are negligent in observing the guidelines issued to control and abate coronavirus. Their carelessness may further spread the deadly Covid-19.
Like India, Nepal could expedite welfare functions during this deadly epidemic-induced lockdown. The government agencies should provide free lunch and dinner to the daily wagers who are mostly affected with wartime situation created by Covid-19. The people who are left stranded deserve to reach home. State could engage public buses to help the daily wagers arrive their home. The essential services should be provided at a low rate and even free of cost to the poor and needy citizens.
Corona is a global pandemic which cannot be combated unless there is a collective effort. Above all this, Nepal deserves medical and financial support from India to fight against coronavirus.

For years, 54 families of Aali community at Panchadewal Binayak Municipality-5 of Achham District have been leading a tough life because of the acute shortage of water. Majority of the families are Dalit (35), Janajati (12), Chhetri/Karki (7). And the total population is 354.
Although being at the bank of Karnali River, the community had no proper source of water for drinking and irrigation.
In lack of drinking water facility, people were compelled to drink water directly from the Karnali River without any purification risking their lives to diseases and the fear of drowning during flood season.
“It was very tough as we had to walk to the river and bring water on a pot. Forget about irrigation, it was even difficult to ‘ferry’ sufficient water for drinking carrying on my back and head,” says Jayasara Karki, a mother of three.
“We were forced to drink ‘dirty and muddy’ water during rainy season.”
She further added that it was even difficult to send children to fetch water as there were chances of drowning in the flood.

“We all know that Nepal is rich in water resources. And no doubt, these people were also rich in water resources but they could only see it, not utilize it,” says Rajendra Khanal, Programme Manager, Resilient Livelihood and Sustainable Food Security at DCA Nepal.
DCA, through its local partner SOSEC Nepal and with the support from Panchadewal Municipality, Achham, installed Hydraulic Ram Pump Water Lifting technology helped to bring the river water to the village.
And this brought happiness in the faces of these people reeling under acute water shortage for years. The access to sufficient water for drinking and irrigation hasn’t just made lives easier for these people. It also envisaged new opportunities, including employment generation and change in their food habit.
“We now eat fresh green vegetables and sell it in the local market and make money,” says Jayasara.
The earning has also helped Jayasara to become economically strong.
“Until last year, I had to completely rely on my husband’s earning, who is in India working for us,” she says. “Not just school stationery of children, all the food and vegetables were bought with the earning from India.”
“But things have changed now. I now sell vegetables and buy other necessary food for my family. I can now pay for my children’s fees and stationery,” she proudly says.
“We now have plenty of water to use for sanitation, wash hands properly, clean the toilet and bath our children regularly,” she says, “In lack of enough water it was even difficult to keep our toilets clean which resulted into many diarrheal cases in the village. But since we started drinking this water, we haven’t seen any such cases.”
Why don’t you invite your husband back home?
She smiles and says, “I have already invited my husband and let him know about the development of water facility. We can now work together in vegetables farming, earn together and live together.”
Prem Bahadur Majhi, Chairperson of the Kalika Farmers Group, who manages all the agricultural products to the market, was planning to go back to Malaysia looking for job.
“I lived in Malaysia for two years, and was planning to go back again,” he says.
“But as things changed in this village, I changed my mind and started vegetable farming. I now sell potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage and other vegetables and have started a good earning, better than what I was earning in Malaysia.”
He now wants to stay back home, do something here in the country.
“I can now stay with my family,” Majhi, father of one child, says.
Out of 54 families, 27 are doing commercial vegetable farming.
DCA, through its partner SOSEC Nepal, provided trainings for vegetable farming and introduced the villagers with different kinds of vegetables including potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, chili pepper, spinach, carrot, beans, radish and many more.

“The project also taught these villagers to make plastic tunnels and grow organic vegetables utilizing both vertical and horizontal spaces by planting bio-pesticidal property crops such as coriander, garlic, onion and protect from insect/pest infestation” says Khanal.
“Later the communities themselves started making plastic tunnels and growing vegetables.”
Khanal believes that the change in the agricultural pattern has resulted into the ‘eating habits’ that had eventually contributed to the nutritional food access for the children in the area. “Earlier, there were times when we had to feed our child with no vegetables, sometimes salt or chili pepper, but now we have varieties of vegetables,” Jayasara says.
Deputy Mayor of Panchadewal Binayak Municipality, Ambika Chalaune says that it was a great initiative for the benefit of the people of Aali village and a successful implementation.
“We have been successful to bring water in the village with zero energy technology,” she says.
“These people forced to go to Karnali River risking their lives and spending a lot of time for ‘contaminated water’ are now able to drink ‘safe drinking water’ at their doorstep.” The project supported 2.8 million rupees (21,150EURO) and the Panchadewal Binayak Municipality supported 700,000 rupees (5,288 EURO) to make this installation successful.
DCA also provided various other supports as necessities to uplift the living standards of the people living in this village and is planning to develop a prototype village by 2020.

Covid-19 virus is spreading mercilessly and with full acceleration, mocking physical boundaries of the whole world. The US has outnumbered China in infection rate while death toll in Italy and Spain has been the highest.
The endeavour of the so-called developed world seems helpless while facing this micro- organism that cannot even be seen with naked eyes. Each and everyone for years have been so busy with their personal lives that all of a sudden the virus comes as a messenger reminding people of the values and importance of home and family.
Any prediction of the economic effect at the moment seems too early even for the greatest of brains. However, it can easily be argued that this will trigger greater crisis than the Great Recession of 2008. It will affect millions of jobs in the near future, pushing millions into severe poverty and causing further millions to starve.
Millions of vehicles that crossed borders everyday have stopped while thousands of aircrafts that carried millions of passengers from one part of the world to the other in a day have been quarantined inside the airports.
Nearly all the countries that have always preached the values of democracy have locked their citizens down inside their houses. Human rights organizations are experiencing a clueless period of what is and should be human rights at large. The largest democracy in the world, India, has been lathi-charging its citizens to make them stay inside their own houses.
World’s topmost body on health, the World Health Organization, has to keep reminding people to wash their hands which to this author is a shame! People in welfare states like Denmark have been angry at the government since thousands of suspected infected people have no access to testing kits and are locked inside their home with every chance of infecting others. Billions of dollars spent every year on academic studies and lab researches of pathogens, microorganisms and vaccines to combat against the possible outbreak of disease seem to have gone in vain.
The world has possibly been in the largest crisis since the end of the WWII. Capitalism has been hit by yet another strong wave, most probably the strongest wave. People are thinking that it is not the best political system. State has intervened into the market very strongly and for the first time since the globalization theory came into existence, the large corporates have not opposed the role of the state in market intervention. Rather, many large corporations around the world have already appealed the state to save them from the nearing crash. The US, for the first time in decades, seems to love socialism and the pressure from the public is surmounting against the Trump administration to announce help packages for the working class. The world once again has realized that ultimately there are only two classes–the rich and the poor–and that the first priority of the rich is protect their property.

The answer to life after Corona crisis would be hypothetical. But, apparently, some of the issues are bound to emerge. The largest of the free trading zone, the Eurozone, may face some challenges for its continuous existence in the same way. The European Union would possibly face some challenges since a new discourse emerging from small groups like Scandinavia or Baltic would definitely make it to the political debate. Many European countries that were hit by the Great Economic recession of 2008 were still struggling to come to the state before the crisis and they are further pushed backward by the Covid-19 crisis. There were some debates about the future of the EU after the 2008 economic recession, which further attracted attention of many nationalists especially after the Brexit.
On top of that, many nations even in the EU are building walls to protect their physical boundaries while they still are the members of the EU. Besides, US involvement in the warfare and its investment in the arms and ammunitions would be a matter of strong public debate in the next election. Many other so-called nationalist figures would possibly make their appearance in the office and nationalism will govern the political issue for years to come.
Two conspiracy theories have appeared in the social media with China and the US blaming each other for their role in introducing the deadly virus. Some other nations like Russia and Iran have joined the Chinese side while Israel has stood for the US block. This would go on for a long time even after this crisis is solved. However, the only mission of the whole world currently should be focused on the breakthrough of some sort of medicine or vaccine and help humanity.
Our thoughts should go to many health workers who are risking their lives, sacrificing their lives, controlling their emotions and putting their duty on top of their lives. All of us should express sincere gratitude and respect for these real heroes.

Nepal is lurching from crisis to crisis, albeit political in nature, but with God’s grace, she has been successful in overcoming them all.
Sovereign citizens have experience of observing tough times during the decade-long Maoist insurgency that claimed more than 13,000 lives. Still, we succeeded to get out of the grief and pain. Like all other tough times the country has countenanced, we shall manage to overcome the current Coronavirus pandemic.
Under the decree of the government of Nepal, lockdown has been imposed for a week, beginning from Tuesday as a precautionary measure. People are advised to stay at home so that the spread and contamination of virus could be curbed. The government has invoked Infectious Disease Act, 1964 to impose lockdown for a week to combat the possible outbreak of Covid-19 infection in the country. Issuing a notification on Monday, the government urged the people to stay home and not come out on the streets, except for urgent matters, such as medical urgency.
Domestic flights have been cancelled, vehicular movements have been banned and employees have been granted leave. The government has also clarified that the outliers would be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be more than one month; and/or also liable to fine of Rs 100 (Section 3). The Chief District Officer (i.e., executive Magistrate) has been empowered to implement the Act, 1964 (Section 4).
The Act, 1964 is home to as many as five Sections that merited enactment in then king Mahendra’s regime. Section 2 of the Act, 1964 confers a blanket power on the government to apply all necessary measures to combat with infectious diseases. It allows the government officials so empowered to issue any form of orders, whichever required, to control or abate the outbreak of infections. The officials are permitted to check or inspect any person, pedestrian, goods, vehicles or any if they have suspicion that the person or goods may carry infections.
Despite all this, the Act, 2020 BS (1964) nowhere prescribes welfare functions. The legislation does not necessarily oblige the government to ensure arrangement for food or other essential goods or services to its citizens.
Who will be hit hard during this lockdown? The hardest hit will be daily wage earners in urban and rural areas. They are the persons who deserve state’s support on immediate basis. The three tiers of government (i.e., central, provincial and local) should not escape from their responsibility to provide essential goods and services to the citizens. This is the opportune time for the instruments of the state to win the hearts and minds of the people.
Amid this Corona-lockdown, the shopkeepers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers have hoarded food, LPG Gas, mobile recharge cards among others. In Janakpurdham, the retailers and shopkeepers have hiked the price of essential commodities. They are taking this lockdown as an opportunity to earn as much they can.
The Constitution in its Article 48 enlists fundamental duties to be observed by every citizen. Acclaimed jurist Hohfeld argues that rights and duties are jural correlatives. He believes that it is unjust for a person to claim rights unless he fulfils his duties. It becomes the sovereign duty of every citizen to practise social distancing in a bid to curtail the outbreak of Covid-19.
However, people in Janakpur are not taking lockdown seriously. People are roaming on the streets for no good reason. Youths are playing cricket in 12-Bigha, an open space, morning and evening time as usual.
It would be unjust to claim right to move, which is envisaged under Article 17, in this virus-lockdown, which is a form of emergency. It’s the time to observe the duty. It’s time to stay under self-quarantine and help the state prevent the outbreak of Covid-19.
In India, police is found Lathicharging those roaming on roads for no reason amid Coronavirus lockdown. It’s high time we too adopt and implement the same practice to tame those who are untameable. Lathicharge for public good could in no way be interpreted as violation of human rights. After all, it’s time to save humans first from the deadly Corona; we cannot think of rights unless we have humans to claim it for.
We must not spend our energy and focus on criticism and blame games. We were together during all the tough times; we should take a pledge to overcome this deadly epidemic. The only need of hour is to go for self-quarantine to prevent the spread of Coronavirus.

The fight against Corona is akin to wartime situations. But, it’s a different kind of war where enemies are not visible with naked eyes. The health professionals and doctors are tirelessly engaged in saving the lives. They are in the hospitals, that is out of their homes, for us and we have to stay at our homes to prevent the spread of Corona.
As per media reports, the world has witnessed 421,792 infected patients, and 18,882 deaths till date. Of them, the number of infected patients stands at 562 and death toll reaches 11 in India. We don’t deserve to face the same fate.
We have to bear in mind that in an epidemic-like situation, when transmission happens rapidly, it becomes an uphill task for the state to overcome it in a given time frame. Collectively can we help the state the state to break the chain of transmission by adopting strategies like self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine procedures.

The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has haunted not only China but the entire world. However, the effort the Chinese Government has put to fight against it is endearing.
Many had put their bets on the disease humbling China both politically and economically. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross reportedly said, “Coronavirus could help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America”. At a time when trade war is continuing between the US and China, US might have smelled an economic opportunity of seeing China drowned by the virus.
As the media reports suggest, the pandemic definitely has ebbed the Chinese economy. People are suffering and grieving due to the disease. Despite that, China seems to have propelled ahead with the confidence by almost eradicating the disease from its land when the rest of the world is in panic because of the pandemic.
The present planetary catastrophe has shown us a vivid picture of world politics. Unlike in the past, US supervision is missing in this global calamity. US scholars are consistently blaming the White House for creating power vacuum during the hours of a pandemic.  Isn’t this a manifestation of the rudderless superpower?
There is a saying in English: “Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door.” At present the mousetrap could be the vaccination of the coronavirus which is yet to be invented or maybe the country which better deals with the pandemic and helps other for the same.
In this regard, the novel coronavirus could be a way of showing the efficiency of the Chinese political system to the world. Despite the initial cover-up and the tragic consequences, Chinese rulers are now moving to make the present situation as a definite positive momentum to showcase how the world see its political system and what it actually is. On the other hand, victory over coronavirus would be no less than the winning the ‘People’s War’ for the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
When the superiority of ideology is in the contest, the media, mostly from the western countries, are blaming the Chinese government’s incompetence to fight against the disease which broke out from China to the entire world. Was China alone culpable for the spark of the disease?
Yes, we can say this. Had the Chinese government heeded to the voice of the doctor who had whistled the symptoms of the coronavirus at the earliest, the situation would have been different. But the accidental eruption of the disease was no one’s fault. It is a known fact that the disease knows no boundaries.  In this given circumstance is it tenable to lambast China for closing the barn door after the horse got out?
Albeit with the passing of time the global public health community has widely praised China’s quick work to address the ongoing pandemic and sharing the virus genome sequence. One of the many reasons for China being praised this time is because China is sharing how the disease is disrupting its social and economic daily functions.
Eventually, this information had given the clue to the rest of the world how severe the disease is. The praise for China has not come out of the blue, but is in comparison to the SARS outbreak of 2003 where China was criticized for its rigidity in sharing the internal information about the disease to the rest of the world.

In this context, China not only has fought hard against COVID-19 within its territory but also is sharing its expertise with the rest of the world. China itself is fighting against the fierce disease. It could have opted to cocoon itself precisely in this difficult hour but has come up to help the other countries in need.
A team of Chinese experts went to Iraq’s capital Baghdad as a part of China’s assistance in confronting the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. China has transferred its expertise to other countries which are prone to the virus. Iraq is just an example.
China put a valiant effort to contain the disease nevertheless the disease has embraced the rest of the globe, resulting in a pandemic. Slowly but steadily, the Chinese government has brought the situation under the control in its land. But we live in an interconnected world. Therefore, the global effort is indispensable to suppress the disease. There is no time for lone wolf-heroism.

The local authorities seem to be very enthusiastic in welcoming new ideas. They have been adopting new technologies to reach to their people. “People are spending a day or two days’ time visiting municipality or ward offices for a minor work,” says the deputy mayor Ambika Chalaune of Panchadewal Binayak Municipality, Achham district. “And we are also facing difficulties to communicate with our people.”
She added that at a time when most of the houses own at least one smart phone, “we are trying to use it as an opportunity”.
As a result – the concept of ‘SmartPalika’ evolved.
“The name Smartpalika, itself is smart, so there’s no doubt that it will help us improve our communication system in reaching to the public easily,” says Jamuna Bohora, Deputy Mayor of Jorayel Rural Municipality, Doti district. Bohora hopes that the launch of ‘Smartpalika’ will help them in many ways including gathering information of the available resources in the municipality and easily disseminating messages to the service seekers among others.
“This will eventually help in the development planning process of the municipality,” says Bohora.
It is believed that this system will save significant time and effort for the day to day tasks of municipal staff in terms of information management, ward services, vital registration systems, municipality profiles, notices of events, meetings, and processes.
The application is also a tool to connect elected representatives with the citizens. It includes a complaints mechanism which is easy and confidential for citizens to use.

“In the past, there have been several issues of responding to people’s grievances so the app will help to respond to those grievances in no time. It will end the ‘gap’ between the authority and the people,” says Bidur Bastola, MEAL Manager at DCA Nepal office.
The household profiling doesn’t just include the names and the number of households, but a detailed profile, categorized by sex, age, and any physical disability (or not), education status, number of children, their economic situation, whether they are below the poverty line or not, how much land they own, their agricultural production details, access to road, water supply, hospital, school and toilets among others. The data bank also contains information about the training received by household members, their formal educational status, and the jobs they are doing. This will enable the municipality to identify the situation of human resources in the areas – and whether they are employed or not.
With the technical support from PARIWARTAN project funded by the European Union and implemented by DCA with local partners: Equality Development Center (EDC) in Doti, Malika Development Organisation (MDO) in Achham and the technical partner, Inlogos; Panchadewal Binayak Municipality, Chaupati Rural Municipality and Mangalsen Municipality in Achham district and KI Singh Rural Municipality, Jorayel Rural Municipality and Shikhar Municipality in Doti district, are bracing up to adopt this digital shift.
“This will be the backbone of good management for our municipality,” Deputy Mayor of Ambika says. Echoing Amkiba’s statement Deputy Mayor Jamuna says, “The system will help in establishing ‘good governance’ with transparent services.”
The ward authorities will not have to visit the municipality office with bulky documents to update the numbers. They can do it online now – and it will be accessible for the people having a username and password.
In addition to this, the municipal dwellers can be reached easily through push notification or SMS system.
“This will help the municipality to spread its scheme like trainings, other opportunities and notices to the people in one go,” says Deputy Mayor Ambika. “This will save our time so that we can focus on other things.”
According to her, this also ensures people’s right to information as they will have access to all the information related to the municipality.
It will also help in municipal decision making.
The municipality will have enough information to recommend to donors where to invest and who the beneficiaries are. “Now we can plan ahead – we can allocate budget for water supply systems, enterprise promotion, schools, and health centers in the area where people are in dire need of such facilities,” Deputy Mayor Ambika added.
Mukesh Kunwar, IT officer at Chaurpati Rural Municipality, Achham district, believes that the online system will help in ‘proper use of resources’. “These data will be GIS-based so that the municipal authorities sitting in the office can see the exact location of the communities’ households – nearest school, health centers, road, water supply schemes, touristic places, public places among others,” Kunwar says.
The ‘limited internet access and low literacy rates are the main challenges in understanding the intended message to its successful implementation.
However, all these municipalities have already started mitigating these issues. “We have started by setting up WiFi services at ward offices and secondary schools as a start,” says Bohora. “The government is committed to reach to the households with proper internet services.”

The similar arrangements have been done in other municipalities too.
“The data collection work has been completed. In some, municipalities data verification is on going. Some have even started uploading all relevant information provisioned in the citizen charter and government rules and regulation needed for the service seekers,” says Malati Maskey, Programme Manager at DCA who also leads the PARIWARTAN project.
Maskey believes that the proper functioning of Smartpalika will bring a ‘revolution’ in these municipalities and help in establishing ‘Good Governance’ system.

With the aggressive spread of COVID-19 across the world, unverified news of it being a bio-weapon has been spreading rapidly through social media platforms, text messages, and even through mainstream media. Even the intelligentsia suspects the possible engineering of SARS-CoV-2, the strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19, in a research facility.
Previously, people in the world were acquainted with computer viruses that affected their mobiles, computers, and other electronic gadgets. This is the first time in history people across nations have been suspecting the creation of biological virus and fearing that it could be the result of genetic manipulation.
The suspicion became viral after the Washington Times in January 2020 ran a news story suggesting that the virus may have originated in a lab linked to China’s bio-warfare program. Fox News also published a story on April 15 claiming the disease to have likely originated in the Wuhan lab, as a Chinese plot to compete with the US. Similar stories have inundated Facebook and Twitter posts and WhatsApp messages.
The lab origin theory
Massive casualty shattering world economy and peril lurking around causes people to become paralyzed with deep fear. Such fear and cluelessness about the origin of the pandemic has forced people to ask whether the virus is biologically engineered or not.
Scientists around the world have said that the lab origin theory of the virus is baseless.
Immunologist Nigel McMillan from the Menzies Health Institute Queensland says that SARS-CoV-2, the virus strain that causes COVID- 19, is natural and no system exists in the lab till today to manufacture it.
The University of Sydney Evolutionary Virologist Edward Holmes has explained that the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 is a bat virus named RaTG13, which was kept at the Wuhan Institute of Technology (WIV) and the level of genome sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is equivalent to an average of 50 years of evolutionary change. He says that there is no chance that SARS-CoV-2 was engineered.
COVID-19 is the product of natural evolution, according to the findings of Kristian Andersen, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research.
So, science strongly rejects the possibility of the engineering of the COVID-19 virus and classifies the associated story as a hoax and a conspiracy theory. Though the present world has made advancements in science unparalleled in history, it has not acquired the capability to induce mutation in a virus to create a new strain. So, two theories that COVID-19 virus is a biological weapon invented to destroy enemy lives and the virus may have escaped erroneously out of a lab are big fat lies.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has called the spread of such kind of wrong information ‘infodemic’ and has cautioned everyone to be aware.
Reasons for the spreading of rumors
Politicization of the pandemic is the main reason behind the spreading of such rumors. Politics in recent times has not been about rationality and reality. We are living in a world in which the human mind welcomes any answers for complicated problems and politics jumps in to exploit it.
History has time and again shown that political partisans have unashamedly propagandized blatant lies. It is human nature to blame others rather than bearing responsibility and rectifying it because it is too painful to accept one’s fault. Political partisans play blame games and augment propaganda because such activity serves their interest by diverting public attention from their failures and from the real issues while also tarnishing others’ image.
The US has been the worst hit by the pandemic and has faced an embarrassing debacle in containing the spread of the virus. Laggard response and bungled handling of the pandemic by President Donald Trump’s administration relative to the quick response and efficient management of Asian nations like Vietnam, China and South Korea has tarnished the US’s image. With impending elections, the spread of misinformation vilifying China can win voters for the contenders in the world’s superpower nation.
The second reason is psychological. Daniel Kahneman, an American psychologist and Nobel laureate in Economics, says that when humans process too much complex information they automatically use mental shortcuts. The author of the world bestseller Thinking Fast and Slow says that the brain is lazy and curbs the usage of its bigger potential, allowing people to draw quick conclusions, and in turn, leading to errors. Thus quickly arriving at a conclusion using mental short-cuts without rationally checking the facts is a cause for falling for this hoax.
The other reason is that people are preyed upon by some media which unhesitatingly scatter misinformation. Some also do it to deliver sensation for political and monetary benefits. The spread, amplification and reinforcement of misinformation on the internet and social media platforms have been encouraged by lack of appropriate censorship. At a time when a large population has been forced to remain insides houses and offices, the misinformation spreads like wildfire as people have fewer tasks to execute and more time to browse through social media platforms.

“We’re all going to die!” This feeble appeal came in a Facebook phonecall with B. Thapa from his village in the Nepal’s eastern hills.
Our conversation was in early March when news headlines from Italy and the U.S. began to alarm Nepalis. With no information about the spread of the disease in his country, this schoolteacher assumed a bleak scenario. “If advanced European and American societies are swamped with this disease, unable to control it, what can we expect?”
Indeed. The country has a porous 1,000 mile border with India; it has no national health system and the current government (Maoist/Communist-led!) has promoted private clinics and hospitals over public facilities; its leader, Prime Minister Oli, just had a second kidney transplant without naming any surrogate leader to handle the crisis; there’s almost no medical equipment of the kind needed to test Covid-19; hundreds of thousands of approximately five million migrant workers abroad whose remittances keep Nepal economically afloat are now jobless and heading home; and Kathmandu’s swollen population, fearful of congestion in the city, are fleeing to their villages across the land, possibly carrying the virus with them.
Thapa’s fear is repeated by others I speak to. I know about his nation’s truly weak medical system; I agree that the administration is incompetent and deeply corrupt. Yet, I argue, “Nepal’s many doctors will ensure no one hides the facts. You have an aggressive free press now; it will expose any sign of the epidemic and force government action.”
At that time, a month ago, there had been no reported Covid-19 deaths in Nepal, and three infected individuals—all traced to Nepalis who’d arrived from abroad. No one believed those figures; the public’s past experience on a host of issues and endemic corruption in official circles results in widespread cynicism; the government cannot handle this crisis, they say. Most Nepalis, like millions of people across the globe, depend on remittances from overseas workers, and food imports (since the outflow of labor left fields uncultivated). What options do Nepalis have to handle a looming epidemic?
Without warning, the government announced a countrywide lockdown. Everyone was to remain in their homes. Schools and businesses were ordered closed. The quarantine is as severe as anywhere in the world, perhaps with the exception of China. Only policemen are seen in the lanes and roads. A colleague in Lahan village in Janakpur near India exclaims that even motorbikes and rickshaw bicycles are prohibited on local roads. Shopping for food is restricted; inter-city buses are halted; remittance agencies and banks are closed. Police and special security forces are deployed to Nepal’s border with India to prevent Nepali laborers who work in India from returning home, creating Nepali refugee camps inside India.
There was one announcement of Chinese medical supplies arriving by air (ordered by the U.N. Population Fund and various embassies). Otherwise thirty million Nepalis seemed to be on their own.
Six weeks into the pandemic, one has to scroll far down the coronavirus world register (ranked by number of infections)– past New Zealand with 16 deaths, Japan (323), Singapore (12), Cuba, (43), Ghana (9), Lebanon (22), etc. to find Nepal–with zero deaths and just 43 infections reported (as of April 23, 2020).
Many citizens simply don’t believe their government figures. They argue it’s incapable of even registering the cases. Some Nepali news outlets call out the administration’s incompetence. On the other hand, many citizens suggest that low rate is indeed a result of their strict adherence to the lockdown and the police’s zero tolerance of any defiance of the quarantine. Privately people adopt simple home remedies and advice gleaned from the internet. Families remain especially attentive to the abundant deities they live with and worship. And traditional places of refuge—temples and ashrams whose custodians offer hospitality at any time—are expanding their capacity to feed the needy.
Today, criticism of Nepal’s passive administration is surprisingly tepid. For weeks, returning overseas migrant laborers languished at the border camps. Many jobless men were forced to walk 10-14 days from their workplaces in one part of Nepal to reach their home village. The government seemed insensitive. (Finally, on April 17, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that the government must provide transport to those walking from Kathmandu and other cities to their destination.)
“We watch what’s happening overseas. Without the service structure other countries have, we must adopt this strict regime,” another colleague insists. “We have no equipment, no medical facilities, no capable governmental services, and no real leadership.”
In another month, we will have a clearer picture of Nepal’s state of health. If the nation misses this plague, it’s severe adherence to the simple formula of distancing and lockdown should bolster national confidence. It could be the start of a needed course of self-reliance.

Every sector is impacted by COVID-19. Transportation is completely closed. Small to large scale businesses are closed. Health Institutions have limited treatment procedures to emergency cases only. Media have limited themselves to online media and reduced or stopped print papers. Government and non-government offices are closed. Even the internet we are using has slowed down due to increased users. Unsurprisingly, this is the same case all over the world.
Among others, education sector has been the most impacted sector. All government and private institutions are closed. Many have started online classes but not all.
In the past, schools/colleges were closed by few days of bandhs and chakka jams. Classes used to run behind academic schedule. After the re-opening of classes, teachers used to teach at metro train-like-speed to complete the course within the academic schedule. That used to hamper students’ learning ability and teachers’ teaching ability. And that used to happen even when the classes were closed for just a week. This time, it has already been a month that academic institutions are closed.
In this pandemic situation, few colleges and universities have adopted online mode of learning. School of Education, Kathmandu University is among the few that has adopted the same. Adoption of distance learning does not have long history in Nepal. Like in other sectors, learning through online mode has also its own share of opportunities and challenges. Here, I have tried to reflect those (major ones) based on my experience after attending three weeks of classes at Kathmandu University.
Challenges
Internet facilities:
In the current context, not all students across the country have access to high speed and uninterrupted internet facilities. People are taking service from internet service providers or buying internet packages from NTC/Ncell. None of them guarantee smooth operating internet facilities. Packages from NTC/Ncell supply decent quality of internet facility but these are short term and costlier in comparison to regular internet services. One of the students shared with the writer that he has spent already more than Rs. 3,000 for data package during lockdown for official meetings and classes. In country like ours, it’s way too expensive.
Laptop facilities: 
In reality, there are thousands of students who don’t have a laptop and are still dependent on either friend’s computer or cybercafes for report writing or for computer required activities. Based on this experience, taking classes through mobile phones may serve the purpose but they are not effective at all.
Online classes significantly limit the interaction between students. Without much interaction, teaching-learning mode becomes monotonous.
Interaction: 
Classes become effective if there is more interaction and discussion. During regular classes, students often interact and discuss with students or teachers on a topic. Online classes significantly limit the interaction between students. Without much interaction, teaching-learning mode becomes monotonous. At the same time, students may not get adequate time to be clear on taught courses.
Observation and Change in teaching modality: 
In regular classes, the lecturer can closely observe student’s behavioral aspect and can understand whether the courses are being understood and acknowledged by student or not. Based on observation, lecturers tend to change their teaching modality instantly. But in case of distance learning, the aspect of close observation of students’ behavior is of distant possibility that further limits the potentiality of application of diverse teaching-learning modality.
Practical and group exercises: 
In case of many technical courses, it requires a lot of practical and exercises. Online classes limit the possibility of doing exercises and group activities. Theory-based course can be easily delivered but that is not the same for courses requiring group activities, demonstrations and practical activities.
Opportunities
Easy enrollment
People after completing +2 level are compelled to migrate to urban areas for quality higher studies. Also, many people need to wait for years to come to Kathmandu and enroll in their course of choice. Talking about myself, I needed to wait for more than four years to pursue M. Phil. course as I was out of Kathmandu Valley. Had there any opportunities of academic course through online mode, thousands of students could have easily enrolled in courses of their choice from any part of the country. This helps to continue learning without having break, which helps to have better learning ability.
Income for institutions: 
There lies the high possibility of enrollment, if there is good promotion, proven and effective delivery of courses. Not only inside the country but also students from any part of the world can inquire and enroll. With an increased enrollment and increased number of students, educational institutions’ incomes are increased. Now, countries like the US, the UK and Australia are known for countries with greater revenue generation from academic institutions. If there lies the potentiality of attracting student from abroad, Nepal can generate revenue from academic institutions i.e. from enrollment of foreign students.
Time, Cost, Energy and Concentration: 
In the last 10 years, the number of students who are also enrolled in a job has drastically increased. With increasing inflation rate and the competitive market, it does not seem, the number of lower down in coming days. For people who are enrolled in a job and academic courses, they get it difficult in terms of time management. Either job-class or class-job, their life becomes hectic and tedious. Because of requirement of travel in between, energy is drained and that affect their learning ability. If there is facility of online mode, student do not need to rush for classes. This saves time, helps to keep them fresh and energetic. Similarly, when there are regular classes, administrative cost goes higher either it be furniture, infrastructures, and staffs. Applying online mode can reduce cost for both student as well as academic institution.
Participation and review lectures: 
As we have seen quite often, not all students get easy to interact in classroom. There will always be some 30-40 percent of students who interact often while other take part in less frequent manner. Because of personality issue or hesitancy or speech anxiety or some other issues, the participation of student is quite uneven. Online mode helps student to express their queries and understanding through writing mode. Also, while in classes, there is tendency to get confused about terms or relate the theory with practical aspects. While being online, student can simultaneously listen to lecturers, and upon confusion can search in Google, understand the meaning/concept, and relate to practicality. It increases understanding ability of student that cannot be said in terms of regular classes.

Future of distance learning
Everything has its own opportunities and challenges. COVID-19 has taught many things in every sector. Though, there were talks about the need of online learning mode in academic courses in last decade or so, none of them led to any conclusion. But COVID-19 forced academic institutions and regulatory bodies to think about the online learning mode as well. While few adopted online learning for temporary manner during COVID-19, majority are still reluctant to think and adopt it.
Can distance learning be replicated and converted into regular learning mode? Looking at current experiences and learnings, it seems challenging. However, the opportunities of distance learning can not be neglected. It requires greater coordination, expertise, initial investment and commitment from academic institutions as well as regulatory bodies. Being a student with few weeks of experience continuing job and classes simultaneously, I see the online learning mode making significant impact in all aspects i.e. student’s career, reputation of academic institutions and economy of country.

VYCCU Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization based in Gaindakot-8, Nawalpur has regularly delivered its day-to-day service by providing personal protective equipment (PPEs) to its frontline employees.
Adhering to its organizational motto of providing services to its member from ‘womb to tomb’, VYCCU is continually providing its service even during the never-ever experienced difficult time.
In doing so, VYCCU has come up with emergency service plan including safety orientations, arrangement of protective gear and financial incentives for frontline employees, waiver in interest rates, formation of risk management taskforce, relief loan to its members and doorstep service to the indigent clients during emergency, informed Prem Prasad Sapkota ‘Raju’, secretary of the cooperative organization.
The organization developed the emergency plan and continued the service in keeping with the most-essential service delivery directives of the government, safety protocols recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and different guidelines circulated by the Department of Cooperatives, Nepal Federation of Savings and Credit Cooperative Unions Limited (NEFSCUN) and National Cooperative Bank Limited as well as the letter and spirit of the cooperative principles, Sapkota added.
VYCCU Chief Executive Officer Madhab Prasad Poudel shared the single-purpose cooperative organization with a base of 75,000 members and annual turnover of Rs 5 billion is continually delivering service such as cash deposit, cash payment, loan re-payment and remittance to its members facing problem due to lockdown enforced to stop the outbreak of COVID-19.
Keeping members’ demand in mind, the organization has been providing daily service from its head office and all 17 service centres in Nawalpur and Chitwan during the critical time. In an average 500 to 600 members are daily receiving necessary service from its points, the official record revealed.
“Each member seeking service washes hand with soap, use sanitizer and also maintain physical distancing while receiving service,” Poudel said.
All the service centres have been arranged with hand-washing soap and water, sanitizer at entrance and service delivery point, logbook with records of service recipients as well as draw-box. Likewise, money deposited from members has also been sanitised for three days as part of safety protocol, Poudel said. Among other safety arrangements placed are staff rotational duty, office vehicular service and work from home for the officer level staffs responsible for policy, planning and reporting.
Arrangements have been put in place in a way that members could receive most of the services including mobile recharge, utilities payments and cash transfers from home and free of cost ATM service.
Secretary Sapkota further explained, “VYCCU in accordance with its emergency plan has initiated lending Rs 15,000 each to the members facing problem in eking out daily livelihood for three months without any interest,” he said, adding the organization will pay medical bills of Rs 50,000 in case of hospital emergency such as maternity service and accident which the recipients should pay back within two months.
As per the central bank directive, the cooperative organization also has decided to waive 10 percent in the interest of the loan taken by its members up to 4 July 2020 (end of Nepali month Asar).
According to the official record, five members have so far received emergency medical payment service and 492 received doorstep service since the emergency plan came into effect.
Guman Bahadur Adhikari, a local of Gaindakot-11 and a member of VYCCU, was supported with the medical emergency service while he was helpless at hospital during treatment.
“Receiving service at the very difficult time at hospital gave me a feeling that there was a mercy of god itself to rescue my hubby,” his wife Tulasi Adhikari recounted with tears in happiness.
Likewise, another member Manilal Mahato, a local of Gaindakot-12, received doorstep service with cash which he said “was a big help for him during the time of lockdown to take his mother to hospital.”
Her mother is still being treated at Intensive Care Unit at Bharatpur Hospital. Besides, the cooperative organization has ramped up its member education and awareness on the existing emergency services through the medium of community radio (Vijaya FM 101.6, official facebook page and VYCCU apps.
“The members are being approached with financial literacy, preventive measures against COVID-19 and health and hygiene through Public Service Announcements and dedicated radio programme”, the secretary informed.
VYCCU is continuing its full-fledged service when all local cooperatives have shut their service and banks also limit their operation amidst lockdown. With this unswerving commitment for member service, VYCCU has established the notion that cooperatives indeed are in need.
In the earlier days of the lockdown, VYCCU also disrupted its regular service, Poudel said, adding, “We however reached out to members through doorstep service by mobilizing focal persons of service centres”.
“As the human crisis grows with the elongation of lockdown against COVID-19, we decided to proactively continue member service. It is a testing time for us whether the existing hardware and software structures and mechanisms of VYCCU – one of the most capable cooperative organizations of the country – can manage crisis and deliver services”, Poudel added.
VYCCU came to life in 1992 under the initiative of Vijay Development Resource Centre with the slogan “Saving is seed for development” and the movement kick-started with each member contributing 50 paisa a day.
VYCCU has received the International ACCSS (A1 Cooperative Choice for Excellence in Service and Soundness) Brand of Asian Standard being assessed on the basis of four criteria – financial capability, member service, operational efficiency, and consistency in learning and expansion.
ACCESS brand – developed by NEFSCUN with the technical support of Association of Asian Confederation of Credit Unions (ACCU) – is a tool to institutionalize the SACCOS and enhance its services to the members.
Highlighting the role of cooperative organizations, cooperative expert Keshab Prasad Sapkota said, “The cooperative should design and deliver protective packages to boost up the confidence of poor and indigent people.
This is critically important because the rich people can somehow manage their lives even during difficult time but the lower-rung people are always at the receiving end of the crisis”.
The COVID-19 crisis will surely increase risks to the cooperative organizations mainly in their operations, service delivery modality and safety and sustainability arrangements, he said, adding, “The cooperative organization with institutionalized good governance and community trust however can thrive in difficult time and provide much-needed service to its members”.
He further noted the reduction in income generating opportunities and production measures in and aftermath of lockdown may result in widening the vicious circle of multi-dimensional poverty and increase the number of poor in society.
The disruption of supply chain and subsequent rise in inflation as well as its multifarious effects on the health, education and livelihood of members will create big challenges in coming days, he said, adding, “In order to manage the imminent situation, the cooperatives working in the close network of grassroots people should explore alternative service delivery mechanisms such as virtual points, call centres and mobile banking and nearby service centres during the critical times and tailor service packages in a way to promote viable micro enterprises and revitalize embattled lives of the members.

http://english.lokaantar.com/articles/ordinances-issued-withdrawn-pm-thinking/,"Randhir Chaudhary

When the entire globe is locked down and scared of the rampant transmission of coronavirus (Covid-19), PM KP Sharma Oli orchestrated irrelevant political drama by issuing two ordinances related to the political party and the Constitutional Council. After hue and cry, the government has withdrawn both the ordinances.
Just after issuing the ordinances, people started venting their anger against the government on social sites. The ordinance related to political party got the bigger rap. The amendment in the law about political parties maintained that any group within a party having support of 40 percent members of its parliamentary party Committee or central committee can split the party. Previously, no one could split the party without having 40 percent of supporters in both the committees.
More importantly, it shocked the people when the president Bidya Devi Bhandari green signaled the ordinances the same day it was issued. It was endorsed so swiftly that she forgot to notice that when she was endorsing or issuing the ordinances, secretariat meeting called to discuss the ordinances was going on.
This knee-jerk acts of Prime Minister and the President have raised some affairs in particular which needs to be pondered upon. Meantime, this has also resulted in unification of two political parties which must have hammered the ill motive of KP Oli to bring fragmentation into those parties. Let’s shed some light upon the current episode categorically.
When the full concentration of the government must have to manage hand and mouth to the daily wage earners and firmly stand with the front line fighters against Covid-19, why Oli government brought the ordinances? How the President Office issued it without having serious study and consultation? It has shown that for KP Oli, his politics and personal vendetta with his counterpart politicians are his prime concerns. It also proves that he is not being able to serve the nation now. Importantly, as the president hurriedly justified Oli’s move it’s an inkling of many political catastrophic in future as well. President’s duty is to abide by and protect the constitution and to promote national integrity from all dynamics.
There is a bitter saying about democracy is that the democracy is one of the worst systems but there is also no better alternative of it. The political system remains within the democratic framework. It is also true that a president cannot be elected without the support of political parties. As the presidents comes with background of particular political party, the party always seeks some benefit from the office of the president. Despite of these bitter facts, it’s the responsibility of the president in political system like Nepal, to meet the basic doctrine being the president. President must not act as the cadre of her/his erstwhile political party. Today, President Bidya Devi Bhandari has been facing volley of criticisms from different quarters of her own citizens. One thing President has to keep in mind that, a president is not an individual rather it’s an institution which runs by the tax of people where people pins their hopes to get the system to be followed democratically.
Another, when the ordinance related to the political party got public it winded up the calmness within Rastriya Janta Party Nepal (RJP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) that Oli has ill intention of splitting these parties. Few leaders of Samjawadi party were picked up to Kathmandu as well and kept under warm hospitality of PM Oli. These facts are now in the public domain. Reflecting the intention of Oli, Dr. Surendra Yadav who reportedly kidnapped from his home, said, “I could not have meeting with PM Oli while I was in the part of Oli Cabinet recently. Wondering why Oliseemd so eager to meet me”.
Toppping it all, the move of Prime Minister and President [the way President shown her hurriedness…] brought RJP and SP on the same page with high pace and subsequently they released a statement depicting they are principally agreed to merge the parties which would be named JantaSamajwadi Party[People’s Socialist Party]. Unification of these two parties must have hurt PM Oli as his mala fide intention got wiped up. It also has pushed the possibility of dividing party away.Meantime, Oli and the so-called nationalist politicians from the establishment side must take it as a lesson that they have political threat from the parties who they claim regional. This unification has been bolstering the aspiration of who believes in politics and agenda of identification of the marginalized communities since long back.

Now PM Oli has decided to withdraw the ordinances back after having consultation with law experts. First, it means he did not have any consultation with experts prior to bringing the ordinances? Second, Oli’s gravity in the general and the intra party is declining day by day as his health is being. Third, Oli should be sensitive and must think on his position whether it’s good to be adhere with the chair or should handover the position of PM?
In contemporary politics, being robust with ideology and its implementation would always be accepted by the people. But when a leader centers politics around her/him, it can never be accepted and justified even by the blind followers. Finally Oli has been proven to be a failed politician and he is not eligible to do politics. As the entire nation is fighting Covid-19, Nepal is seeking a leader who can benefit the people.

The Qatari Government has made wearing of face masks mandatory from Sunday (April 26) until further notice for government and private sector employees and clients, shoppers at food and catering stores and workers in the contracting sector.
Violators will attract imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years and a fine not exceeding QR200, 000, or one of the two penalties as stipulated in Decree Law No. (17) for 1990 regarding the prevention of infectious diseases.
The Cabinet also decided that the official working hours during the holy month of Ramadan this year will be four hours per day in the government sector and six hours in the private sector.
While the employees and workers in the government sector will work from 9am to 1pm, the timing for the private sector is 9am to 3pm.
Foodstuff stores, pharmacies, and restaurants working on deliveries and the contracting sector are excluded from the application of this decision. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry, in co-ordination with the authorities concerned, shall determine the other necessary activities exempted from this decision.
The previous exceptions decided by the Cabinet with regard to working hours shall continue.
It was decided that employees and workers in the government and private sectors whose work requires providing services to the public and clients are obliged to wear masks while carrying out their duties and tasks.
Clients visiting government and private sector offices are also required to wear masks. The officials concerned should take the necessary measures to prevent the entry of clients who are not wearing masks.
Shoppers are obligated to wear masks before they enter food and catering stores and during shopping, and those responsible for these shops must take the necessary measures not to allow the entry of non-compliant shoppers.
Workers in the contracting sector are obligated to wear masks while carrying out their duties and tasks, and officials in this sector should provide these masks and adhere to the established precautionary measures.
Likewise, Germany has also announced plans to make face masks mandatory to combat the spread of coronavirus.
Mask use will be compulsory on public transport throughout Germany, and nearly all states will also make face coverings compulsory when shopping.
Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly recommended their use last week when she eased lockdown rules.
Also, Austria made the use of face mask compulsory when shopping at the start of this month, but in other side, Switzerland confirmed it would not make its citizens wear masks as it loosened its restrictions.

Kathmandu, 22 April 2020 – World Vision International Nepal (WVIN), has supported 1000 PPEs and 120 Infrared (IR) thermometers to the Government of Nepal on 22 April amidst concerns about spread of COVID-19 in the country. The PPE sets and hygiene kits were handed over to the Ministry of Health and Population by Honorable Minister of Women, Children and Senior Citizens, Parbat Gurung at the premises of the Ministry with the presence of few government representatives. Each kit comprises of 19 different items including protective gears and medical supplies. WVINsupported the governments with PPE sets and hygiene kits as a part of its three-month comprehensive response plan to scale up the government’s preventive efforts to limit spread of the virus in the country, and support children, women and the most vulnerable families impacted by COVID-19.
During the handover event, Hon’ble Minister of Women, Children and Senior Citizen, Parbat Gurung said, “Nepal Government recently decided to mobilise non-governmental organizations to curb COVID-19 spread after cabinet’s decision.Following the decision, World Vision International Nepal has handed over medical supplies to the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens considering the immediate need of the government to prevent spread of CoVID-19. With the facilitation of Social Welfare Council, World Vision is probably the first international non-governmental organization that approached the Ministry with alarge quantity of medical supplies. These supplies will reach to 13 districts including critically affected district Udayapur at present.I would like to encourage all the other international and national organisations to coordinate with the Ministry considering immediate needs of the government for response activities.”

National Director of WVIN Janes Imanuel Ginting highlighted, “Being an active partner of the Government of Nepal (GoN), we are committed to supporting the government in its mission to prevent outbreak of coronavirus in the country. Since 2001, World Vision has been advertently supporting with the government to address national development priorities as well as humanitarian crisis including the earthquakes of 2015. Our COVID-19 response, focuses our existing working districts but we are committed to supporting other districts/areas if the situation demands. As a child-focused organisation, World Vision is humbled to contribute to efforts undertaken to support well-being of children in Nepal. We remain committed to address development gaps by aligning our works with the GoN’s social and economic development priorities and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).”
WVIN’s first 30 days of the response focused on preparedness by supplying much need PPE to health facilities and medical professionals, and support government on preventive messaging through traditional and social media. Beyond 30 days, the response will focus on addressing immediate needs of the affected families and communities and subsequently supporting them to restore their livelihoods through multi-sectorial (health, education, protection and livelihood) initiatives. Keeping children at the core, the response will be implemented across 14 working districts of WVIN initially with room for expansion to other districts/areas depending on the need.

The State of Qatar’s Ministry of Administrative Development, Labor and Social Affairs has said that “The employee’s wage and benefits, including the provision of food and accommodation or the payment of allowances, should not change as a result of teleworking.”
Teleworking is an important component of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, revealed in the Ministry’s website Tuesday.
Issuing guidelines about teleworking (work from home) for employees and management explaining their responsibilities and rights, the Ministry’s website has clearly mentioned that “as per the terms and provisions of employment contract, teleworking conditions of employment should remain the same as before.”
The Arab Gulf state- Qatar is one of the wealthiest in the world has welcomed millions of migrant skilled, semi-skilled and labourers.
From Nepal alone, there are nearly 500,000 skilled to raw-hand migrant workers have been contributing in the State of Qatar’s infrastructures development to hospitality management, service sector to house-hold activities, educational to vocational areas, health to agriculture, engineering to manufacturing management.
According to the guidelines, Regarding working hours, employers and teleworkers will finalized accordingly and during which they can be contacted. However, the number of teleworking hours should not exceed the average that was previously applied at the workplace. It should be noted that for most sectors, the working hours were reduced from 7am to 1pm (6 hours per day) during the crisis, said the information, stated in the information.
Regarding overtime and other issues, it will be decided on the basis of mutually agreed with the employer, added the information.
The employee’s home workspace can have a significant impact on the mental health of workers and should develop advanced strategies to address safety and health of teleworkers, it said and gave stressed that “the effective management of teleworking requires a result-based management approach. This involves identifying work objectives and tasks, and then monitoring and discussing progress.”
Heightened concerns over the new coronavirus outbreak has led many companies in the world to turn to teleworking as a safe alternative to potentially exposing their employees to the virus on public transport or in offices.
Teleworkers should maintain a balance between work and personal life by identifying a dedicated workspace and learning to disconnect from work at specified times reserved for rest and personal life.
The new trend allows employees to work from home or other remote locations using information technology comes an efforts to popularize the practice as a way to adopt teleworking as an emergency measure in times of disasters.

http://english.lokaantar.com/world/closed-industrial-area-streets-doha-will-partially-opened-wednesday/,"
Doha, 22 April (2020) – Spokesperson of the Supreme Committee for Crisis Management, Lolwah bint Rashid bin Mohammed Al Khater has said that the gradual opening of the closed part of Industrial Area begins from Wednesday, starting from street No 1 and 2 and Al Wakalat street.
The work will continue to open the remaining part of the area as per the medical information in the interests of the people, Lolwah bint Rashid bin Mohammed Al Khater said during The regular press conference this evening.
Around 6,500 workers were shifted in preparation to partially open the closed part. They were shifted to precautionary quarantine facilities to screen for early detection despite no symptoms of the infection for their and others safety in the area.
Ninety per cent of Coronavirus infections in Qatar are light and only 1% are serious cases, the spokesperson said.
Lolwah Al-Khater also mentioned that Qatar has the lowest death rate in the Arab world and one of the lowest in the world compared to the number of infected.
The first hike in COVID-19 cases occurred in March and was linked to the return of Qataris from abroad. Then we witnessed relative stability and then another rise related to the discovery of a group of cases from the Industrial area and this led to closure of the area.
Family visits were among the most important reasons for the spread of the Coronavirus among Qataris in particular.
She urged everyone to stay safe and stay home.
“It is necessary to continue applying preventive measures, the most important of which is not leaving the house except for necessities, wearing masks, washing and sanitizing hands and practicing adequate social distance, especially as we are entering the blessed month of Ramadan.
Lolwah bint Rashid bin Mohammed Al Khater stressed that this pandemic may remind us that God’s ability is above all ability and that we must from now on pay attention to what adds to our selves, our societies and our countries and seize the coincidence of the month of Ramadan with this pandemic to rearrange our priorities and focus on what is beneficial and constructive
We call upon all and urge to avoid family gatherings during Ramadan month,” HE the spokesperson said.
HE official Spokesperson of the Supreme Committee for Crisis Management Lolwah bint Rashid bin Mohammed Al Khater gave a presentation on coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis management in the State of Qatar, reviewing some indicators and numbers about recoveries and deaths, reassuring all about the safety of the approach followed in the face of the virus.
She explained that the recent increase in the number of virus infections is linked to an increase in the number of tests, and the adoption of a proactive screening approach with a view to discovering transitional strings … stressing that this is a healthy indicator in the first place.
She noted that the number of cases among Qataris is relatively stable after the rise in two consecutive days late last March .. adding that many of the discovered cases were mainly related to contacting within the same family and during family visits .. calling for avoiding gatherings, contacting and family visits during this period, especially with the advent of the month of Ramadan.
Her Excellency confirmed that the indications indicate that the State of Qatar is successfully managing the crisis “which is reflected in all indicators related to the virus.”
She explained that the percentage of detected infections in quarantine currently stands at 74 percent, while 26 percent are community-based cases, which means the health system has succeeded in containing the virus and limiting its spread thanks to the pre-emptive plans of the Ministry of Public Health.
As for cases severity , she pointed out that the numbers did not witness a major change, as 90 percent of cases were light and only 1 percent are classified as dangerous, while the recovery rate so far is 9 percent.
She added that the number of deaths reached only 9 cases among the total cases discovered, “a rate that is among the lowest in the world and the lowest at the level of countries in the region.”
She said that the number of cases in intensive care reached 72 cases, while the number of cases that left intensive care reached 52 cases.
She also indicated that the percentage of cases among males in general is 89% and 11% among females, while the percentage among Qatari males was 66.47% and among Qatari women 33.53%, and among expatriate males is 89.9% and the rest is among females.
The figures presented by HE Lolwah bint Rashid bin Mohammed Al Khater indicate that 36 percent of cases were in the age group between 25 and 34 years, 29 percent of them were in the age group (35 and 44 years), 14 percent in the category between (45 to 54 years), and 11 percentage in the category (15 to 24 years), 5 percent in the category between 55 and 64 years, and
2 percent only over the age of 64 years, the same percentage for the category between (5 and 14 years), and only 1 percent between the ages of 0 and 4 years.
Regarding recovery cases, she said that the ratio among males reached 80 percent and 20 percent for females, “given that the percentage of cases in males is the highest.”
HE Lolwah bint Rashid bin Mohammed Al Khater stressed the importance of reading the numbers correctly and using a scientific method to understand and receive the numbers, so that the results are correct .. warning that unscientific interaction with the numbers inevitably leads to inaccurate results that might cause concern to society.
She said, “The increase in the number of cases is a natural indicator of the ability of the health system to manage the crisis and contain cases as quickly as possible.” She added, “One of the important indicators is the ability of the health system to deal with cases, as is the case in Qatar, while experiences in many developed countries showed that they could not cope with the cases and contain the virus. ”
She emphasized that the health system in the State of Qatar is able to absorb the cases “and there is an abundance and scope to deal with the increase, which is an important indicator, and does not cause any concern at all” … noting that ” concerns rise when the health system could not respond to the needs of patients regardless of the type of disease.”
She stressed that the most important thing in the face of the coronavirus (Covid-19) is the people commitment of people to application of measures, warning that complacency may prolong the crisis.
She reiterated that the increase in the number of cases in recent times is an indication of the efficiency of search.. She said that the Ministry of Public Health does not conduct tests randomly, but through a dedicated team for search, which is the effective factor in curbing the virus spread.
She added, “Some countries in the world do not conduct proactive checks , but rather discover cases when patients go to hospitals after symptoms appear.” This means that there are cases that have not been discovered yet. “, Confirming that conducting accurate proactive checks is important to discover cases early and not leave it until symptoms appear to patients.
She said that the State of Qatar is among the highest countries in the number of checks in relation to the population reaching about 20000 and 200 per million people, while it is in leading countries such as Singapore reaching 16,000 per million and in Hong Kong it reaches 17,000 and 500 per million of the population.
HE Lolwah bint Rashid bin Mohammed Al Khater assured that the frequency of the checks continues, calling for avoiding inaccurate calculations and misreading the indicators and numbers of the checks .. She said, “There is a scientific approach for conducting checks in the State of Qatar, which is similar to what is going on in the leading countries in this regard.”

An amendment or fresh enactment aims to replace the “laws of imperfect obligation” which includes laws defining what a contract is, what a crime is or a law prescribing the right and duties of the subjects.
Perhaps, it is because of this reason the concept of amendment was introduced in order to make the legislation up-to-date. But could amendment or fresh enactment work as pill to cure all ills? If foreign precedents are taken into consideration, it gives a message that mere enactment is not a solution to every problem. In fact, the problem lies in implementation.
Take the example of India. The Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008 is brought into effect to provide for the social security and welfare of unorganised workers and for other matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The Act, which is home to as many as 17 sections, in its Section 3 (1) envisages for the welfare schemes for the unorganized workers that include: life and disability cover; health and maternity benefits; old age protection; and any other benefit as determined by the Central Government. The legislation does not leave state governments without responsibilities.
Section 3(4) casts an obligation on the state governments to ensure provident fund; employment injury benefit; housing; educational schemes for children; skill upgrading of workers; funeral assistance; and old age homes. This way, the legislation casts a shared responsibility on the centre and states to introduce welfare schemes for the betterment of people engaged in unorganized sectors.
However, Section 10(3) provides “Every unorganised worker shall be registered and issued an identity card by the District Administration which shall be a smart card carrying a unique identification number and shall be portable.” Regrettably enough, India is yet to see a centralized database even after 12 years after the enactment of the Act, 2008.  The legislation is yet to fulfil its aims and objectives. It appears like a flower without fragrance. The government of India has had an opportunity to register the unorganized workers and realize the goals of this legislation by providing social welfare schemes to them but the government’s insolence for the daily wagers or migrant workers has been understandable throughout the Coronavirus lockdown period.
Meanwhile, the inter-state migrant workmen (Regulation of employment and conditions of service) Act, 1979, which features as many as 36 sections, aims to regulate the employment of inter-State migrant workmen and to provide for their conditions of service and for matters connected therewith. Section 2 (1)(e) defines who the “inter-state migrant workman” is. It says “inter-State migrant workman” means any person who is recruited by or through a contractor in one State under an agreement or other arrangement for employment in an establishment in another State, whether with or without the knowledge of the principal employer in relation to such establishment.
Section 12 of the Act, 1979 obliges the contractors to issue identity cards to every inter-state migrant workman. The contractors are under an obligation to ensure regular payment of wages, accommodation or ensure suitable conditions of work. Section 15 casts a mandatory duty on the employer/contractor to provide journey allowance of a sum not less than the fare from the place of residence of the inter-State migrant workman in his State to the place of work in the other State both for the outward and return journeys and such workman shall be entitled to payment of wages during the period of such journeys as if he were on duty. Apart from this, Section 12(1)(c) obligates the contractors to pay journey allowance to every migrant worker.
However, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers’ right to work and earn breads for their family members have been compromised due to unprecedented lockdown. Their hard times due to unpaid journey allowance and salaries, penniless situations, hunger or journey for home on foot miles away made national and international headlines. But, the government at the helm grossly failed to take cognizance of this legal mandate and the concerns of migrant workers and daily wagers remain unaddressed.
Talking about legal mandates in Nepal, the Infectious Disease Act, 1964, which is brought into force to impose a nationwide Coronavirus lockdown, provides rights tn the state agency to impose fine of Rs. 100 or punish quarantine breakers with one month of imprisonment or both. It allows the enforcement agency to inspect any area, goods or persons suspected of infectious disease.
But the law does not prescribe duties of the government towards the vulnerable citizens. Neither the law ask the employers to pay allowance, food or financial aid to the workmen during lockdown, nor does the legislation oblige the state to compensate the victims of the infectious diseases or lockdown-deprived work.

Nevertheless, a welfare state deserves to stand with her vulnerable citizens; they cannot be merely treated as taxpayers. The vulnerable citizens and industrial establishments too have to be compensated for the loss caused by natural or manmade disasters.
In these contexts, there is a dire need of enacting a comprehensive law to address the needs and aspirations of people during pandemic situations. The meeting of Legislative Management Committee of Parliament held on April 26 has urged the government of Nepal to amend the (outdated) laws relating to epidemic and disaster management. The Committee has said that Nepal is in warrant of a progressive law to battle the epidemic-like situations. In fact, a law which does not prescribe the rights of the citizens and duties of the state towards their citizen deserves to be amended or substituted with fresh enactments showing a clear roadmap of obligations and civil liberties.
Yet, the Indian experience suffices to conclude that mere enactment is not enough. Political commitment and strong determination to implement the laws in letter and spirit is required.

Soon after the wake of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at Wuhan, the capital and the mostly interconnected city of Hubei Province in China, shockwaves spread all over the world and Nepal didn’t remain unscathed. It will be immature to make a precise rate of downfall on the world economy from now, however, predictions on the unprecedented shrinkage of economic activity are certain. Due to the pandemic, Nepalis are facing the lockdown since March 24 and major economic activities that bring people into proximity are halted.
Economic ravages are already triggered by the shutdown of factories, agriculture farms, tourism, foreign employment, migrant labor sectors along with the threat to health. Our evergreen two pillars of GDP: agriculture and remittance income that share almost 26.98 percent and 52.4 percent, as unveiled by Economic Survey under the Ministry of Finance in May 2019 are already crashing and its backbone, our rural economy, is under attack.
According to the recent reports, around 80% of the Nepali populace remain in rural areas where the main sources of income are agriculture and remittance. This is clearly understood when thousands fled the capital and major cities for villages during the time of crises: the 2015 earthquake, the consequent blockade imposed by India and now the COVID-19. Some days ago, news broke in national news portals when some migrant workers swam across the Mahakali River from India to enter Nepal and many of them are still stranded on the border for several days.
Meanwhile, Facebook was photobombed with another exodus of hundreds of people walking past the hilly district from Solukhumbu to Kailai and even to Karnali provinces as they had no time to return home before the lockdown. Just as lower-middle-income migrant workers, who live by daily wages are hit, farmers are in fragile condition. As the contagion continues to rage on, farmers are not being able to move to the local markets while the supply chain faces interruption.
The poultry industry is already facing a death blow due to the irregularities in feed supply and labor shortages. Although the cases of the pandemic topped over 1.5 million globally, luckily Nepal has just witnessed 82 cases with 0 casualties and 16 recoveries as of May 5, 2020. But this doesn’t let us be complacent. Kathmandu in particular is vulnerable while the porous border with India has further added a set of challenges on the plains area.
The state indeed learned lessons from the series of previous outbreaks seen throughout the world: Ebola (2013), mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia in the African region, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (2012), Swine flu (2009), Bird flu (2003), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, shortly SARS (2002) but fortunately Nepal recorded little to no cases at all. When around 8000 people were infected with SARS in 2002-2003, only 800 people died of the disease, while we received none.
Back in 2003, our economy was approximately four times smaller than today’s and we had fewer connections with those affected regions both in terms of commerce and mobility. This speculation might also be taken as a piece of evidence now since the United States and European countries have been the hotspots of the contagion as there is more interconnectivity among the economies and more profound is the mobility of the people. Those epidemics had, of course, little to do with our rural economy of then.
While the government is ramping up task bodies to contain the contagion despite the poorly equipped hospitals and little testing capacity within limited resources, Nepalis are worried somehow. What if the cases escalate? What if the rural populace gets infected? Can we fend off the virus and recoup our economy?

Even before the pandemic broke out, in the fiscal year 2018/19, the share of the agriculture sector on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrank by 0.61 percent than the previous which clearly shows the possible hamper in predicted economic growth rate by 7 percent at producer price. Thankfully the favorable weather ensured the good production of bumper crops: rice and many other staples, coupled with the income from the remittance last year. But the situation is worse now as both sectors are at risk.
Not only being concerned with the health of farmers but also with a distraught face, the minister for Agriculture and Livestock Development Ghanshyam Bhusal had foreseen the possible famine due to the deadlock on agricultural activities brought by the coronavirus crisis. He also warned all the 753 local governments of the misfortunes and asked to come up with a firm plan to fight the deadly virus and initiate breakthrough actions on his signature stewardship “protected agriculture-assured savings”. Since the return of many foreign employees, there is a possibility of competition in employment markets and subsequent crisis will not be easy to handle. 
At present, two interventions seem plausible. First, farmers need to remain connected to the market, whether local or national. But they should be mindful of the increased personal protective equipment, safety measures and safe collective farm practices with social distancing. The local government should show high alertness on testing the suspected cases and making farmers safe in the field. This will stabilize the income sources for farmers and prioritize the continuity of food production. In the meantime, this will stabilize the purchasing power of lower-income consumers that would otherwise be impaired with hiking prices provoked due to trade restrictions on agricultural commodities.
Second, there is a need to restore income sources of migrant workers and support cottage industries in rural areas. Identifying the workers and temporary settlement by the federal government should be on high priority. Equally, it is high time that digital interventions are done at a rapid pace. These interventions should be incorporated into rural communities in the form of farmers’ friendly tools, making less contact with the people, getting access to online purchases and technical consultations. Local governments should gear up to manage marketing channels.
Today, about 63 percent of the total population of 29.6 million is between 15-60 yrs., Nepal has the largest proportion of the workforce than ever before in history. The post-pandemic economic landscape hence depends on addressing their positions. This pandemic no surprisingly is exposing the negative outlook of our economy with unfolding challenges over time. Nevertheless, it is an opportunity to rethink the path of economic growth and shape the future of our nation. This has urged us to revive the rural economy.

Today countries around the world are facing unprecedented and prolonged threat of Covid-19 pandemic resulting in huge number of deaths, loss of economy and disruption of day to day life and order. Furthermore, there is neither any certainty about the state or fate of respective countries and the global order in post-Corona days nor any guarantee of the return of normal life and the processes of recovery.
The countries and the world order as well would not be the same again as before by the time the war against Covid-19 comes to an end. This will inspire humankind to focus on earliest discoveries, remedies and preparedness to combat such or any calamity likely to crop up in the future.
Although appearing for the first time in the city of Wuhan, China, in December last year, it has really been a big surprise in itself how within a short period the virus has managed to massively spread to developed Western countries. Accordingly, Italy, Spain, Great Britain, and France are the most victimized countries in the first phase after China.
At present, unfortunately, the United States of America has been on the top of the list as the utmost affected country among the sufferers. The US death toll astonishingly is in high number. This is from every angle a very big tragedy indeed.  It is still uncertain from where and when the virus horrors are completely extinct and controlled.
In South Asia, countries like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have seen Corona infected cases. It has been traced in thousands, yet it is consoling to see that the loss altogether has been low.
In India, the pandemic spread more or less to almost all parts of the vast country yet declared deaths are limited. The credit to this should largely go to the government’s timely call for lockdown and the obedience of the public in high spirit. The people realized the lockdown’s worth for their own security above all.  It highlights how timely precautionary measures like social distancing and lockdown   prove extraordinarily effective in such cases.
So far we have been fortunate that in spite of poor healthcare system and testing facilities in the country, there have not been any corona deaths so far. In our case too, it is apparent how the government’s timely call for alertness, social distancing and lockdown has helped us also all together in reducing human and other casualties.
However, the fact that there has not been a single death in our country so far should not make us complacent. After all, World Health Organization (WHO) and other reputable global health organizations have warned that the probability of the resurgence of virus infections may occur in the future.
Strict application of lockdown experiences in the past few weeks have shown how our open and porous border, particularly with India, has caused a problem requiring very careful handling. Because, as everybody knows, it’s where the flow of people is huge.

Both countries should be alert about other disturbances in the border during this pandemic period. Any disturbances in the border means that there would be obstruction in huge flow of supplies from India to cater to our day to day needs.
Some scenarios unfolding in the country, however, are worrying. The likely reduction of remittances from migrant laborers that has been so far propping up our economy needs to be get immediate attention. Obstruction in physical infrastructure works, huge damages to the tourism sector and loss of employment all are recipes for disaster. It is expected that the government will take a lead in chalking out a fresh post-corona reconstruction plan and implement it earnestly.
However, instead of uniting and fighting this global pandemic, the country has seen political instability and disputes within the ruling party. Thankfully, internal disputes and tussles in the ruling party has been resolved. Now the whole focus should be on combating COVID-19.

Itahari, 9 May (2020) – NTV Itahari has scheduled to telecast its first ever sign language news from May 14.  According to Tanka Uprety, the chair of the channel, the evening prime time news of 7 PM will be broadcasted in Nepali sign language.
”We have already started to advertise about our pioneering sign language news from our office at Itahari”, informed Uprety.  Uprety said it would be the first sign language news outside federal capital not only in Nepal Television fraternity including 5 channels but also among all other privately owned television channels.
According to Uprety, Santoshi Ghimire, who works as official interpreter of Koshi Deaf Association of Biratnagar, will facilitate the sign language news.  Ghimire said it was her immense pleasure to be a part of first sign language news in the state.
The pioneering news broadcasting is supported by Social Development Ministry of State 1. Social Development Minister Jiwan Ghimire has reportedly said his ministry did so to address genuine demands of deaf community of the state.
The Itahari-based state broadcaster has given visible optimism among deaf members of the state. ”We were campaigning for sign language since long. However, we were not successful”, said Ojha. He added, ”NTV Itahari has heed our pleas.”
Previously, NTV Itahari had used first sign language interpreter for the television address of Chief Minister Sherdhan Rai on the new Nepali Year of 2077 BS on April. In his official televised address at 8:15 am from NTV Itahari Channel, Rai came up with sign language interpreter Santoshi Ghimire.
”There were talks about sign language news broadcasting in our state. Social Development Ministry of Biratnagar had given nod to start from Makalu Television”, shared Ghimire. She added, ”NTV Itahari, the largest television broadcaster from state one, has also shown eagerness which is praiseworthy news for deaf community”.
Sitaram Ojha, President of Deaf Federation of State One said he was elated with the initiation. ”Our constitution has guaranteed access of all state information to deaf communities”, remarked Ojha, ”This must be replicated by all local and provincial governments.” Ojha praised daily COVID-19 briefing with sign language interpreter by federal government.
”Based on latest census of 2011, Nepal has a total of 513,221 people with disabilities and many of them are deaf”, said Ojha. He continued, ”In order to address the constitutionally guaranteed rights of this community, sign language is necessary.” RSS

As the worldwide death toll from COVID-19 mounts, an important argument that unfolds, of late, is about enacting a comprehensive code to deal with all issues connected with the pandemic.
The lockdown and quarantine measures have been crucial to contain the spread of the deadly virus. But the mere presence of quarantine laws is not the end of story. The nationwide lockdown, which is in place since March 24 in Nepal, to prevent the spread of virus has rendered several unskilled labourers and daily wage labourers jobless. The epidemic laws in India and Nepal offer rights to the government machineries to restrict the movement of the people, goods, services or modes of transport.
Nevertheless, the legal regimes fail to lay down the duties of the government. An employee or daily wage earner is neither entitled to receive payments by way of compensation for loss of earnings, nor can migrant workers or stranded persons claim foodstuffs as a matter of right under the current scheme of law. A victim of COVID-19 cannot claim compensation from the state in India or Nepal.
Still, Article 36 of the Constitution of Nepal provides right on every citizen to be protected from a state of starvation, resulting from lack of foodstuffs. However, in England, a victim of the deadly virus is entitled to claim compensation from the government under the scheme of the Coronavirus Act, 2020.
Along these lines, it bears relevance to acknowledge the greeting message of the Chief Justice of Nepal Cholendra SJB Rana that was issued on the eve of Law Day on May 8. The Chief Justice has underscored the need of evolving a pandemic jurisprudence to address the concerns of people during health emergency-like situations. In fact, a pandemic leaves its impact for a long time until a vaccine arrives. In case of current COVID-19 outbreak, countries across the globe are suffering from financial crisis due to quarantine laws and lockdown measures put in place (to curb the transmission of the virus). The daily wagers and people working in unorganized sectors walked home to escape hunger and insecurity. In India, millions of poor and needy citizens were reportedly seen heading to villages on foot in absence of public transport.
Unfortunately, many have lost their jobs and many others are at the verge of losing the employment due to COVID-19 pandemic. The International Labour Organization (ILO) in its latest report said, “No matter where in the world or in which sector, the crisis is having a dramatic impact on the world’s workforce.” It further said, in absence of appropriate policy measures, workers face high risk of falling into poverty and will experience greater challenges in regaining their livelihoods during the recovery period. Almost 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide as a result of COVID-19.
This would lead to suspension of fundamental rights relating to employment, work and trade and commerce. Right to work has been recognized by the internationally binding instruments. Article 23 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948 envisages that everyone has the right to work, free choice of employment, just and favourable conditions of work and protection against unemployment. This provision not only protects the right to work, but also obligates states to provide the right to compensation while unemployed. Article 6 of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), 1966 is also worded in almost similar terms. Under current legal regime in India and Nepal, an employee, unorganized worker or daily wager is not entitled to invoke writ jurisdiction to seek compensation at the instance of loss of earning due to natural or manmade disaster.
In these contexts, India and Nepal need to think of a clear, unambiguous and well-articulated plans and policies on what should be done during pandemic or health emergency-like situations in future. The republics have stringent penal provisions to deal with infectious diseases. For instance, Section 104 of Country Criminal Code, 2074 (BS) which envisages for up to 10 years of jail sentence and a fine of up to 100,000/- against a person who intentionally spreads or cause to spread infectious diseases.
The provision also allows the judicial department to impose jail sentence of up to five years and fine of up to 50,000/-on a reckless person and up to three years of imprisonment and a fine of up to 30,000/- on negligent ones who indulges in spreading the infectious diseases. But, the mere stringent penal provision cannot succeed to address entire dynamics associated with pandemics. A welfare state deserves to promulgate a law that lays down a mandatory duty of the state instruments towards the vulnerable citizens and victims of infectious diseases during outbreak of pandemic.
The governments should be more liberal about allocating budgets to rescue the vulnerable population facing poverty due to loss of earning. The dissenting voices in public spaces are enough to conclude that government’s support have not been enough or their policies failed to intervene much. India introduced an ordinance to address the grievances of doctors.
The Indian Medical Association on April 20 said that it would observe a ‘Black Day’ on April 23 if the government does not adopt a central law on violence against healthcare workers. In its response, the Narendra Modi government on April 22 brought an ordinance (to amend Epidemic Act, 1897) that makes attack on doctors, paramedics or nurses a non-bailable and cognizable offence punishable from six months to up to seven years in prison and fine of up to Rs 500,000/-. This law envisages that the police shall investigate the case within 30 days and the case shall be fast tracked with the final judgment to come within a year. Also, the persons found vandalizing the private clinic or a car belonging to a doctor will be asked to pay twice. Notably, several healthcare workers in India have been attacked at different locations as they battle to stop the spread of Coronavirus. Still, the ordinance may become ineffective after the pandemic is declared over. The government at the helm should assure that those who attack healthcare workers would be dealt strictly in future too.
 

Take the example of England here.  The Coronavirus Act, 2020 casts an obligation on the state to increase the manpower in health and social care sectors. Sections 2-7 and their incidental Schedules provide for the emergency temporary registration of various regulated healthcare professionals and social workers for the duration of the emergency. Sections 11 to 13 of the Act provide indemnity against clinical negligence claims for healthcare professionals assisting in the response to the outbreak, who would not otherwise be so indemnified. Section 9 makes arrangement for the compensation to emergency volunteers who may have incurred loss of earnings or for travel and subsistence. Its a comprehensive legislation addressing the issues connected with COVID-19 including emergency registration of healthcare professionals, temporary suspension of schools and colleges, court proceedings through audio-visual, power to restrict gatherings or compensate the industries facing loss due to outbreak and quarantine measures in force.
This legal arrangement gives a message that there should be coherence between rights of the citizens and duties of the government towards her subjects in a welfare state.
These unprecedented circumstances call for the development of a pandemic jurisprudence that would lay down strong and vibrant legislative leadership; coordination and cooperation between centre and provinces; and proactive policy to authorize the government to revive economy, education, and healthcare sectors. After all, lack of requisite diligence and responsiveness of the government in expediting welfare functions cannot be tolerated in welfare states. There is a dire need of evolving a pandemic jurisprudence to strike a balance between the rights of the persons—natural and juristic persons—and duties of the state during an outbreak. It’s high time to understand that extraordinary measures must be adopted to address extraordinary situations.

http://english.lokaantar.com/articles/big-data-scientific-paradigms/,"Sudeep Adhikari

Jim Gray, a renowned American computer scientist, has sub-divided the history of scientific exploration into four different distinct paradigms: Empirical (for instance, ancient Greek and Indian astronomy), Theoretical (Newtonian mechanics, Quantum and Relativistic mechanics etc), Computational (simulation of complex phenomena not amenable to analytical tools) and Data Exploration (unification of experiment, theory and simulation). Data-intensive science based on data exploration, according to Jim Gray, characterizes current scientific paradigm. With the vast amount of data at our disposal that have resulted from experiments, simulations and analytical studies in the past, according to Gray, “information velocity” of scientific studies can be significantly accentuated if they are made available online allowing their inter-operation.
It won’t be wrong to admit that complex systems such as biosphere, economy, society and consciousness may not be comprehended in their mind-boggling totality within the premise of our current scientific methodology, which is further shaped by our intrinsic linear, causal and reductionistic outlook. So is the fourth paradigm, that is, data exploration our foray into the newest scientific paradigm? I would not consider this picture very optimistic because data-intensive studies are very obviously guided by brute statistical approaches. I am also not sure if this approach is scientific in a definitive sense. Chris Anderson, however, in his thought provoking article titled “The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete” in Wired (2008) argued how the conventional scientific methodology, which is based on building “testable hypotheses which can be further experimentally confirmed or falsified” is fast becoming obsolete. According to Anderson, big-data is not a just a lot of data, it is a different ontology in itself. Data without model may be just noise, but with big data at the disposal, he stated rather arrogantly: correlation supersedes causation, and science can advance even without coherent models, unified theories, or really any mechanistic explanation at all. I would still admit that this is very much debatable, but leaving aside issues pertaining to deeper scientific values of “understanding how nature works” for a while, may be this is the only practical way to make meaningful and pragmatic inferences while dealing with complex systems. As put forth by Peter Norvig, Google’s research director: all models are wrong, and increasingly you can succeed without them. What a time to be alive!
A whopping one-third of Amazon’s purchase comes from algorithmically generated recommendations on their webpage. Wal-Mart’s algorithm similarly found that when people are preparing for massive storms, they tend to desperately buy strawberry pop-tarts. This is not because Amazon’s and Wal-Mart’s algorithms have  better understanding of human-psychology to nudge them into buying crazy things; it  is just the shape of big-data discovered by their statistical algorithms.  While I personally have big reservation against treating such studies as belonging to the realm of science, their efficacy in terms of immense practicality to deal with complex systems can’t be under-estimated.
As discussed in the essay titled “The Emerging Science of Environmental Applications” by Jeff Dozier (University of California, Santa Barbara) and William B. Gail (Microsoft), data-intensive fourth paradigm is not a science in the traditional sense, that is question driven and guided by first principle, but a discipline which is more aimed at enabling us to seek practical courses of action. As further elaborated by the authors, “useful even when incomplete” is another primary signature of such an approach. This seems to be more relevant in the case of complex issue such as climate change, where despite the current state of our knowledge being fragmentary, there is an urgent need for us to make quick but useful inferences for the overall good of Earth and the whole humanity. Seeing that way, the fourth scientific paradigm is not based on the way we do science in  traditional sense, but its relevance lies in the application of vast amount of data at our disposal to make practical and actionable plans.
As similarly discussed by John R. Delaney (University of Washington) and Roger S. Barga (Microsoft), Earth’s ocean-system is the largest as well as the most complex biome which dynamics is still poorly known. The fourth paradigm is here most relevant because we may not be able to know the ocean-system at its totality, but what it can ensure is the availability of necessary information to make informed decisions of very immediate practical nature through massive data storage, cloud computing, scientific workflow, advanced graphics and handheld supercomputing.

One of the striking examples of the application of big-data paradigm in the realm of pure science is the discovery of Higgs Boson in 2012. The amount of data collected during the collision in the massive detectors of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is so large that it took two complete years (2010 to 2012) to organize them before making the historic announcement. In contrast to traditional scientific paradigm, existence of Higgs Boson was conferred, not as an objective fact, but solely based on the shape of big-data that flowed profusely from LHC. Not only for the pragmatic comprehension of complex systems, may big-data also have a role to play to deal with vastly complicated experimental events. How is that for the fourth paradigm of scientific exploration?
I am not going to discount the immense practicality of fourth paradigm and its pivotal role for enabling us to make informed decisions, particularly while dealing with complex systems such as environment and economics. But at the meantime, it is an urgent duty of philosophy of science to demarcate if this paradigm is really a science in proper sense before we regress helplessly into a newer form of reductionistic dogmatism, with atoms replaced by bits. Is not there an eerily similar undercurrent of arrogance between Laplace’s I had no need of that hypothesis when asked by Napoleon about the role of God in his celestial mechanics and Peter Norvig’s conviction that google doesn’t need models to succeed?

Randhir Chaudhary

Along with the transmission rate of Covid-19 expanding in Nepal, political and diplomatic absurdity of Nepalese politicians is also on the rise. Consequently, neither is the fight with catastrophic Covid-19 being done properly nor is politics getting any shape as per the need.  In last couple of weeks the KP Sharma Oli cabinet has shown its immaturity by extending the lockdown meaninglessly. Neither in Kathmandu nor elsewhere the lockdown is seen as a pragmatic move.
Oli cabinet passed the decision to reopen 44 industries but it has been proven to be an immature decision. When the number of the infected of Covid-19 increased due to the rapid testing the government had to take back its decision. It shows that the government must expedite the testing seriously rather than taking baseless decisions.
During the pandemic, the nation witnessed the capacity of the government in dealing with geopolitics and with domestic political affairs. It was with a myopic decision that Oli government brought two ordinances and invited political imbalance in Nepal. It’s well established that the ordinance managed to unhinge Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and the party is sensing aftershocks which has been impacting Nepalese polity subsequently.
Shedding light upon the dramatic developments, let’s see events unfolding categorically. The dire consequences of ordinance hammered the base of the NCP and started a debate to dethrone KP Sharma Oli alleging him of being autocratic. His own party leaders blamed him that he is not capable enough to drive the nation so far. Discourse heightened to a level that NCP leaders started finding an alternative face for the PM. Topping it all, the NCP was on the verge of splitting.
Amidst these ups and downs, the kinetic movement of Ambassador of China to Nepal, Hou Yanqi was meaningful. Hou held a series of meetings with senior leaders of the NCP expressing concern over power game within the ruling party. She managed to stop the NCP from dethroning Oli and the splitting of the party for a while. However, the unrest within the party still has not vaporized. This aggressive activeness of Chinese Ambassador portrays long neck of dragon in the domestic affairs of Nepal.
For the last few years China is being assertive in Nepal. Nepal has been unnecessarily emboldening the Chinese to act the way they like. To corroborate this very fact, attack on a Nepali police last week would suffice. Indeed, only few Chinese nationals while demonstrating for the safe passage back homes scuffled with Nepal Police in Kathmandu. They physically attacked Nepal Police and injured one of the senior officers. What sort of psyche is encouraging the Chinese to flex their muscles in Nepal?
Another alarming act of China must make us worried- the installation of Gigabyte optical fibre network at the altitude of 6,500 meters. On April 30, China Mobile and Huawei jointly took 5G connectivity to a new height by bringing the network to the summit of Mount Everest. It’s surprising why Nepal shows its blind love towards China?
Upgrading and enhancing communication system in Nepal is a must. But the question arises, Oli government vehemently obstructed CG Communication (CG Telecom) whereas CG Telecom would have proven a boon in the field of communication in Nepal. Meantime, Nepal lays down red carpets to China to expand its projects the way the dragon wishes.
Prior to allowing Huawei to install its network devices at the Mount Everest, Nepal government should have thought that Nepal is a vital strategic location for many of the countries throughout globe. In the name of measuring the Mount Everest, one can easily speculate that China has ill intention to keep the southern part of Nepal bordering to India under scrutiny.
Egregiously, on May 2, China Global Television Network (CGTN), the government television, tweeted that Mount Quomolungma, also known as Mount Everest, the world’s highest peak is located in China’s Tibet Autonomous Region. Though the tweet has been deleted, it has raised a serious concern. China has deliberately floated a discourse to know the level of objection Nepal can make. In the long run, China would be more vocal in claiming that Everest lies in their territory.
Nepal is geopolitically sensitive country. Not only the immediate neighbors India and China but the US and western powers have grave concern regarding Nepal’s location.

Few days ago India’s Minister of Defence Rajnath Singh inaugurated the 80 kilometer Lipulekh road which will serve as the shortest route between New Delhi and Kailash-Mansarovar, a revered Hindu pilgrimage site in the Tibetan plateau. This was a historically disputed issue between Nepal and India.
India should have been sensitive towards the timing of the inauguration. However, the unnecessary ‘moves’ of China in Nepal would have catalyzed India for the inauguration amidst the pandemic. Over the issue of Lipulekh, the way PM KP Oli is reacting as if he doesn’t know anything is shameful. His cabinet minister is aware of all the development but PM doesn’t know anything! India boldly clarified its position about the constructed road and asked Nepal to hold discussion after Covid-19 pandemic ends.
It’s high time for Nepal to firstly manage the swift transmission of Covid-19 as the number of the infected is alarmingly growing. Secondly, Nepal, due to its immature government, is being trapped in geopolitical maneuvers. Blind love for China would lead Nepal nowhere.

Itahari, 13 May (2020) – Bhulke area of Udayapur district was first venue to find COVID-19 patients in state-1. On April 17, 12 people tested positive at this area located at Triyuga Municipality Ward Number 3 maing it the immediate epicenter of COVID-19 in the stae.  The first batch of the global pandemic patients have been recovered. For those recovered and quarantined, local government has turned to Aryudedic medicine.
‘We are collaborating with All Nepal Homeopathic Association and also with the Gaighat Ayurvedic Hospital of our district to boost immunity power of locals”, shared Baldev Chaudhary, the mayor of the Triyuga Municipality. He added, ”According to experts’ advice we will administer the alternative and ancient medicines of Ayurdedic produts to all locals.”
Chaudhary said Social Development Ministry of State-1 supported to this endeavor.
The ayurvedic and the alternative medicines would be administered to all 25 people quarantined at Janata Multiple Campus of Bhulke and all other locals of 400 households, informed mayor Chaudhary. He said, ” We got required stoke of medicine for continued consumption for three days and we are administrating these medicine by tomorrow in presence of ayurvedic doctors.”  Mayor Chaudhary said around 1400 locals would be administrated the ancient indigenous medicine with latest research and practices.
Arurvedic doctor at the Social Development Ministry of State-1 reportedly said the ministry has made adequate protocol for the use of Ayurvedic medicines.  Dr. Bishal said alternative medicines would boost the required immunity of the people. He said, ”This medicine doesn’t create any side effects.” RSS

Doha, 30 June (2020) – Upon the directives of HH the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, HE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani announced a new pledge of the State of Qatar to provide USD 100 million to alleviate the human suffering of by the Syrian people.
In a speech at Brussels IV Conference on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region, held via video conferencing, HE the Foreign Minister underscored that the new pledge comes from the firm belief of the State of Qatar to fulfill its international and humanitarian obligation towards the brotherly Syrian people, pointing out that the actual State of Qatar’s assistance to the brotherly Syrian people has exceeded USD 2 billion.
The State of Qatar – in compliance with its humanitarian and moral responsibilities – has spared no effort, since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, to enhance the rapid humanitarian response and provide effective assistance to the brotherly Syrian people, he said.
HE the Foreign Minister affirmed the steadfast support of the State of Qatar to the international efforts aimed at reaching a political solution to the Syrian crisis based on first Geneva Declaration of 2012 and the relevant Security Council resolutions, especially Resolution No. 2254, and in a way that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people in security, stability, and the preservation of its territorial integrity.
At the beginning of his speech, HE Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani thanked the European Union and the United Nations for the invitation to hold this conference and praised the participating countries for their estimated efforts to support the brotherly Syrian people despite the economic difficulties faced by all countries due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
He added that the world is facing a humanitarian crisis that humanity has not known before, during which the Syrian people were deprived of the most basic necessities of living such as water, food, infrastructure, and basic social services such as education and health, in addition to the number of displaced people, that reached 12 million people.
HE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the success in facing of the catastrophic and grave humanitarian repercussions of the Syrian crisis will only come through finding a political solution that radically ends this crisis, and this is the responsibility of the international community, especially the Security Council and the actors concerned.
HE the Foreign Minister asked, what kind of generation do we expect to result from the Syrian war as the children of Syria have grown up watching the pictures of artillery, bombings, and massacres with internationally prohibited weapons that have often affected their cities, villages, and families?
The time has come for the international community to work hard to stop the killing machine of the Syrian regime and put an end to its increasing violence, which is no difference between it and violent extremism and terrorism, which reinforce each other and converge in existence, goal, and outcome, HE the Minister explained.
At the end of his speech, HE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs reiterated thanks and appreciation to all countries that have pledged and fulfilled their obligations towards the Syrian people and valued the efforts of the United Nations and the European Union to organize this conference, expressing the hope that the desired results will be achieved.

After facing several allegations of corruption and feeble handling of COVID-19 crisis across the political spectrum, the KP Sharma Oli government of Nepal Communist Party (NCP) has tried its best to deviate people’s and opposition’s mind.
However, the pain faced by ordinary Nepali people is not easy to dilute as Oli government thinks. The opposition party Nepali Congress (NC) would leave no stone unturned to unmask the mal-governance being served by the Oli government. We, as congress leaders, will always be with the government on the issues related with national interest like in the issue of amendment of the Constitution to update the political map and national emblem in the Constitution of Nepal.
We would now raise the question about the status of dispute with India regarding Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani. Nepali people want the land back as soon as possible. But Nepali people suspect the government’s political and diplomatic capacity to get it done.
In the above-mentioned scenario, this write-up will discuss about the real politics and roadmap of the NCP. For that it’s necessary to keep in mind the recent scuffle within the NCP where Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is being blatantly criticized by his own leaders and even by intellectuals from outside the party. As an opposition leader, I must pen this issue to make ordinary people clear about the hypocrisy of PM Oli.
Few days back during the birth anniversary of late leader Madan Bhandari, PM Oli said that “designs are being hatched to topple me down from the position of PM for releasing the new map which was adopted through the parliament. Intellectual discussions, media stories coming out from New Delhi, embassy’s activities and meetings of different hotels in Kathmandu, it’s clear enough to understand how people are active to dethrone me. But they will not succeed”.
Such immature and irresponsible statement from the PM is deplorable. It seems that PM Oli knows everything being plotted inside Nepal by any embassy. If it is the case, how can the leader of almost two thirds majority government remain mute witness to such conspiracy being hatched inside Nepal? More importantly, this statement from PM Oli is natural to him because the foundation of communists in Nepal lies in anti-Indian narrative. Even during the last elections, NCP secured massive victory by abusing India.
If the Embassy of India has hatched any conspiracy against him, PM Oli needs to prove it with evidence otherwise he has no moral right to hold the position of the PM. Moreover, in the meeting of NCP’s standing committee meeting Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ pointed out at Oli’s statement as baseless. He said, ‘It was not India but I had been seeking your resignation from both party chair and prime minister.’ Prachanda, along with other senior leaders of the NCP, criticized Oli’s statement saying that it will damage the relationship with India.
Nepal is being pulled into deep ditch due to the bad politics of the NCP. PM KP Oli is mishandling the country’s geopolitics merely to cling to his post by projecting Nepal’s immediate neighbour India an enemy.
Pondering upon the political steps taken by the communist PM Oli, I remember Adolf Hitler’s ‘strategy of propaganda’. Hitler is perceived as the super-propagandist of his era. Doubt, division and fear were the ‘soft but lethal weapons’ of Hitler to endure his autocracy and self-centric politics. His purpose can be summed up in his own phrase—to sow “mental confusion, contradiction of feeling, indecision, and panic”.

Having no pro-people agenda and facing allegations of several scams and the poor handling of COVID-19, Oli is trying his best to keep people confused and deviate from the core issues by playing anti-Indian cards. Nepal used to be and still is capable enough to deal with geopolitics on her own. But it’s the trend of communist parties to imbalance geopolitics whenever they are in power.
Nepali people would not tolerate any more of NCP’s ‘dirty politics’. We Nepali nationals are patriotic by nature and our feelings cannot be muddied by ultra-nationalism. The way NCP is creating the unwanted gulf between Nepal and India would be challenging to bridge. Nepal believes in knitting geopolitical relationship on the theory of ‘equilibrium’, rather than appeasing one while hating the other neighbour.
The way NCP and Communist Party of China held political meeting the other day is shameful. I wonder whether this time again the Chinese Ambassador will manage NCP’s intra-party dispute. Whatsoever, all the activities of Oli government are under surveillance of Nepali people.

PM KP Sharma Oli has dropped a diplomatic bombshell on Sunday whose repercussions the country will feel for a long time.
Speaking at a programme commemorating the birth of influential communist leader late Madan Bhandari at PM’s official residence Baluwatar, Oli said that plots have been hatched in India to topple him. He said, “We published an official map incorporating our territories. We even made the map constitutional. An environment has been created to push the narrative that the PM is about to be changed in a week or a fortnight. You may have heard the debates in India. That country’s state mechanism is unusually active. There are many activities in hotels in Nepal. The embassy is very active here.”
Thus, Oli has directly accused India of trying to depose him. He even gave the example in recent history when he was replaced by Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” after he managed to ink trade and transit deal with China following the Indian blockade during his first tenure as the PM.
It is an open secret that India engineers regime change in Nepal (remember India’s Former President Pranab Mukherjee’s interview on Aljazeera). But an incumbent prime minister explicitly claiming the fact is unprecedented in Nepal’s history. This statement will further worsen the relationship between two countries that has become frosty after India inaugurated a link road at Lipulekh which falls in Nepal’s territory.
Oli’s statement should be understood in the context of bitter infighting within his party NCP. Because of Oli’s arrogant and inflexible attitude mixed with utter mismanagement, the ruling party has been drawing flak across the political spectrum. There were preparations of ousting Oli from the post before coronavirus pandemic hit the country. But he was able to defeat the efforts of his rivals with one after another strategy.
Feeling that he had been cornered, Oli first threw the health card. He went to have kidney re-transplantation and was able to delay the secretariat meeting. After regaining health, pandemic turned out to be a good pretext for him to lengthen his tenure. But his government proved to be an utter failure in properly managing pandemic response. Then he threw the card of ordinances to facilitate splitting of parties. But that too backfired and he had to withdraw these ordinances.
Thus, Oli has been throwing everything at the rivals and the latter have scrambled to prepare counter-strategies. He floated the names of Bamdev Gautam and Madhav Kumar Nepal as his successor only to ditch them later. The map came as another strategy for Oli to cling to his post. He was able to burnish his nationalist credentials and also manage to stir people’s emotions.
But rival factions in the NCP have seen through this emotive move and have been asking the PM to resign from his post. Not willing to face the rivals, Oli had been providing different explanations to be absent from the Standing Committee meetings. He attended one of the meetings in which Prachanda and former PM Madhav Kumar Nepal criticized him for his failure in running the government and the party. To teach them a lesson, he has now thrown another “nationalist” card by pointing out Indian efforts in toppling him. By implication, he is trying to paint his rivals as Indian agents.
Dragging another country to suppress intra-party struggle sets a dangerous precedence and ultimately harms the interest of the country.
But dragging another country to suppress intra-party struggle sets a dangerous precedence and ultimately harms the interest of the country. If indeed plots have been hatched against him in the Indian embassy, he should summon up the Indian ambassador and ask for a clarification. But his statement is for public consumption and is one of the tactics to deflect attention from the utter mismanagement of the government which has put party in a tight spot.
Through this controversial statement, Oli has managed to further alienate India. At a time when India is hurting from a bitter border dispute with China, it does not suit Nepal well to put salt on its wounds.
Lack of dialogue with India after the constitutional amendment is worrying. The government should not think that it has done its duty by issuing the map. There should be a sincere effort to have diplomatic dialogue with India to remove that country’s troops from Kalapani. However, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pradeep Kumar Gyawali seems to have raised his hands in surrender by saying that India is not willing to sit for talks.
Now that Oli has damagingly excoriated India, that country will hesitate to initiate dialogue with Nepal. But surprisingly India has not taken any substantive action against Nepal post-fracas. If we look from the Indian side, Nepal has staked its claim (rightful, of course) on the lands that India has been using for the last 60 years and even incorporated them in Nepal’s political map. In India’s eyes, this is an attack on Indian sovereignty. But India has not done anything formally besides issuing statements.
Is it because it has learnt its lessons from the ill-advised blockade in 2015? Or is it refraining from opening a salvo against Nepal at a time when it is engaged in border dispute with China? Are there other powers who have asked India not to take any action against Nepal? How much is China involved in Nepal to act as a shield against Indian aggression? There are no easy answers to these questions.

Nonetheless, Oli’s misadventures in matters diplomatic will cause an irreparable harm to the country. It appears that Oli may have been bold enough to irk India because he gets unwavering support from China. Chinese Ambassador Hou Yanqi made hectic parleys with incumbent party leaders when it seemed that Oli was about to be ousted. But we cannot say for sure that China will keep propping up Oli given its treacherous history vis-a-vis Nepal (remember the lack of meaningful support during Anglo-Nepal War and even during Indian blockades).
The scribe believes that Oli may have been emboldened to poke into India’s nose with the support of the Americans who want to make Nepal a geopolitical playground to check the rise of both China and India. That must be the reason why Oli is all for bringing Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in Nepal despite bitter opposition within his party.
But the level of animosity against MCC in the country seems to have taken away Oli’s American prop. Oli’s rival Prachanda in a virtual workshop programme with Communist Party of China this month said that Nepal will not accept any programme which is under US’s military alliance. Leaders like Bhim Rawal and Jhala Nath Khanal too have been against the MCC saying that it is a part of US’s Indo-Pacific Strategy which aims to contain China. It is difficult for the much vilified MCC to get parliamentary ratification. One can be certain that rejecting MCC will estrange Nepal from the west.
Given this scenario, Oli and NCP appear to be steering the country to a ditch. Alienating democratic countries like India and the US and embracing authoritarian China with its barely credible history of support will spell disaster to the country which is not self-reliant. Misusing international relations to score a victory in domestic politics does not herald a bright future.

Doha, 27 June (2020) – In a statement issued by the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property (SAIP) on 23 June 2020, Saudi Arabia makes a number of blatantly false assertions about the findings of the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Panel Report concerning the dispute Saudi Arabia – Measures concerning the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights (DS567).
These false assertions are regrettably part of an orchestrated attempt by Saudi Arabia to spread disinformation and obscure the truth about the WTO Panel’s findings.
Yet again, Saudi Arabia has reverted to tactics of deception and deceit tactics, rather than taking the necessary corrective action to combat intellectual property theft.
Fortunately, the Report, which includes a clear statement of the Panel’s conclusions, is publicly available for all to see: Saudi Arabia failed to protect intellectual property rights and their deficiencies must be remedied.
To counter the disinformation published by Saudi Arabia, the State of Qatar presents the following true statements: The WTO Panel found that Saudi Arabia’s attempted recourse to the national security exception did not excuse the violation of its obligations under the WTO’s TRIPS Agreement.
In particular, the Panel found that “the non-application of criminal procedures and penalties to beoutQ does not ‘meet a minimum requirement of plausibility in relation to the proffered essential security interests, i.e. that they are not implausible as measures protective of these interests’” (see Panel Report, para. 7.293).
Although the Panel found that one of the prerequisites for invoking the TRIPS national security defense – an “emergency” – was present, this was due to Saudi Arabia’s own conduct, specifically its decision to sever relations with Qatar and its repeated false allegations about “terrorism and extremism”.
The WTO Panel was careful not to endorse Saudi Arabia’s allegations, stating that: “[t]he Panel expresses or implies no position concerning any of these allegations, and recalls that Qatar strongly denied the various accusations made by Saudi Arabia” (see Panel Report, paras. 7.262 and 7.263). Saudi Arabia is the only WTO Member ever to have had its invocation of a national security defense rejected (see Panel Report, paras. 7.294 and 8.1(c)(ii)).
The WTO Panel found no exception to justify Saudi Arabia’s failure to take criminal action against beoutQ (see Panel Report, paras. 7.286 and 7.288).
The WTO Panel found that “Saudi Arabia has taken measures that, directly or indirectly, have had the result of preventing beIN from obtaining Saudi legal counsel to enforce its IP rights through civil enforcement procedures before Saudi courts and tribunals, and thus Saudi Arabia has acted in a manner inconsistent with Article 42 and Article 41.1 of the TRIPS Agreement” (Panel Report, para. 8.1(b)(i)).
The WTO Panel found that “Saudi Arabia has not provided for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied to beoutQ despite the evidence establishing prima facie that beoutQ is operated by individuals or entities under the jurisdiction of Saudi Arabia, and thus Saudi Arabia has acted inconsistently with Article 61 of the TRIPS Agreement” (see Panel Report, para. 8.1(b)(i)).
In fact, the WTO Panel found that “while taking no action to apply criminal procedures and penalties to beoutQ, Saudi authorities engaged in the promotion of public gatherings with screenings of beoutQ’s unauthorized broadcasts of 2018 World Cup matches” (see Panel Report, para. 7.219). The WTO Panel found that “beIN and other foreign right holders repeatedly sent detailed information to the Saudi authorities to inform them of beoutQ’s alleged piracy, and the extensive evidentiary basis for concluding that beoutQ is operated by individuals or entities subject to the criminal jurisdiction of Saudi Arabia” (Panel Report, para. 7.219).
The WTO Panel found that this information was sent to the Saudi Ministry of Media and the Saudi General Commission of Audio and Visual Media or (GCAM) from 2018 onwards, when the beoutQ piracy started.
SAIP was not operational until 2019. At no point did beIN or other foreign rights holders receive any communication from GCAM that their complaints should be sent to SAIP, or any other Saudi authority.
In a statement, Saudi Arabia makes a commitment to “do its part” to stop copyright piracy. If true, Saudi Arabia should accept the WTO Panel Report and take immediate remedial action.
Regrettably, Saudi Arabia’s statement suggests that it has not yet drawn the necessary lessons from the Panel’s devastating findings and will follow similar steps to what beoutQ has done in the past.

Students currently in Grade 10 rejoiced following the decision Secondary Education Examination (SEE) being cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were many calls following the decision to scrap the national level examination completely. When the National Examination Board declared certification will be issued on internal evaluations, another wave of panic arose amongst these students.
It is no surprise schools go extreme measures in preparing their students for SEE. Each student is doted upon to score the best grades, not for students to evaluate what they have learned so far but for the schools to capitalize on their good grades. Average and above-average students fare well, even in internal evaluations. However, it’s usually not the case for students who are below average in grades. A traceable trend of below average students getting good grades emerged in the past, especially in final board examinations. Now that the SEE has been cancelled, it begs the question: if the internal evaluations are enough for such students to be graded fairly and what negative effects of these grades will manifest into the students’ mental well-being?
Which points to the primary issue—wasn’t education supposed to be about finding your interests, morals, goals, and ambitions rather than just getting good grades? When did getting a good education limit itself to judging students based on their grades only?
The bleak present
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics census of 2011, 65.9 percent of the total population of Nepal is literate. Since then, it has been estimated that the number has gradually increased to about 68 percent. The literacy census is done based on whether an adult can do simple calculations, read and write and use a simple mobile phone. Apart from the national census, a few outdated reports and the national average of grades in SEE, there are no other definite means to measure the effectiveness of educational curriculum in Nepal. Sure, a national average will showcase a graph of how failures have reduced over the years and distinctions have increased, but colourful graphs cannot paint the bigger picture of the current curriculum’s effectiveness in preparing a student to deal with various situations in life.
The Curriculum Development Centre’s primary objectives include finding out and implementing various techniques to assess curricula as well as students. But it seems they have only catered the latter part of the objective.
The Curriculum Development Centre’s primary objectives include finding out and implementing various techniques to assess curricula as well as students. But it seems they have only catered the latter part of the objective. The curriculum developed so far has highlighted in preparing students to face standardized tests rather face life in general. A glaring reality is that although students might do well in these tests, they often feel the knowledge they gain have no practical reference to what they have to face in life after graduation. Most students feel lost in what to do next, overwhelmed at what life has to offer, fearful of making even the smallest mistake leading to failure.
In an attempt to understand the co-relation of the current curriculum and the mental well being of the students, a survey was conducted with 75 participants from various private schools in Kathmandu valley, Chitwan and Biratnagar. A total of 27 questions based on linear choices, multiples choices and written answers were asked. When asked how well they did in school, all participants’ answers ranged from average to excellent but upon asking if they answered only on the basis of their grades, 48 participants said yes. It shows how students often co-relate their time in school to how much grades they managed to get.
Another question asked was if the teachers ever discriminated students on the basis of grades to which surprisingly 66 students responded that they had been mistreated publicly at least once in their school life because they scored less marks. The humiliation, as told by many of the participants, had left significant impact on their ability to perform well in academics. “Being humiliated for low grades was normal in my school,” one of the participants wrote. On the other hand, participants who did great academically lamented they felt tortured to maintain their grades. In fact, those who were inconsistent with their grades were often labelled as ‘bad students’ by teachers.
The survey also found out that the teachers rarely tried to understand the root of the problem or try to change their way of teaching. Instead, the teachers either blamed the students or became more aggressive in their teaching. This resulted in 65% of the participants resorting to extra tuition classes to catch-up. It comes as a surprise because these institutions are one of the renowned private institutions in the country. In other words, if this is the condition of top notch private schools, what hope do we have left in public schools?
Consistent problems

Borrowed curriculum

The irony of our country lies on how we as citizens suspect our politicians are our neighbouring country’s puppets yet fail to realize the foundational system of our knowledge is also borrowed from them. The long tradition of home-schooling and Gurukulas discontinued once the Rana regime took over and established Durbar School as the first formal school. Since then education was provided only to the elites until the 1950s when with the democracy opened it to the masses. However, instead of creating constructive and critical pedagogy from primary to university levels, we did what we do best—copy from the Indian system. The ultimate loss here was that the Indian system was rundown of the British colonial regime, modelled to divide rather than unite people of India. Hence, our education system began restricting education within four walls with massive imbalance in teacher to student ratio. Additionally, it brought forth problems of lack of physical infrastructure in rural areas, lack of textbooks as well as textbooks with only monolingual instruction.
Despite CDC’s attempts of curriculum decentralization through local curriculum policy of giving rights to individual schools to design their own curricula, central bodies subscribed the course books while asking to finish teaching the contents within a given period of time.
A 2019 report based on Participatory Action Research (PAR) project in public school of Nepal by Shree Krishna Wagle, Bal Chandra Luitel and Erling Krogh explained how contextualized teaching and learning has not been the priority of school education of Nepal. The paper highlighted how falling under neo-liberal political agenda of labour market, parents from rural Nepal understood learning as mere securing good exams results. It also reflected how the gap between centrally designed educational policies and implementation widened due to the imitation of western modern ideals of education. Nepal’s education is trapped under misguided westernization in the false hope of modernization. Despite CDC’s attempts of curriculum decentralization through local curriculum policy of giving rights to individual schools to design their own curricula, central bodies subscribed the course books while asking to finish teaching the contents within a given period of time. The obsession with international standards of examinations with influence of geo-politics, Nepal fostered the test and exam-centred curricula permanently.

Examination, comparison and pressure

One might ask how we are ever going to encompass intellectual ability to compete on a global stage without exams. Well, Finland has been doing this—that too exceptionally well. Their motto “Whatever it takes” stems from shifting the curricula’s emphasis primarily on developing student’s ability to learn, completely eradicating mandated standardized tests, and ultimately removing suffocating competitions. Professor Pasi Sahlberg, a former math and physics teacher as well as an advisor in Finland’s Ministry of Education Culture termed the Finnish education system as “preparation for children to learn how to learn instead of how to take a test”.  Ultimately due to the Education Index, Finland was placed amongst the highest in Human Development Index in 2008. The Finns have consistently ranked high in PISA study which compares national educational systems around the world.
On the other hand, schools in Nepal do have extra-curricular activities where students can find their talent apart from academics. Despite some students having exceptional skills in extra-curricular activities like sports, music and art, they are pushed to maintain grades side by side. Students tend to drop their hobbies in pursuit of better grades, pressured by their schools and parents directly or indirectly. In the same survey, students confessed how lost they felt after graduation, primarily because they were unable to figure out what subject they were interested in for higher studies. Instead of offering bright future for students, the current curriculum has forced the students into pressurized environments with high competitions. It doesn’t matter what grades they bring—the pressure to do better gets them in the head. The end result begets students with depression, anxiety, lack of motivation and ambitions.

Victimization of teachers

While we contemplate the perils of students, teachers face the torments of equally unforgiving system. Anthropologist Shree Krishna Wagle observed how teachers were sandwiched between policy provisions of central authorities and the expectations of parents for their child to get good exam results. Teachers face the dilemma to teach curriculum as the content, author Terry Heick says, by practicing thinking simply as a tool. However, he says it’s the teacher’s job to engage fluid intelligence consisting of critical thinking, design, problem solving—where thinking is collective circumstance and where the curriculum becomes thought.
The inability for teachers to teach dynamically also has its roots to inadequate qualifications. Finland has over 62,000 educators in 3500 schools. These professionals are selected from top 10 percent of the nation’s graduates to earn a required master’s degree in education. In contrast, the teaching license exam for primary school held recently in Nepal saw that out of 66,562 examinees, 62,880 had failed the exams. According to results, about 1000 examinees scored zero while about 10,000 examinees scored below 10. The low pass rate has put teachers in overcrowded classrooms consisting of more than 30 students per class. The overwork, exhaustion and limited salary can drain even the most inspiring teachers.

Government’s failure to prioritize 

With a compliant political environment addressing socialism, in order to achieve equality in education, schools require to be funded publicly. But despite government’s promises, the budget for upcoming fiscal year 2020-21 only allocated a mere 11.64 percent of the total budget for the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. Nepal’s pledge to place one fifth of the national budget for education has never been fulfilled. The root problem lies in the people in the government agencies like national official or local authorities. These positions are not held by educators but politicians or businesspeople. In the end, the only one benefitting from the current curricula is none other those seeking to capitalize on education and earn profit. Hence, until and unless the government prioritizes education and shifts its policies intending to introduce student-centred curricula rather than exam focused, the scenario might not change for a while.

The way forward
The most recent step to bring a progressive change in the curriculum of Nepal was the eighth amendment of the Education Act, 2016 in 2019. The CDC which introduced a new curriculum for grade 1 and grade 9 had also envisioned replacing the stream-based education system with a “single-track” curriculum for grades 11 and 12. Apart from three compulsory subjects (Nepali, English and Social Studies/Life Skills), students would be allowed to choose three other subjects as per their interest from any streams such as science, arts, law and others. A welcome stride was the plan to eliminate ranking system with the new implementation of the new curriculum. We are yet to see the plan come to life.
Imagining a student centred curricula is the biggest importance as of now. The reason for this article specifically taking example of Finland’s educational system was for Nepal to learn from it. Questions might arise about how we as developing nation are to learn from a prosperous nation. It must be noted that Finland wasn’t always thriving, especially 50 years ago when the country’s economy had taken a toll. But the country’s immediate recovery plan included radical transformation of the Finnish Educational System. The Nepalese reality differs not much, so the only way forward for Nepal lies in placing our educational system as the key propellant of our economy’s recovery.
Emergence and popularity of Ernst von Glasersfeld’s Constructivist Theory promotes learners to construct rather than store information. Learners are seen as explorers who establish meaning of what they learn in accordance to its relevance in their practical life. According to Professor Bal Chandra Luitel, a visionary researcher in the field of education, we need to develop and adapt a new frame that ensures an open environment to appraisal, critique and exploration. Article 31 of the Constitution of Nepal has listed Right to Education as a fundamental right. It is high time we not only focus on access to basic education but quality education to produce equally affluent workforce that can bring innovation and work hard for a prosperous future of Nepal.

The fiction of Chinese encroachment of Nepali territory pushed by the big media in Nepal has been unceremoniously debunked. One of the leading dailies of the country has published an apology on Saturday for running the baseless front page story.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs had condemned the wrongful stories in various media outlets and there was public outcry as well. Other outlets have deleted the link to the story published on their online editions.
Worryingly, three members of the lower house belongling to Nepali Congress party filed a motion on Wednesday asking the government to inform the parliament about the encroached territory. Their motion remarks that China has taken more than 64,000 hectares of Nepali land in different districts.
Citing a dubious “report” prepared by the Department of Survey under the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, (actually the department is under Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation) the news stories had alleged that the Chinese had taken Nepali land at 11 different places along Nepal-China border. Even a respectable figure who currently serves as a member of the expert committee formed to collect evidences on Nepal-India border provided a quote about China taking control of Rui and Tegha villages in Gorkha district in Gandaki Province.
Conveniently forgetting the fact that Nepal and China have amicably settled the boundary dispute in 1960s, mainstream media pushed the narrative of Chinese encroachment. On October 5, 1961 Nepal and China signed on a Border Agreement following which both the countries had carried out border determining surveys.
For the convenience of the locals, both the countries had agreed to swap lands while settling the border. The land swap focussed on providing pastures for the shepherds within their own country. Following this, another agreement was carried out on August 14, 1962 to provide citizenship cards to the locals who agreed to become citizens of respective countries as per the swap deal. The locals were given full freedom to choose the country of their liking.
Respectable media outlets should have read this history before making the claim of Chinese encroachment. But it is also true that the issue of shifting of border pillar at Lamabagar in Dolakha district in Bagmati Province needs to be settled. Nepal-China Joint Boundary Committee formed in 2006 to renew boundary protocol has not carried out any meetings since 2010. Leaving the issue unanswered may create problems in the future as people with vested interests in derailing Nepal-China relationship can play on it.
However, the timing of the publication of the fictional news of Chinese encroachment could not have been more wrong as Nepal has staked its rightful claim on Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani encroached upon by India since long.
One can surmise the southern neighbour’s hand in publication of this story as almost all Indian media outlets gave space to it and excoriated PM KP Sharma Oli for “gifting Nepali territory to the Chinese”. This seems to be a ploy to deflect attention of the world from Lipulekh dispute and dilute the issue by pushing the narrative that China also has encroached upon Nepali territory, so there is no point in painting India into the corner on border issues.
At a time when India and China are engaged in a bitter border dispute following the violent deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified number of Chinese soldiers at Galwan Valley in Laddakh, India may have inspired its Nepali “assets” to push the story to create animosity towards China. Knowing that India has “lost” almost all its neighbours due to Narendra Modi government’s continuous blunders, this may be one of the tactics to bring the neighbours into the fold by pointing fingers at the dragon’s intentions. Sadly for India, Nepali people could not be fooled with these shenanigans.
This Indian gambit is a mere repetition of history. In 1960s, Indians spread rumours that China had invaded Nepal. Since there was no intrusion, Nepal made a statement refuting the allegation. This has been recorded in the conversations between the then PM BP Koirala and Chinese President Chairman Mao Zedong. (Book “Mao Zedong On Diplomacy“)
Now that the people have seen through this Indian ruse and asked India to sit for the talks, it would be interesting to see what India’s next move could be. There are other efforts of presenting China as the country to be feared. WION has published an interview with Lobsang Sangay, head of Tibetan government-in-exile, who warns Nepal of China’s “expansionist strategy”.
Sangay says, “To Nepal and all the neighbouring countries, we have been saying the same thing. The way Tibet was occupied, first they said they will build a road from china to Tibet this will bring prosperity to Tibetans. Once they built the road, they brought in trucks, tanks, guns and soon they occupied us. In the process, they have a very shrewd strategy, which is called elite co-optation–which is to buy off all the elites. Go after your political leaders, your business leaders, intellectuals, your journalist, and your Dharmic leaders. They buy each of the sectors of the community which are elite at the top. So when the actual occupation happens, you realise that elite in the country is divided, one supporting China and one supporting own country.”

There may be an iota of truth in Sangay’s proclamation given that some people in Nepal advocate the Chinese cause more than the Nepali cause. But going by Sangay’s logic, Nepal would have been part of China in 1960s after Kodari-Kathmandu Highway was built to connect Tibet with Nepal. At that time, India had objected to the highway saying that it will facilitate Chinese intrusion but King Mahendra who ruled the country ridiculed India’s concern by saying that “communism does not arrive in a taxicab”.
Mao’s famous saying after the annexing of Tibet that “Tibet is the right palm while Laddakh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh are the five fingers” has been interpreted by Tibetan exiles as China’s intention to gobble up Nepal and Bhutan (the other three are under India). It is difficult to buy this interpretation as no country can absorb an independent country (a UN member) in the contemporary age. As Nepal has never been invaded by foreign power in its long and proud history, it cannot be compared with Taiwan or Crimea.
But given that the Americans are seeing an opportunity in destabilizing Tibet after the death of Dalai Lama, China may give extra attention to its border. If Nepal remains the playground of Western powers (a worrying scenario post-monarchy), China may feel threatened and create buffer zones in northern parts of Nepal to secure its border. Nepali leaders need to ensure that this development does not occur.

http://english.lokaantar.com/current_affairs/afs-report-torture-detainees-police-custody-published-reparation-strongly-recommended/,"
Kathmandu, 26 June (2020) – In order to commemorate the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture-2020, Advocacy Forum-Nepal (AF), a human rights organization, has published a report on torture/ill-treatment of detainees in police custody presenting an analysis of data collected from detainees in police custody and Child Correction Homes (CCHs) in 2019.
This year, AF also analysed data on compensation to assess the effectiveness of the laws, policies and practices in place to provide compensation and reparation for victims of torture.
Despite the right against torture guaranteed as a fundamental right under Article 22 of the Constitution of Nepal, AF has found a continuing prevalence of ill-treatment/torture of detainees at the hands of the police. Nevertheless, the degree of forms and severity of torture has changed and decreased since the end of the conflict, though has not yet been eliminated as the Constitution envisions. Hence, torture and ill-treatment is not an issue that ended with the conflict but rather remains a prevalent crime at present.
Through an extensive collection and analysis of data, the major findings of the report are:

8% of the detainees interviewed (1,005 detainees) reported torture or other ill-treatment, a decrease from 23.5% in the 2018 report. Similarly, 24.5% juveniles (out of 269 juveniles) reported being subjected to torture/ill-treatment.
Despite the compensation ceiling being Nrs. 1,00,000, courts often award only Nrs. 10,000 to Nrs. 25,000.
Only 15.22% survivors have received compensation following court order, the remaining decisions of the courts have not been implemented.
Lack of a legal mechanism for the protection of victims of torture and the witnesses exposes them to threats.
The domain of reparation is very narrow with only monetary compensation as the mere element. The legal framework has avoided rehabilitation, satisfaction, restitution and guarantee of non-repetition, the crucial aspects of reparation.
There a gender variable in the trend of torture with women being subjected to torture/ill-treatment more than men. 26.32% of women (in contrast to 19.8 for male detainees) reported being subjected to some forms of torture/ill-treatment.
The number of juveniles in CCHs exceeds the maximum capacity of such homes, increasing the risk that children are exposed to COVID-19.

Torture is a serious human rights violation which causes lifelong physical and mental trauma to the victim. Often times, the victims are unable to rise from the trauma and thus continue to live a life in pain and sufferings. Thus, torture continues in the victim’s life rather than ending with the incident. This makes the prevention of torture very important in protecting a cluster of human rights, including the right to fair trial.
The prevalence of torture in fact provides a  bleak picture of a country’s human rights commitments and reputation. While AF applauds the positive step of the Government in criminalization of torture through the Penal Code, which came into force in 2018, it has observed legal loopholes because of which detainees are still subjected to some forms of torture/ill-treatment at the hands of the arresting authorities. AF reiterates that the prevalence of torture and the subsequent lack of accountability on such cases is a violations of constitutionally guaranteed rights and mockery of rule of law which fosters  the prevailing culture of impunity.
One of the fundamental responsibilities of a State is to ensure that no rights are violated and where they do, that victims are entitled to truth, justice and adequate reparation. However, the notion of reparation in Nepal is very narrow and that narrow lens does more injustice to the victims than justice. It is therefore an immediate need that the notions of reparation be widened as per international standards in order to provide true justice to the victims as envisioned by the Constitution and existing laws.
In light of the findings, AF has recommended that:

Effective remedies for victims of torture should be ensured,
Organizations providing free legal aid such as AF should have unhindered access to government detention facilities,
Provisions of compensation and reparation in the existing laws should be amended as per international standards,
The police should register FIRs in all allegation of torture, and carry out investigation with due diligence,
The law related to torture should be amended to remove statutory limitation for torture, introducing reparation for victims and making punishment proportionate to the gravity of crimes,
Medico-legal education should be made a part of medical education,

AF has appealed all the stakeholders concerned to have a common view on prohibition and accountability on torture and ill treatment.

Doha, 23 June (2020) – The State of Qatar participated in an extraordinary meeting of Arab League’s council at the ministerial level to discuss developments in Libya and the file of the Renaissance Dam.
The State of Qatar was represented during the meeting, which was held today via video conferencing system, by HE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sultan bin Saad Al Muraikhi.
In a speech to the meeting, HE Sultan bin Saad Al Muraikhi said that the State of Qatar stresses the need to respect the sovereignty of States and non interference in their internal affairs, and the need to avoid standing with one party against another for personal goals and interests and to seek serious collective work to make the political process in Libya successful, in a way that leads to a comprehensive settlement to enable Libya to achieve the desired stability and ensure its sovereignty and territorial integrity and the security and safety of its citizens.
He commended the internationally recognized Government of National Accord for its efforts to uncover the perpetrators of the torture incident against a number of Egyptian citizens in the city of Tarhuna as well as its efforts to secure their safe return to their homeland and take legal measures to punish the perpetrators of this crime.
He added: “The unity, stability and sovereignty of Libya along with the integrity of its lands and independence as well as stopping the bloodshed and preserving its capabilities and wealth are a goal we all aspire to and we strive to achieve it.”
In this context, His Excellency renewed Qatar’s support to the Government of National Accord in Libya, and its call on all Libyans to implement the Skhirat Agreement and its outputs along with return to negotiations and national dialogue and the completion of the transitional phase in order to preserve Libya’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and achieve the aspirations of the Libyan people.
HE the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the State of Qatar affirms its support for all efforts aimed at ending the conflict in Libya and moving forward towards building a state of institutions and protecting and promoting human rights. It stressed its steadfast position to reject all forms of external interference in the Libyan internal affairs in all its kinds and sources.
He added: “We are all sure that the continuation of the conflict in Libya is being paid for by the brotherly Libyan people and is draining the resources of their country, instead of using them to rebuild and achieve sustainable development.”
In this regard, His Excellency stressed the State of Qatar’s call on all parties to assume their legal and moral responsibility and respect and implement international laws and agreements to ensure the protection of civilians and civilian facilities, in addition to holding accountable all those responsible for crimes and human rights violations, especially systematic and extrajudicial killings proven by mass graves recently discovered in areas controlled by rogue militias.

Human civilization has come a long way from the stone-age to agricultural, industrial and technological revolution. But our generation still faces the remains of inequality that had existed in various stages in the history. Focusing on gender inequality in this essay, I am also not denying that there are other forms of inequality present in different parts of the world, given that gender inequality is the common phenomena in every corner of the globe. Female and male are biological terms while men and women are the societal terms created by us. In ancient days when the main activity of the world was revolving around defence, war and agriculture, women were regarded inferior for not having physical strength equal to men due to various biological reasons. Even today, where the world is solving problems not by its physical strength but by the power of knowledge, there has not been significant participation of women in various strata of the society. Moreover, only a quarter of professionals around the globe in the STEM sector are women.
In Nepal, there still lies a stereotype that engineering is not for girls. In spite of this, I find myself a lucky to have supporting parents, who motivated me to pursue my bachelors in architecture.While in college, I found out that only about 10% of the students were female and some more in architecture department. I was in my final year during devastating earthquake in 2015. After completion of my bachelor studies, I wanted to gain some experience before further studies. In the scenario of post-earthquake period, responsibilities of engineers towards society had been more than ever in the history. I volunteered during emergency period for temporary shelter construction through Lumanti Support Group for shelter, where I got chance to work with communities and grassroots. Amid post-earthquake scenario, a national level design competition was held by Nepal Engineer’s Association in collaboration with government and UNDP. I and my friend decided to take part and also made to the consolation prize by the prime minister, on professional category, which I believe as one of the most important motivating factors in my professional life. Then, I joined National Reconstruction Authority for post disaster reconstruction.
Working as a government representative to the rural areas of southern Lalitpur, I was to act as a bridge between the government and the local people. The area was not only geographically challenging but also socially backward. Majority of the people were uneducated and unaware as waves of development had not touched this small village of Bagmati rural municipality, even though it was a part of Lalitpur district. I got opportunity to see a different side of Nepal, the rural life, livelihood, lifestyle of people and their innocence, and I give this credit to the engineering profession that I had chosen. There was only a man who was studying engineering in Kathmandu from the village and he was the first one to pursue engineering. So, it was quite surprising and curiosity among villagers on me, as being a woman engineer going to the village and living there for post disaster reconstruction, far from home alone. It was quite difficult for some of the elders to convince them that I was engineer and that I came to help them. Some of them also thought that I was sub-engineer or assistant sub engineer and questioned my education. They said I did not look as an engineer. Anyway, after working there for months, they believed on me through my works and trainings given to them. I worked there for two years and I hope the villagers will not be surprised anymore if they meet some other women engineers now. As most of the societies are in rural settings, the village can be a representative example of how our society perceives women in engineering sector and how the views changes after being exposed to women engineers and their work.Beneath all of the discrimination and stigma seen especially in ruralcommunity, real change is being made by woman engineers throughtheir presence and representation as woman leaders.Women in engineering are not only capable of carrying out their profession but also are capable of changing the beliefs and stereotypes of the society.
After two years in the village, I was transferred to the district office for some months and now I am working at the central office of National Reconstruction Authority. Working in the district and central office is different from that of the village, but the context on gender mainstreaming is not quite different either. The female engineers were often not involved in important discussions and their potential were under evaluated. They were given works on the office and their involvement in site, tendering and documentation was quite low. All of my seniors were men in the district office. While working at central office, I had got a chance to meet two women senior engineers, from whom I was very inspired. According to a study, only 30% of the women who earn bachelor’s degree in engineering are still working in engineering 20 years later. Given the society we have where women are buried with many family and societal responsibilities as the top most priority, this case couldn’t be an exception here. There are only few women studying engineering and fewer continuing their engineering profession. This could also be the reason why it was hard for me to meet women engineers in higher position of government offices and universities.

Nepal is way ahead in terms of some indicators in gender dimension, with the woman president and over 40% of the women elected in local level election. But it seems like the inclusion has only been made on the political platform and the participation in other key sectors is still poor. Gender mainstreaming is really important in the engineering sector as well. As education has a neighbourhood effect, it doesn’t only serve the woman herself but also plays the vital role in the family and in transformation of the society. For this, rethinking how young girls are raised is very important. The stories of women engineers can be exemplified to give the strength and motivation to young girls that engineering is not only the men’s world. This process cannot happen at a glance but needs constant efforts from the family and society. This can only help in the paradigm shift on how young girls choose their role model and can think beyond the limitations they think they are bound to. There are more difficulties for rural girls to come in this sector due to various socio-cultural and economic obstacles. Women engineers and professional organization should reach out those young girls to motivate them towards engineering.
Eve after pursuing their degrees in engineering and architecture, most of the women are not seen to be continuing their profession. It’s really necessary to debunk the reasons on what is pulling those women engineers from working. In our case, there are of course the societal norms and values, the after-marriage scenario, family responsibilities which are some of the seen reasons. But, its time for women to choose our path ourselves and have a willpower to do on what we are supposed to do as women engineers. Its time to support each other, and create an environment where more women will be welcomed, empowered and sustained. It the responsibility of our own, to be proactive and be a part of change this society demands today.Young girlsfind inspirations through our teachers at university, seniors at offices and women figures at home. All we need is to support each other and show solidarity to our professions. The unity among women engineers in Nepal, will not only just mainstream the women in leading and managerial positions of engineering sector, but also motivate young girls to pursue one, which ultimately contribute to incorporate gender in this sector and towards achieving gender equality.

It is difficult to imagine the sheer volume of suffering unleashed across the world as a result of the global pandemic known as Coronavirus (COVID-19). Little did the wider world expect that from a few isolated cases of a new virus appearing in Wuhan, China in late 2019 that life as we all knew it would change immeasurably in such a short time.
In January 2020, I travelled from the UK to Nepal to prepare to begin my studies at Kathmandu University. At this point in time, the virus was still in its infancy and whilst it was increasingly being discussed worldwide within the media, the numbers of the infected were still relatively small. In fact, at this point in time there was only one known case of COVID-19 in Nepal and that person was said to have recovered.
So, life in Kathmandu carried on as normal. I attended lectures at the University and thrived in the hustle and bustle that is the backdrop to life in Kathmandu.
However, this was not to last. The spread of the virus was relentless and on March 24, 2020, Nepal entered a period of lockdown. Suddenly businesses were forced to close, traffic was stopped, schools and universities closed, and everyone was told to stay home. Life in Kathmandu changed in a single stroke.
Large and potentially fatal epidemics always present challenges to the normal workings of society. The global disruption COVID-19 has caused to daily life, routines and connections has exposed the precariousness of many things we all take for granted.The impact of lockdown on businesses and livelihoods is well documented, but what is talked less is the psychological impact on people’s wellbeing of being told to isolate themselves and ‘stay at home’.
We all have a fundamental need to belong in our communities and to maintain close relationships with others and the failure to fulfil such needs, particularly in the long term, could lead to significant physical and psychological harm. There have already been reports of increased numbers of suicides and reported mental health problems in Nepal during the initial lockdown stage, showing us that the problems being faced by people as a result of the pandemic are far from superficial.
Interacting with each other, either to socialise, work or for the general functioning of everyday society is so important for our wellbeing, and supports our sense of social cohesion and belonging. The pandemic and the social distancing measures put into place to stop it have forced us to rethink how we understand our communities and how we interact with each other. Social cohesion within communities arises out of solidarity with each other, either materially, or through shared beliefs but also through this recognised interdependency.
In short, we need each other. Given this need we as human beings have to interact together when faced with the lack of social contact created by lockdown and social distancing people have found ways to adapt and create new channels of communication. However, it cannot be assumed that these are useful or accessible to all and therefore it is important to consider how these new ways of interacting are affecting different individuals and communities.
In this era of technology many of us are fortunate enough to be able to connect virtually with our families, friends and colleagues to maintain our social relationships and everyday connections.Where the technology exists, or allows, work is now being done from home. Students are studying online, and people are using virtual platforms to communicate more than ever. For some people key elements of their lives are carrying on, if not normally, at least in a not too damaging way. However, the reality will be very different for many others.
Whilst it is so important for our wellbeing that we keep our connections alive socially, if we cannot do this physically, we must be aware that the lack of access to technology particularly within rural or economically disadvantaged parts of the world may exacerbate an already significant digital divide. Not everyone has ready access to technology and the lockdown and social distancing requirements will have disproportionally affected those economically disadvantaged communities who will have fewer alternatives (like replacing face to face activities with technology) at their disposal. The danger is that this will increase poverty, and further deepen inequalities and social discrimination within our society.

So with all these new measures in place to restrict in-person interactions and tactile experience, what kinds of human sociality can we anticipate to be evolving? The simple answer is: it depends on how long the COVID-19 outbreaks are going to last. If the current public health measures are going to continue, it is very likely that the nature of our one-on-one interactions will also undergo long-term dramatic transformations with damaging consequences for many.
However, what is becoming clear is that these virtual communities and ways of communicating are not an adequate substitute for being able to gather and interact with those around us. The increase in mental health and anxiety disorders, loneliness and isolation seen here in Nepal, and across the globe indicates that our local communities are more important to us than they have recently been given credit for.
It appears that other people will always be the most important thing in our lives, and in the same way that our ancestors could not have survived without being part of a physical community, neither can we.

A considerable issue observed recently in children’s’ learning has emerged from the limited care of their need during disaster by government and academics. These limitations are the result of limited awareness in disaster management proactiveness which is influenced by the level of detailed thinking at the top level.
First, an experience impact learning, as we know that each of the person, either a child or an old person, does have some experiences or learning as it is said that no one has a blank mind even it is something a new discipline. Second, the environment is essential to make the space for association and to set up a sustained culture at family, network or school for kids which is important to create space for interaction and to establish a well nurtured culture at family, community or school for children.
The ecological elements which is in grievous condition now due to COVID pandemic and this gives a feeling that how youngsters are being knowledgeable about this natural factor. Thirdly, Educational pedagogical method which is additionally a significant factor to impacts the procedure of knowledge building and reflecting it. The knowledge that assembles the issue just as it takes care of the issue are legitimately or in a roundabout way connected with these three regions of influences on the need of children’s education.
While there are contemptable disparity appears in children educational arrangement due to COVID 19 lock down impact. The pedagogical question emerged in my mind whether education is for learning or not? How society is associated with this procedure? Is learning of children more in the society, family or  at school? How we can synchronize all of these important platforms?How are we strategically making consideration to these wider needs?  The virtual learning process coming up as another wonder in a portion of the urban school has additionally brought up this issue. Is it reasonable for children experiencing virtual learning? My basic inquiry, is it commendable learning? Do they have sufficient time to interact their experiences? Or what environment are created to cater the need of them? How objective the process adopted? Shouldn’t something be said about the nonverbal communication? Are these children have adequate consideration and fortitude to control their arrogancy?
In one side, there are numerous guardians and activist accusing that they are propelling virtual class to collect the fees and charges? Also, in opposite side, the school board and their affiliation are reacting by expressing that it is for children learning need. Both have a solid and legitimized concern; however the thing is the manner by which our academic procedure are received. Are schools ready to utilize the appropriate methodology for the holistic development need as suggested by Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy for the educational performance parameter? Or what alternatives are available with parents to foster the need of children? Are these parents being well informed and aware of the children learning needs? So, the question is how we are enabling the environment, experiences and methodological process. The kids ought not be given issue with the name of any type of inverse thoughts as their education is the basic rights and a way to develop their personality and championing themselves. The meaningful solution is needed as school should compromise their fees in context to the circumstance  and parents should be ready to offer their active support during this process. So that with a best practice far and wide, we can offer a decent academic procedure for inspiring a balanced way of educational procedure, which was never become an agenda in past as a result of short term visioning neglecting the importance of smooth school management during disasters. We should learn from this and the school safety and alternative educational plan should be mandatory provisioned through policy and procedures. Note that learning can be improved with utilizing different methodologies but this should be done in a regular basis. The charges and other choice can be made utilizing a standard model without politicizing it.
On a very basic level, eeducation must follow larger shifts in society rather than implement isolated ideas. As we see that many expensive private schools are offering different choices and alternatives but the public school (I do not say government school in Nepal)  are reluctant to offer assistance in this circumstance. This is the where we see a bigger gaps of  responsive school sector management modality. As we realize that society is made of people however in setting to Nepal, greater part of the general public are partitioned. One group speak against private schools and others remain silentif they represent the public school or vice versa. While we can likewise have many sub-divisions into these. The private school have more of active, powerful and wealthy  parents whereas public school has lower power society. Yet, there are monstrous holes, in private setting, even the wealthy guardians doesn’t talk a lot, with the proactiveness of school, there is a few activities being attempted where the job of “Vocal Society” isn’t vital. The silent itself speaks much and school takes move in the interest of them. Indeed, even in detached dots, there is a solid message and promotion, that impacts numerous things. Be that as it may, in opposite, in public school setting, even you talk stronger, the society is not functional, or the voice are made quiet.Things being what they are, the role of society in present days seems not relevant. The question is “ Who takes initiation for these public school functioning even it is called public, there is no public who can offer support and the teachers are comparatively less proactive in that settings to start the alternatives? As most of the public school in Nepal are initiated by society not by government and these societies who are well off are now sending their kids to private school, so it is still relevant the term public school in Nepal. If Yes, how to make it really public?
This is generally the impacts of the industrialist and capitalistic framework: The private ownership and freedom of enterprise. Philosopher and writer, John Dewey written in his book that capitalism creates ethical or moral problems in that it affects the welfare of people and it brings a new division of society between working class and white collar. He further said, capitalism creates the concentration of wealth in a small segment of the white-collar class whereas it causes the marginalization and pauperization of the working class and capitalism not merely produces and accelerates the class partition based on the discrepancy of material conditions between the two classes, but also creates and aggravates the conflict of interests between them. And thus, it ruptures the community life of society.

In this way, it is really a concern that this fragmented societal structure and capitalist mentality have a tremendous effect on the children equal right of education. The benefit thought process character of private proprietor and flippancy of government structure has led an illusion in the educational sector now. The imbalance introduced now has an educational issue as well as has a socio-political effect, which will be risen as an issue in future, as vengeance. As we are in a democratic principle with bunches of changes in the middle of, the differences in quality and access of educational opportunities made presently, will have an issue from an equity point of view and considered as undemocratic. This is why, a political will and proactiveness is required to settle these serous concerns. The school therefore should be a place to sustain the democratization principle engaging an important role of society. The school hence should place an emphasis to use the pedagogical process even using virtual mode, that fits the criteria of freedom and a place to start a social reform and connectivity, that COVID has wrecked.
The education system in most countries today not changed significantly over200 years. This is on the grounds that it rose out of the improvement of private enterprise. Students are taught obedience: line up outside the classroom, don’t talk in class, wear correct uniform, complete all assigned homework, follow the teacher’s orders and so on. Here is little room in this structure for social collaboration or learning life skills to cope and build the resilience. However, school is not merely a place of formal learning, yet additionally a place of social learning.
A decent society is the result of a decent educational system and a decent educational system is the result of a decent society. Along these lines, there must be close connections between the school and the public sentiments. In these changing contexts of COVID-19, I see that we can now change our pedagogy or learning in a way that this address the gaps of rich and poor or public or private school. Significantly, the kids ought to have the opportunity to learn. The educational process ought to be utilized thinking about the bigger part of society of their ability, significance with utilizing a correct approach and a due consideration to be given on the effective management of  time, resources and importance of social capital development process!

http://english.lokaantar.com/world/qatar-participates-9th-session-arab-chinese-forum-ministerial-level/,"
Doha, 6 July (2020) – The State of Qatar participated in the ninth session of the Arab-Chinese forum at the ministerial level, which began today and held via video conference.
The delegation of the State of Qatar in the session was chaired by HE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani.
During the session, the State of Qatar said that the Arab-Chinese cooperation is based on common interests, a long history and convergent views regarding many global issues, stressing that the prosperity and security of the Arab world and China require enhancing cooperation and joint action through strengthening joint institutions and projects, in a way that serves the causes of our peoples and achieve regional and global peace.
The transformations and challenges that the world is going through oblige us to work together towards rearranging international relations according to a vision based on cooperation, solidarity and coexistence among all peoples, because peace is what will lead to a bright future in the world and its stability and development, the State of Qatar said.
The Palestinian cause remains at the top of the list of the joint agenda between the Arab world and China, the State of Qatar affirmed, while appreciating the continuous efforts of the friendly Republic of China to advocate the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights to obtain their freedom and end the Israeli occupation of their lands, which necessitates that the international community fulfils its responsibilities in achieving a just solution to the key issue in the region, in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions, the principle of a two-state solution and the Arab Peace Initiative.
The stalled peace process in the region is the result of Israel’s continuous disregard of all international convents and norms, and its persistence in flagrant practices and violations that contravene the provisions of international law, international legitimacy resolutions and the references of the peace process, which will ultimately lead to a crack in the credibility of the international community and its institutions, Qatar added.
The political solution remains the only way out of the protracted Syrian crisis, with all its humanitarian and economic consequences that exceeded the borders of Syria, Qatar stressed, emphasizing that the international community should make sufficient efforts to deal with the Syrian catastrophe and its various complications in order to find a comprehensive solution to the suffering of the Syrians in a manner that preserves the unity, integrity and sovereignty of the Syrian lands.
The State of Qatar pointed out that the situations in Libya is facing many challenges, and everyone’s commitment must be renewed to support the Libyan state and its people to reach stability and to also encourage political dialogue between its parties, in accordance with the aspirations of the Libyan people.
On the Yemeni crisis, Qatar said, “We are all concerned about the continuing political impasse to resolve this crisis that led to the killing, sabotage and destruction of the capabilities of the Yemeni people and their cultural heritage, which requires us to cooperate in order to put an end to this crisis to preserve Yemen’s unity, sovereignty and stop bloodshed of its people. Our move shall be based on the outcomes of the Yemeni national dialogue, the Gulf initiative and Security Council Resolution 2216.”
It explained that this forum is a testament to the shared will of Arab countries and China to establish a successful model for South-South cooperation.
The State of Qatar hoped that the forum would be a strong impetus to accelerate the pace of sustainable development at the national level through complementary work accompanying the efforts to advance the human element, build capacity, transfer expertise, technology and capital, increase the volume of trade exchanges, and create economic investment opportunities without overlooking the cultural aspect.

The conflict bedevilling incumbent Nepal Communist Party (NCP) has not reached any meaningful conclusion. Parleys between two chairmen PM KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” are ongoing but the impasse continues.
Reeling under the weight of Oli’s mismanagement of the party and the government, opponents inside the party are united to depose him. This throw-Oli-out mission has been gaining traction for last one year but Oli has managed to defeat it by throwing one political card after the other.
But things have gone so far that the party appears to be on the verge of a split. Given the history of innumerable instances of communist factions uniting and splitting, the “artificial” unification of CPN-UML and Maoist Centre some two years back seems to have reached it expiry date.
Oli has been claiming that more than the pre-poll alliance (ultimately leading to the formation of NCP) his nationalist stance had ensured communists’ landslide victory in the federal and provincial elections. People gave him the mandate to head the government for the full tenure. Therefore, he chose to ignore Co-chair Prachanda’s pleas to assume prime ministership turn by turn during the current tenure. He even disallowed Prachanda to become the de facto executive chair, reducing him to a ceremonial status.
Feeling pushed to the corner by Oli, Prachanda shook hands with other leaders in the party who are also nursing grievances against Oli. The rival faction leaders’ bottom line is that Oli needs to resign from the post of the PM and also from the chairman. This demand is anathema for Oli and he maintains that he won’t resign from any post.
Oli is confident that his rivals won’t be able to even shake his single hair. He has bluntly told them that he will split the party if push comes to shove. This attitude shows that Oli can go to any length to keep his chair intact, the party be damned.
That Oli can do anything to remain in power is also seen in his undiplomatic utterance last week when he directly accused India of being active in toppling his government in cahoots with the leaders inside NCP. By saying this, he tried to paint his rivals as Indian stooges to generate in Nepali people a sense of hatred against them. This statement further dug the chasm between leaders in the NCP.
Grapevine has it that Oli can even split the party and make a coalition government with the largest opposition party Nepali Congress as they have a common interest in securing parliamentary ratification for the American project Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC). Oli and chief opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba are learnt to have met and discussed about this issue. The US is keenly interested in having MCC passed from the Nepali parliament and is frustrated that the project has been vilified by Oli’s rivals in NCP. Given its desperation in implementing MCC in Nepal, it may inspire strange bedfellows to ensure that happens.
Threatened by the prospect of the party split, NCP leaders seem to have explored a middle way. It is learnt that a five-point draft has been prepared for a broad consensus among party leaders. The draft proposes to provide full authority to Prachanda as the executive co-chair of the party, a government-operation mechanism under the leadership of Madhav Kumar Nepal to monitor and guide government activities, cabinet reshuffling with powerful portfolio to leaders of rival factions, appointments and reappointments in vital posts, and respectful division of responsibilities inside the party.
Even if Oli agrees to all these points for now there is no guarantee that he will abide by them. He will ensure that Prachanda does not gain power in the party given Prachanda’s history of divide-and-rule strategy. The proposed government monitoring mechanism will be a toothless tiger as its constitutional and legal justification will surely be challenged at the Supreme Court. Cabinet reshuffling may take place but Oli won’t provide high-end ministries to the rivals. Other proposals may also meet the same end.
For now, it seems that Oli’s opponents in the party have to make do with his supercilious attitude as he is immensely powerful and they can do nothing to unseat him. Their weakness in being unable to cash in the opportunity when the majority of Standing Committee and Secretariat members are against Oli tells it all. is there for all to see He has been able to put India into defensive position with the issuance and parliamentary endorsement of Nepal’s new political map as it is unable to do anything beyond issuing bovine official statements and taking guilty pleasure in Indian media’s Oli derangement syndrome.

Oli enjoys China’s backing as seen in the hectic meetings of Chinese envoy Hou Yanqi with NCP leaders. The US is also in his favour because it believes that he is serious in ensuring parliamentary ratification of MCC. Chief opposition leader is in league with him and the President is under his pocket.
This power position has made Oli invincible and he is emboldened enough to prorogue the parliament even if the House did not lack business. Common Nepali people are crying under the utter mismanagement of the government but it leaves no impact on Oli.
Oli, by using political stratagem to secure his post, has further contributed to the generation of apathy in Nepali people for the current political system. The bitter political bickering inside NCP has muddied the political process and has frustrated people so much that there is a possibility of uprising against existing polity. The anarchy loosed upon Nepal for the last 30 years seems to have reached its apogee, inspiring to opt for a drastic change in current state of affairs.

Crouched between the balcony rods, she stared into the vast horizon. The world was a busy place, but at that moment, sitting solitarily at the top of her world, everything seized to exist… just her and the pieces of nature. It was one of those days where she wanted to forget everything and just disappear.
A girl with a serene mind, humming to the melody, the air composed. Maybe it was the beauty of the painted skies or perhaps the novelty of the playful breeze, but there was something that lured her into a world she was unaware of. That was the day; a normal girl became ‘infinite.’
From yellow to amber to red and then finally Stratos, the color-changing sky reminded her of birth and death. As the images of a crying newborn infant flashed across her mind, she shuddered on the thought of the cold blue-black body of the dead. That was when she realized she had not been living but rather waiting for death. So, how many times had she actually ‘lived?’
Thoughts raced her mind, and she couldn’t stop shaking. When was the last time she felt this way? When was the last time she was this confused? When was the last time she was not anxious but rather curious?
Maybe this was the first.
There was the sudden warmth of nostalgia. Time slipped no matter how much she tried to hold on to it. She had been warned, but she never cared to listen. With every blink, a memory flashed. Thoughts paced, but not once did they blur. Oh, how the days were spent!
Some of such days, she would wish that she could go back and change that one decision. But this time it was different. Right then, she was grateful of every breath she had taken; every moment she had live. At this moment, she felt the presence of the whole world, and the air around her no longer seemed to choke her. Everything made sense. The blithe sound of children playing and laughter of the teenagers, they all became a part of her. The world was a busy place, and she was a part of it at last. As a flock of white birds flew above her, it marked the start of a new journey. It marked the birth of a phoenix.
Her soul that was so tranquil was now drifting, drowning, dying, all at the same time. Her serene mind was taking notice of every moment, every mistake of the past and the present. The persistent sanguine silence turned into beautiful chaos and the girl that felt nothing was now feeling everything.
She smiled… finally.
So that was what infinity felt like. Amidst the beautiful creation of God, melting into a part of the earth was where she found her peace, where she could become vulnerable without ever feeling insecure. The world slowly started to darken, but at that moment, she was the moon that glowed in the midnight sky. Even though she left had the world of infinite, she was secretly still carrying a part of it with her. A final gaze at the world above her, and she promised, she made an unbreakable oath.
She’d be there every day to escape, to forget Reality and dive ‘Into infinity.’

Itahari, 12 July (2020) – Exactly on the same day today 54 years ago, Ram Bahadur Limbu was conferred the prestigious Victoria Cross at the Buckingham Palace of the British monarch.
The British Queen had decorated Limbu with the VC on 12 July 1966. After 54 years of this great military achievement, the 85-year-old Limbu is the only surviving Victoria Cross recipient Nepali Gurkha soldier.
Out of hundreds of Gurkha soldiers fighting on behalf of British military in the first and second world wars and also in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Borneo, Cyprus, the Falklands, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, among others, 13 Nepalese Gurkha soldiers have been awarded the Victoria Cross so far.
Limbu is the last and the only surviving Victoria Cross recipient Gurkha soldier in the more than 200 years of the British Gurkha service in British military that includes the death of thousands of Nepalese Gurkhas with 43,000 deaths in two world wars.
Gurkha soldiers of the British Army are regarded as ‘brave’.  And, Victoria Cross (VC) recipients are termed ‘braver’. Ram Bahadur Limbu is the only living Nepalese Gurkha soldier holding the VC title to his prestigious British Army career from 1960 to 1985.
True to the motto of the Gurkha regiments, which goes, ‘Better to Die than to be a Coward’, Limbu was awarded this coveted title for his bravery in a war of Indonesian Confrontation on 21 November 1965 in Sarawak, Borneo. The then Lance-Corporal Limbu was awarded the honorary captain (504075) of the British military. Limbu has exclusively shared his interesting seven secrets as a veteran and brave fighter from Nepal.
1.    The youngest VC recipient
Ram Bahadur Limbu was a 26-year-old member of the 2nd Battalion, 10th Princess Mary’s Own Gurkha Rifles when he got the VC. He is still in the Guinness Book of World Records as the ‘youngest living VC recipient’.  Besides being the youngest VC recipient, he is the only member of Gurkha soldier to win VC after World War-2. Likewise, he is the only member to beg VC from 10th Princess Mary’s Own Gurkha Rifles so far.
2.    The only surviving sibling of the family 
Limbu was born to an extended family of Chyangthapu of Panchthar district of Nepal. His father Tekbir Limbu was a farmer and his mother Tunimaya Limbu was a homemaker of a lower middle-class family in the eastern hills of Nepal. He had four brothers and two sisters. Tragically, he is the only surviving sibling of his family. He has also lost many of his contemporary friends both in his villages and at his military service.
3.     Two marriages 
After around seven years of service into the British military, Limbu was awarded VC from Queen on 12 July 1966 Buckingham Palace. His tiny son of around five-year-old accompanied him.
He lost his wife just around the announcement of his VC. His first fiancé Tika Maya Begha Limbu passed away on 6 February 1966 in Singapore.
He had married with Tika Maya on 31 January 1961 at the hilly hamlet of Perunge, Chyangthapu of Panchthar district. Just a year after the tragic demise of his first wife, he tied his knot with Punimaya Narthung Chamling Rai on 8 April 1967. He has two sons each from his wives.
4.    VC medal stolen at a railway journey of India 
Just a year after being awarded VC, Limbu made his journey to his motherland Nepal via Indian transit. Railway thieves stole his VC when he was in his catnap. Again, he got his replacement.
5.    Time-strict personality 
One of his residencies is in Damak town of eastern Nepal. The town is also the constituency of the incumbent Prime Minister of Nepal, K.P. Sharma Oli. Limbu is highly unhappy at procrastination of different social and public functions in the town. He did not entertain five-minute delay to this interview. He angrily said, ”Not only journalists of Nepal, even the PM comes late in formal functions. I have waited him for hours in this town. This does not happen in United Kingdom”
6.    Great philanthropist 
Octogenarian Limbu is a famed philanthropist. He has donated millions of Nepalese rupees for the constructions of community buildings, temples and public properties in various places of Nepal. Limbu has supported funds to construct road linking his birthplace Chyangthapu.
He has donated plots of land for the construction of ‘Kirat temple’. ”I see people turning philanthropists by using black money”, said Limbu who has difficulties to hear. He added, ”I am happy to utilize my hard-earned white money for philanthropy.”
7.    A leader of Gurkha struggle on discriminatory pay 
There is a big payment difference between Nepali Gurkhas and the British-born soldiers in the UK Army. Captain Ram Bahadur Limbu is not happy on this tragedy. He has led a struggle for petitioning the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair demanding same pay and pension. His initiation was actively supported by British actress Joanna Lumley. RSS

Additional institutions and forums are facing economic sanctions and opposition from the US government, thus breaking the international cooperation and pushing international system in corner.
The Trump administration’s decision to impose economic sanction against the World Health Organization was an unwelcome action and a sheer setback in the international system. Now, President Trump chooses to add the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the high hit list. It is an indirect threat to the European nations who volunteered to set up the ICC as a mechanism to address abuses of war and war-like activities.
Throwing the missile of sanctions, he said that the sanction is a “steadfast commitment to protecting American service members and defending our national sovereignty”. The Trump administration is apparently pushing military strategy in international affairs provocatively, which is a grave regression from multilateral cooperation framework.
This sanction seemingly encourages American security personnel to rescind from respecting international humanitarian and human rights laws in conflicts. Already, the Bush administration obliterated the position of international criminal law’s position by enacting the “Netherlands Evasion Act,” which allows the US government to forcefully rescue its officials from the custody of the court charged with crime against humanity, peace and war of laws.
Now the sanction against the court articulates the ‘willingness of the Trump administration’ as the desired practice of the obsessive theory of American exceptionalism. And this definitely manifests the administration’s entrenched wishes to ignore, rescind and downplay the regime of international law.
The present economic sanction fully disables the court from investigation or prosecution of the US personnel without the consent of the United States. Most unfortunately, the administration has also authorized the expansion of visa restrictions against ICC officials and their family members.
Why the Trump administration chose to take such unwanted step against the court, seemingly demeaning the international effort to prevent inhuman crimes, including violation of the law against war. The need of establishing the court was already prompted by the Nuremberg Trial in 1946, which prosecuted the Nazi war criminals. This international tribunal was then established in initiation of the US administration and it had played crucial role in prosecuting war criminals.
Looking from that vantage point, the US is supposed to ratify the Rome Statute voluntarily as one of the original parties to it. But, to the great surprise of the global human rights and humanitarian communities, the US has not only rejected the ICC’s jurisdiction over United States personnel in war crimes, but also acted to prevent nations under its influence to accept the process of being parties to the Statute.
As most conscious people in the world are aware, the US policy against the court is inspired by its perpetual imperial ambition and its relentless intent to use or exercise the right to use force against any nation or entity, under Article 4 of the UN Charter, preventively as well as preemptively.
Several US intellectuals, including Noam Chomsky, have described this claim as the US’s perceived supremacy over the United Nations and international law. This is definitely a challenge of the US to the freedom and independence of sovereign nations guaranteed by the Charter as well as the customary international law.
The officials in the US administration have frequently argued that ‘the US as a sovereign nation is able to decide to protect and preserve its interests.’ That said, the ICC’s actions are described as attacks on the rights of the American people.  Its jurisdiction is also taken as the violation of the national sovereignty of the US.
The US denial of the court’s jurisdiction includes the United States personnel as well as personnel of its allies and partners. It manifestly implies that the court is disabled to enjoy international jurisdiction against war crimes against citizens or institutions of the NATO members and other countries that the US defines as its partners.
Nepal, for instance, is a partner country of the US pursuant to the MCC agreement. It is the biggest hypocrisy against international law to prevent the scourge of wars and violation of the rights of people to life. Thus US sanctions attempt to subvert the UN regime and the significance of international law.
Arguably, the sanction has expressly legitimated the ‘US hegemony.’  The text of the sanction reads, “Despite repeated calls by the United States and our allies to reform, the International Criminal Court has taken no action to reform itself and continues to pursue politically motivated investigations against us and our allies, including Israel.” It continues, “We are concerned that adversary nations are manipulating the International Criminal Court by encouraging these allegations against United States personnel.  Further, we have strong reason to believe there is corruption and misconduct at the highest levels of the International Criminal Court Office of the Prosecutor, calling into question the integrity of its investigation into American service members.”
The Covid-19 pandemic has severely afflicted human lives. This has now been turned to be not only an economic but a human catastrophe. The poor people in the globe are severely hit and vulnerable to facing further traumatic situation. In the most developed countries, particularly with neo-liberal capitalism, common people have to encounter double tragedy—the crisis of health on the one hand and economic deprivation on the other.
The failure of capitalism and the state structure in the US has proved dysfunctional. The State, under the influence of the powerful rich, is not only unaccountable but also ignorant. The class-based division is acute. However, the drive of the US military maneuverings is seen apparently provocative and aggressive. The resenting attempts to concentrate military forces with powerful naval fleets in the Asia pacific are alarming.

It seems that the US administration is keen to transform the trade crisis with China into cold war, thus accelerating the pace of encircling China as a declared goal. This raises a serious concern against peace and tranquility in the world. Do these affairs heighten the US hegemony in the post-Covid 19 situation? Many people think that it will happen so. If it is true, the world will again face a situation of turmoil and war-driven tragedy.
But the likelihood of the US initiating the war is still scant, the reason being its ailing capitalism and stooping production system. The unregulated market and corporatism have virtually led the US society to the state of javon paradox—the state in which the political and social structures are unable to respond to the problem.
Secondly, China is not inclined seeking the superpower’s place in the globe. It can be argued that China would not afford to be provoked. The American wish that some Asian nations would be prepared to attack China as per the desire of the US is unlikely too. The likelihood of India flying to the Western alliance is increasing, but it would be fatal to the Indian interests itself. Joining the alliance with the US and Israel, along with proxy status of NATO, India will lose Iran and will severely cut off from countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and the larger Islamic world.
Such maneuverings will push Iran and Pakistan more closely attached, and Russia may distance with India as well. Ultimately, the Indo-pacific game may turn against India, a costly choice for that nation. Nepal’s silent but active drive to flirt with the US Indo-Pacific may also face a blow.
The present US sanction should therefore be viewed in the present context of its increasing nexus between military campaign and diplomacy. Hopefully, the so-called human rights campaigners in Nepal will pay attention to this regressive action.

Internal strife in the incumbent party NCP seems to have taken a pause for the moment.
The unending parleys between two chairmen Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” has not seen a logical conclusion as yet. But it appears that Prachanda has given in to Oli’s unbending stance.
Prachanda had made alliance with party senior leaders including Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal against Oli. During the Standing Committee meeting, this faction asked Oli to resign from both the PM and the party chair, citing his mismanagement that has been denting the party’s image. This demand irked Oli and he kept saying that he will not resign from his post as resignation will send an unsavoury message that he is an incompetent helmsman.
Oli addressed the nation Friday night in which he accepted that there were differences in opinion in the party. He urged the leaders to have patience and forbearance for the proper conclusion of the current dispute.
Prachanda, on the other hand, reached his constituency in Chitwan on Saturday and said that he was exercising maximum restraint and patience, saying that there would have been an accident if he made hurry. By uttering the word accident, he seems to have alluded to the spilt of the party.
In fact, Oli was so inflexible to rival leaders’ demand that he was mulling the split. In expectation of such a scenario, some of his loyalists had registered UML party at the Election Commission. To put the development in context, UML and Maoist Centre had merged to form NCP that is currently ruling the country.
Oli’s implied threat of party split seems to have dampened Prachanda’s excitement.
Let us indulge ourselves in a scenario in which the party is split. Oli will be the one and only leader of the new party with absolutely no chances of disloyalty and factionalism.
But power bargaining will continue in the new party as Prachanda, Nepal and Khanal will jostle to have the best position. Sources have been saying that Nepal wants to bag the post of the PM while Khanal angles for President and Prachanda aims to be the party chair. Even if this division of responsibilities seems smooth in paper, it does not factor in power bargaining that will certainly take place in the future. And Prachanda’s shifty nature raises the issue of credibility.
Coming back to reality, it appears that Oli and Prachanda have developed a written agreement in which both may have negotiated to further explain the previous agreement where Prachanda was given the responsibility of handling the party but he was unable to effectively wield power. Prachanda wants to enjoy the de facto executive role of the co-chair (so far he is the ceremonial chairman) and Oli may relent to it as this arrangement will stop Prachanda from demanding Oli’s resignation.
It had appeared that both the chairmen would keep digging their heels in for a long time but now they have relented. What factor made it possible? Is it due to the active role played by Chinese ambassador Hou Yanqi? Did the Indian spooks that have surreptitiously landed in Kathmandu any role in it? Is second-rung leaders’ claim in the credit for the thaw between two chairmen valid? These are some of the questions whose answers only the chairmen can provide.
Whichever force may have prevailed to break the ice between two top leaders, the party seems to have returned from the verge.
But it is a fact that Prachanda and other leaders are wrong in asking Oli to resign in the midst of the tenure. It is true that Oli and Prachanda had made an agreement a day before the party unification to take turns in assuming the post of the PM. But the second agreement in which Prachanda agreed to not stake claim to the post of the PM and remain executive chairman effectively put paid to the first agreement. The current debate is all about whether to return to the first or to the second agreement.

It should be clear as day that the existence of Prachanda and former Maoist party was in peril before the merger with UML to form the NCP. The pre-poll alliance between UML and Maoist Centre saved Maoists from being consigned to the dustbin of history. The alliance that facilitated the unification of the party proved to be a life saver for the career of top Maoist leaders.
Riding the wave of nationalism fortified by KP Oli’s undeterred stance against India during the blockade, the alliance secured landslide victory in the elections. (Oli has continued standing the nationalist ground even in the face of Indian disinformation campaign which has stooped to lower depths in the form of baseless and sleazy media reports.) In other words, the people’s resolute opinion was that Oli should lead the government for the full tenure. In fact the first agreement went against the popular opinion.
Therefore, Prachanda becoming the PM disregards people’s mandate. Moreover, changing of guard at a time when the country is going through diplomatic troubles does not spell well for the country. This critical time demands the house in order so that Nepal can stake its rightful claim against Indian encroachment on Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani in reality, a point ahead of cartographic assertion.
Upsetting the apple cart at this situation is completely unwarranted. Changing the leadership is valid only during the party convention. But it does not mean that Oli can be let go of the criticism for the utter mismanagement of COVID-19 response and overall governance situation.

In 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the constituent assembly of Nepal had said that ‘India has won no war without the support of the Nepalese.’ Nepal took this statement as an acknowledgment to the valiant warriors from Nepal who have been sacrificing their life for the security of India.
Nepali citizen Sambur Gurung, a Havildar in Indian army, died while while maintaining peace in Kashmir. Gurung is the second Nepali soldier serving in the Indian army to be killed by Pakistan army’s firing in a less than a month.
Prior to him, Indian army man Havildar Dipak Karki, permanent resident of Nepal, was killed on 22 June in the same place. Many Nepali people who work as Indian Army personnel have been relinquishing their life to reaffirm Modi’s claim.
But the irony is that the Prime Minister who once had expressed his regards towards the Nepali people during the first tenure is overseeing Nepal-India relations at the lowest point in history. This happened during his both tenure.
The worsening of relations seems to have appeared as a boon for PM KP Sharama Oli. He promised economic prosperity and good governance at the parliamentary elections three years back. The promise has faded as time passed. Now the government indulges in light issue while neglecting the deeper one.
The two unnecessary ordinances, Constitutional Council Ordinance and Political Party Ordinance, 2020 (which was aimed to split the parties), in the middle of the pandemic serve as anecdotes to manifest how serious Oli government is in regards to state affairs. The ordinance with ill motive was vehemently criticised within his own party and the secretariat which is a conglomeration of nine senior leaders of Nepal Communist Party.
The majority members of the Secretariat and the Standing Committee of his party had an opinion to topple him from power both as a party President and Prime Minister.
No doubt, Prime Minister Oli is in power by raising radical slogans. But this is the in-house problem of Nepal. Nepal can seek its solution. Meanwhile, the extreme nationalist clique in India and some media persons have tried to sabotage the integrity of Nepal. This has provided much-needed leverage to PM Oli.
Amidst the failure in various spectra of domestic politics, Oli got a fillip when India inaugurated a road connecting Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand of India to Mansarovar, China on the 8th of May. This 80 km road runs through almost 18 km land of Nepal.  Immediate to that Nepal held an all-party meeting and decided to oppose India’s move unanimously. Prior to that Nepal also had promptly rejected the eighth series of political map of India, which includes Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh as a part of India. Nepal from then till now has urged for a dialogue which India has denied for various reasons.
Historically, the Kalapani area has been an integral part of Nepal. Since there was some misunderstanding between Nepal and India regarding the very area, Nepal had agreed to term it a disputed region. Both the countries had agreed to find the political solution to it. Defying the previous agreement with Nepal, India included the area in its newly released map and later on inaugurated a road in the area.
Nepal had no choice but to answer India. Nepal parliament on 13 June unanimously endorsed a new political map which included the area of Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh. Once Nepal decided to accommodate this area Indian media have been using slanderous language against Nepal.
The derogatory contents continuously disseminated in some Indian media outlets against Nepal for sure won’t mend the bilateral relations.
‘Indian media in word-war against Nepal’
Once Nepal laid her rightful claim to lands up to Limpiyadhura, distinguished personalities from various walks of life in India started vomiting poison against Nepal. The derogatory contents continuously disseminated in some Indian media outlets against Nepal for sure won’t mend the bilateral relations. Those contents could keep media busy for a day but it definitely will affect the bilateral relations for the years to come.
The news hinting at the close relationship between PM KP Sharma Oli and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi is reprehensible and regrettable.
Baseless news item broadcasted by an independent media house has raised a question of credibility of Indian media. Especially when the relations between the two countries are at a low point, Indian media transmits such vile news. Doesn’t it vindicate the state’s role in production of such content? How could the Indian state mechanism allow such a disparaging content about an executive head of a neighbouring country?
In his book Does the Elephant Dance? (p. 117) Canadian writer and diplomat David M Malone refers to the former secretary for India’s External Affairs Ministry Rajiv Sikri who says that, ‘Indians have taken Nepal too much for granted. India’s approach towards Nepal has been dismissive and neglectful. The Indian government and public have never shown adequate sensitivity to Nepali pride and uniqueness.’ Sikri’s interpretation of his fellows’ thinking seems true in this very matter.
Had not been so, instead of jettisoning the bilateral issue, media should have focused on embellishing a favourable environment where both the countries could feel comfortable to share their point. Media could have played a role to redeem the deteriorated relationship between two countries. Unfortunately, it didn’t happen. It eerily projects that neither the Indian government nor the media seem to have taken Nepal seriously. This is insult to injury for Nepal.
Indian media are particularly sceptical about China’s proactive role in Nepal’s politics. The unwarranted claim from the Indian media that ‘Nepal’s PM has intimate relationship with the Chinese Ambassador to Nepal comes amid ambassador’s meeting with the senior leaders of the NCP. This meeting took place at a time when the NCP has internal tension. The hue and cry is because China took the baton from India to interfere in the domestic politics of Nepal.
When it comes to China’s changing position and intensified posture in Nepal Nepal is worried more than India. Intimidated by India’s enduring interference in Nepal’s domestic affairs, Nepali people are wary that China does not do the same. On the other hand, Nepal recently has seen the border escalation between India and China. Therefore, it is to be believed that India has bigger fish to fry.
Paying unnecessary attention to the host country’s internal affairs by the embassy of any country is a breach of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961. Article 41 of the Convention clearly states that ‘Diplomats have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of the hosting states.‘ Nepal has to condemn the recent activities of the Chinese embassy if it tries to manipulate the internal affairs of Nepal. India is no exemption to it.

Whenever India meddles in the internal politics of Nepal, Nepali people are riled and history provides the evidence. With every trespassing in domestic politics of Nepal, India has burn the bridge with many Nepali people who used to be sympathetic towards India. People who witnessed the 1989 blockade are the fierce critics of India today. People who experienced the economic blockade of 2015 might have the same attitude towards India in the coming days.
India’s attitude towards Nepal in the aftermath of the promulgation of Nepal’s constitution in 2015 and the recent border dispute subsequently followed by the Indian media coverage to defame Nepal might lead the bilateral relation from worse to worst. Especially, the understanding of India in the youths of Nepal will move towards negativity if this sort of thing keeps happening. On the other hand Indian government tireless repudiation for the border talk for sure will increase anti-Indian sentiment in the public.
When it comes to the recent border dispute between Nepal and India, Nepali media is presenting the proper reason why Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh belong to Nepal. Although the Indian media has claimed that the area belongs to India, they have not been able to present any evidence to substantiate their claim. Rather than presenting the evidence they relying on expert’s opinion. The biggest apprehension arises when the Indian expert counters the evidence projected by Nepali side and lack to present their own.
While the Nepali people are claiming the land with the historical evidences some Indian media are spreading propaganda against Nepal. Is it because they lack the proper document to stake their claim to the land? If not, why are they engrossed in sabotaging personal dignity and making it a matter of public consumption? Had they had adequate evidence, they would be inclined for proper discussion rather than manufacturing news.
On 3 July, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Ladakh. The speech he gave there was viewed with special interest in Nepal. Addressing the Indian troops to boost the morale amid the rising tension with China at the border he said that ‘the era of expansionism has come to an end’.
Yes, we believe that the era of expansionism is really over. We solicit that Indian troops who have been living in Nepali soil for nearly 60 years will return soon and that deteriorated relations between Nepal and India will soon return to normalcy.

http://english.lokaantar.com/world/international-court-justice-rules-qatar-can-challenge-airspace-restrictions-international-civil-aviation-organization/,"
Doha, 14 July (2020) – The State of Qatar welcomes today’s ruling by the International Court of Justice (the “ICJ”) that it has the right to challenge airspace restrictions imposed by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain and the Arab Republic of Egypt (“the Blockading States”) before the UN’s aviation body – the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
Since June 2017, the Blockading States have prohibited Qatar-registered aircraft from flying to or from their airports and overflying their national airspaces, in flagrant violation of international law.
In two judgements released today, the ICJ rejected all three grounds of appeal raised by the Blockading States, finding that the ICAO has jurisdiction to hear Qatar’s claims.
The ICAO Council will now resume its proceedings. HE the Minister of Transport and Communications of the State of Qatar, Jassim Saif Ahmed Al-Sulaiti: “We welcome today’s decision by the ICJ that will see the Blockading States finally face justice for violating international aviation rules. We are confident that the ICAO will ultimately find these actions unlawful. This is the latest in a series of rulings that expose the Blockading Countries’ continued disregard for international law and due process. Step by step their arguments are being dismantled, and Qatar’s position vindicated.”
Since the start of the illegal blockade in June 2017, Qatar has maintained that the Blockading States have acted illegally and in violation of international law.
Today’s verdict is the latest in a series of international judgements vindicating this position and finding in favour of the State of Qatar.
It follows a ruling by the World Trade Organization in June that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia breached global trade rules by failing to take action against, and instead actively promoting, broadcast pirate beoutQ. Qatar’s decision to bring claims before the ICAO follows repeated attempts to negotiate an amicable settlement, which have been consistently rejected by the Blockading States.

Doha, 21 July (2020) – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its deep surprise at including the name of the State of Qatar in the war in Yemen and its categorical rejection and denunciation of the false accusations made by the Yemeni Prime Minister regarding the alleged support for the Houthi movement.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Ministry said that it would have been better for the Prime Minister to save this great effort that he exerted in pointing ridiculous accusations to the State of Qatar, and to direct and focus these efforts to stop the tragedy of Yemen, find a formula for reuniting the Yemeni people and provide their urgent needs.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on the Yemeni officials to distance themselves from the intra-regional conflicts, which are intended for them to enter, or employing the tragedy of their people in favor of conflicts that have nothing to do with them.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirmed the solidarity of the government and people of the State of Qatar with the Yemeni people, who have been suffering for years, stressing that it will spare no effort in supporting regional and international efforts to find a sustainable solution to this absurd war.

It was sharp 6 in the morning. Krystal was going downstairs.  ‘Mom!’ she yelled. Krystal is a beautiful girl with curly black hair and  hazel blue eyes . She lives in Kathmandu with her mother and dad. She went to her living room and sat on the sofa and said, Mom I am really tired of hearing the bad news every day. Lock down is extending, thousand’s of people are dying because of corona and I can’t even go out. I am missing my friends and grandparents and I want to meet them physically. But I can’t go outdoor. I am tired of studying story books and watching the movies of super heroes. This lockdown and corona virus is driving me crazy .It has already been 3 month since the lockdown has started because of the ongoing pandemic corona virus.
Mom exclaimed, Oh! Dear we should not only be thinking about the difficulty of staying home all the time. Have you even thought about the pain of doctors and police? Doctors and police are in their duties to save our lives with out caring about their own life. Police are trying their best to make sure that every people are staying in their homes and people are trying their best to come out of their house. People are blaming, cursing police instead of respecting them. Acutely the police and doctors are our real heroes. We must respect them instead of throwing stone to them. Instead of staying home with their family, they are staying outside only for us. Hard work of the real heroes of our nation should be acknowledged and appreciated.
Krystal said,” That is right. We must respect them, but I really want to go outside. Who is this corona and lockdown to stop me?
Dad told,” But my sweetie, ‘Prevention is better than cure”. Corona virus which is also known as COVID 19 is an ongoing pandemic disease. This virus was originated from Wuhan china from a bat in December 2019. Corona virus is spreading very fast and no one has been able to find its medicine. Everyday thousand’s of people are dying because of corona virus. So, in order to control the spread of corona virus, whole world is locked down. Lockdown is done for our own benefit.  People are not allowed to come out of their houses. They can be safe and sound. Nevertheless some people are still not following this lockdown. Lockdown is a requirement for us in which we have to stay where we are due to some specific danger. And why do you worry if happiness didn’t last forever, how can problems and sadness remain forever. One day surely we will get free from corona and lockdown but for that we must follow the lockdown.
Krystal told,’ Mom but our right to go out of our house has been restricted.
Mom said,’ Ever since the lockdown, many people think that their right to go out of their houses has been restricted and limited. You should   understand that country is locked down for your own benefit and safety. As I think resting in home is far better than resting in peace. If we will come out of our sweet home we may get infected from corona virus and our health can be in danger. Why do you only think about negative factors of lockdown? Why don’t you think about its positive factor?
What are you saying mom there is no positive factor about lock down? said Krystal.
Dad yelled,’ The world is locked down but everything is not locked down, in this modern time we can almost do everything we want from home. World is locked down but many things like creativity, learning, happiness, imagination, story writing, talking with family, gardening, food, air, dancing, singing, communicating, sunshine, water, life, entertainment, spreading love, help, kindness etc are not locked. Environment is getting clean and no chemicals are being mixed in the air, land and water.
Krystal told, whatever dad those were so least positive factor about lockdown, aren’t there some more of them mom? I know your answer of course there aren’t more positive factors about lockdown.2020 is the worst year.
Mom exclaimed, ‘Why are you blaming the year, it is not the fault of the year, it is because of our own carelessness. If we humans had been more aware about following hygienic habits I don’t think that we would have been suffering from this corona virus. And talking about the positive factors of lockdown we can think in the following ways.
Image credit: Florin Cristian Ailene
Because of lockdown we have started to keep our environment more clean and green. People are getting aware about following and focusing on their hygienic habits. They have started to follow many hygienic habits like: washing their hands time to time for at least 20 seconds, wearing mask, using alcohol based soap, bathing everyday etc. People have learned that only by getting rich, wearing fancy and branded clothes, eating fancy, tasty or junk food our life can’t be happy. People have learned that we have to eat good and healthy food, wear the clothes according to the seasons and follow hygienic habits. People learned that no pandit, Dhami or jhakari and other many things related to superstition can cure us.
I think you two are saying right. If we don’t stay at home we never know our life may get locked down forever. In present generation I can also work from home, I can meditate, I eat food, I can sleep well, etc. Because of lockdown we children are getting the opportunity to learn through online classes which are really fruitful and really a new experience for us. I am never going to forget it. Home is better place to stay than to stay in ICU in any condition. I shouldn’t have blamed the year 2020. It is not fault of the year. It is all because of our carelessness by not following the hygienic habits properly, said Krystal.
Mother told, ‘Looks like know you have started to understand that shouting, screaming, worrying and complaining is not the solution to any type’s problems. If possible we have to solve it and if not we have to search for its positive factor and get satisfied with what we have. And we should also not blame others without seeing our mistakes.
Krystal learned that she should not look at the negative side of life. She should focus on the positive side of life. She also learned that she should not blame anything else without knowing our own mistakes.

The bitter dispute in ruling Nepal Communist Party has not ended yet. PM KP Sharma Oli is adamant in clinging to the post while his rivals have been fighting tooth and nail to remove him.
But something unexpected happened in the meeting of the top leaders’ group, namely the Secretariat, on Saturday. Not a single member in the Secretariat asked Oli to resign. The vociferous demand of Oli’s resignation during Standing Committee meetings was not heard in the Secretariat meeting.
What explains this sudden turn of events? Wily Oli is said to have thrown yet another card to save his post in the meeting. Oli admitted that he had taken some wrong steps earlier (issuing ordinances among others) and agreed to self-criticize. He also proposed to call for an early unity Convention of the party that is scheduled for the next year.
Oli wants party Convention to be held in November/December. He seems to have reached at an agreement with co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” for the Convention. Oli must have told Prachanda of his support for the Chairmanship of the party. It means that Oli is seeking a graceful exit from party leadership while keeping the premiership intact at a time when NCP leaders have been demanding Oli’s resignation from both the posts.
Realistically speaking, Prachanda stands no chance of garnering the winning votes for the leadership if Oli does not back him. Senior leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal do not have enough backing of the party cadres to propel Prachanda to the helm. Failing to keep Oli in good books means that Prachanda may have to face Oli as an opponent in the Convention, effectively dooming his chances.
This “agreement” between Oli and Prachanda has left Nepal, Khanal and other anti-Oli leaders gasping. Nepal and Khanal in the Saturday meeting said that early Convention was not possible because party unification process is ongoing. They must have rapped Prachanda’s knuckles for giving in to Oli without taking suggestions from them. This must be the reason why his secretariat issued a statement late Saturday clarifying that that there was no agreement between him and Oli.
Today (Sunday) morning the anti-Oli faction met Prachanda at his personal residence in Khumaltar. Prachanda tried to console them by saying that Oli’s call for early Convention is yet another card to cling to power. He is quoted to have said that early Convention is a fresh ploy as party unification process is still ongoing and membership distribution, ideological discussion and many other issues are yet to be addressed.
Even if Prachanda tried to calm the nerves of anti-Oli leaders, it appears that among nine members of the Secretariat only Nepal and Khanal are against Oli’s proposal. Ishwar Pokharel, Ram Bahadur Thapa “Badal” and Bishnu Poudel immediately supported Oli’s proposal. Narayan Kaji Shrestha, anticipating a ministerial berth in the almost certain cabinet reshuffle, is expected to extend his support even if he opposed the proposal in the meeting. Bamdev Gautam had reservations about the proposal but he considered that convention will yield a win-win situation for all.
Oli’s proposal will be floated in the Standing Committee meeting that is set for Tuesday.

But there are many difficulties in organizing party Convention so early. NCP’s Election Commission Chief Bishnu Pukar Shrestha told Lokaantar‘s Political Correspondent Ishwor Aryal that the party is not ready for the Convention. Central Committee meeting of the party had agreed to tie up all the loose ends in party unification process six months ago but almost nothing has been done. Calling a convention before settling unification issues is not right, he said.
Given many complexities, party Convention does not seem possible in November/December. It may be postponed for a later date, probably the scheduled date in April/May 2021. Therefore, Oli seems to have sown confusion among the rivals by throwing the Convention card. His strategy was to split Prachanda-Nepal-Khanal alliance that was becoming thorny. He seems to have been partially successful in that endeavour.
Given Oli’s history of dishonouring past agreements, Prachanda seems unsure about the latest proposal. But the inability of Oli’s rival faction to march a successful fight too must have disenchanted Prachanda. Either way it appears that Oli is once again successful in saving his post. He has also kept people busy in debating the birthplace of Lord Ram that has shadowed meaningful discussion about the government’s mismanagement.

In court cases, circumstances may be different but facts may stand the same in two different countries.  Whatever is true for a country’s judicature may be same for the other when it comes to securing justice.
In this article, I will explain the notable developments which have taken place in the constitutional jurisprudence since the topmost courts in United States (US), India and Nepal have declared that the fundamental rights can even be implicit over and above those which are explicit in the constitution. Overtime, the horizon of fundamental rights has expanded with creative interpretative process of the constitution in tune with the needs and requirements of the society.
The apex courts of US (Munn v Illinois, 1877), India (Maneka Gandhi v Union of India, 1978), and Nepal (Lenin Bishta v Govt of Nepal and Ors, 2020) have arrived at a unanimous decision—the right to travel is a sacrosanct fundamental right implied under right to life and liberty clause. The judiciaries across the world have stood as a bulwark against the governmental move to restrict a person to fly abroad.
The apex Court’s decision holding that the right to travel makes personal liberty meaningful and it falls within the ambit of right to life and liberty clause enshrined under Article 16 of the constitution was hailed across sections of the society.
In this context, the apex Court’s decision holding that the right to travel makes personal liberty meaningful and it falls within the ambit of right to life and liberty clause enshrined under Article 16 of the constitution was hailed across sections of the society here. The ruling clearly portrays the apex court of Nepal as an active judiciary.
Determining the scope of right to life and liberty that includes freedom of liberty, the Division Bench of Justice Dr Anand Mohan Bhattarai and Justice Kumar Regmi in the case of Lenin Bistha v. Government of Nepal and Others cites Article 12 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which guarantees the right to travel abroad. It says every person shall be free to leave any country, including his own.
In what could be seen as a welcome aspect of the observation of the Supreme Court (SC) is its interpretation of the right to life and liberty clause in the light of international human rights law and natural justice. In police state, one could expect unreasonable caveats or arbitrary exercise of power at the sweet will of the executive but the same cannot be expected in a democratic set-up, held the SC. “The right to travel abroad is revered human rights as it nourishes self-determining creative character of an individual. The freedom of travel helps a person to enhance the scope of his experience.”
Acknowledging international human rights law at domestic levels through robust judicial activism is, of course, a welcome move. This approach of the court would certainly silence the views within the legal fraternity in Nepal which discounts international human rights and believe them as extraneous worldviews.
The learned Justice Dr Anand Mohan Bhattarai then went on to held that democracy is for fostering the marketplace of ideas; all ideas may not be liked by the government in power; nor do all ideas are creative and constructive in nature.  In fact, to fear an idea means to discard self-governance. Justice Bhattarai further held that there can be no attributes more valuable than the life and personal liberty of persons.
“The fundamental freedoms are necessary to enrich personal liberty; and right to travel from one place to other makes the life worthwhile.”  This way, the ruling of the court aims to foster substantive as well as procedural due process in order to expand the content and connotations of right to life and liberty.
Lenin Bishta, a former Maoist child soldier, was barred from flying to Thailand to participate in a programme in 2018. He moved the SC, saying the Department of Immigration and Ministry of Home Affairs had curtailed his fundamental rights to travel freely. Recently, the apex court unveiled the judgement. Interestingly, almost similar thing had happened in India in late 1970s.
In India, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Maneka Gandhi’s passport was impounded by the central government under Passport Act in the interest of general public. Maneka filed a writ petition challenging the order on the ground of violation of her fundamental rights in Article 21 (Right to life and liberty). Justice Krishna Iyer in the case of Maneka Gandhi v Union of India (1978) held that the spirit of man is at the root of Article 21: personal liberty makes for the worth of human person and right to travel makes liberty worthwhile.
No person can be deprived of his right to go abroad except according to procedure established by law.
Thus, no person can be deprived of his right to go abroad except according to procedure established by law. However, Justice PN Bhagwati (in Maneka Gandhi case itself) observed that the principle of reasonableness which legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades right to equality like a brooding omnipresence. Thus, the procedure adopted by the government must be just, fair and reasonable and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive, otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of due process would not be satisfied.
In Unites States, the US Supreme Court in the landmark case of Munn v Illinois (1877) explains the concept of ‘life and liberty’ and the 5th and 14th amendment to the US Constitution in these words: “By the term ‘life’ as here used, something more is meant than mere animal existence. The inhibition against its deprivation extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. The provision equally prohibits the mutilation of the body by the amputation of an arm or leg…..” Again in 1958, Justice William O Douglas in the case of Kent v Dulles (US SC) held that freedom to go abroad has much value and represents the basic rights of great significance.
Now, from the rulings of the superior courts of Nepal, India or US, it becomes clear that the concept of human rights protects individuals from the excess of the state. In fact, the concept of human rights can be traced to the natural law philosophers, such as Locke and Rousseau. The natural law philosophers philosophized over such inherent human rights and sought to preserve these rights by propounding the theory of social contract.
According to Locke, man is born “with a title to perfect freedom and an uncontrolled enjoyment of all the rights and privileges of law of nature and he has by nature a power to preserve his property—that is, his life, liberty and estate, against the injuries and attempts of other men.”
MP Jain, an acclaimed commentator of Constitutional Law, in his book Indian Constitutional Law argues that the Declaration of the French Revolution, 1789, which may be regarded as a concrete political statement on Human Rights and which was inspired by LOCKEIAN philosophy declared: The aim of all political association is the conservation of the natural and inalienable rights of man.
From the pronouncement made in Lenin Bishta’s case, it becomes crystal clear that in a democratic country, a citizen is allowed to remain free until and unless arrested under the law and is subject at all times to the right to move or travel.  The significance of the pronouncement is two-fold. One, the bench presided by Mr Justice Dr Anand Mohan Bhattarai clarified that right to travel abroad cannot take a back seat in Nepal.
Lenin Bista
The ruling is a complete endorsement of right to liberty of the citizen in a republic and against arbitrary action of the government. Two, the ruling clarifies that the fundamental freedoms embodied under Article 17, right to life and liberty in Article 16 and right to equality enshrined under Article 18 are not mutually exclusive but they sustain, strengthen and nourish each other.
In fact, a prudent man thinks that the right to life includes right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessities of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing, and shelter over the head and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings, held Justice PN Bhagwati in the groundbreaking verdict of Francis Coralie v NCT of Delhi (AIR 1981).
The re-embodiment of right to life and liberty, which Lenin Bistha’s case brought about would exert a deep impact on contemporary constitutional jurisprudence and the subordinate courts or the highest court itself could dispense creative judgements in the days to come on the heels of this case which has succeeded an inch to expand the substantive as well as procedural aspect of right to life and liberty.
Above all this, the implementation of the ruling of the apex court made in Lenin Bistha will certainly be a step ahead in right direction in practical realization of the right to life and liberty clause embodied under Article 16 of the 2015 Constitution of Nepal.

Kathmandu, 17 July (2020) – Independent analyst and Nepal-China relationship expert Dr. Rajiv Jha said that the current NCP standoff will not end if the resignation of PM KP Sharma Oli is sought in every pretext.
He said that NCP needs to pay attention to the fight against coronavirus taking support from the opposition but top NCP brass has engaged itself in regime change and this has made Nepal’s well-wishers worried.
Jha said, “If the current imbroglio in the NCP is to gain power or is done at others’ behest, it will spell disaster not only for the NCP but also for the country.”
He suggests NCP leaders to use their strength in economic revival of the country at a time when the nation is severely affected by corona pandemic and floods.
“History shows that communist parties have gained power but have subsequently split in many groups to meet their end. At a time when communist revolution is inactive across the world, China and other countries that believe in socialism wish well for NCP which has been leading the government with almost two-thirds majority,” Dr. Jha said.
He worries that the current conflict in the NCP can change the political course. “In 1994 Nepali Congress party announced flash elections even if it had secured comfortable majority. This move changed the country’s political course, leading to instability,” he says. “People are seeking development and stability now and NCP’s responsible leaders need to ensure that the same thing does not recur.”
He comments that most of the communist prime ministers in Nepal promote their own family and people feel that these leaders’ working style is not free from criticism.
“If the current problem has risen due to the working style of a person, the party should decide upon inducting new members in the Secretariat,” Dr. Jha said.
He said that NCP leaders should stand together and ensure distribution of responsibilities for the sake of safe future of the party. “Otherwise neither NCP gets safe passage, nor the people enjoy development,” Dr. Jha said.

The issuing of revised map incorporating lands up to Limpiyadhura followed by the amendment of the constitution inspired people to adulate PM KP Sharma Oli as an audacious and “nationalist” leader for the second time. First time he received such accolades was when he took firm stance during the Indian blockade of 2015 that had rewarded his party with almost two-third majority in the last election.
On the flip side, there is a high probability that a nationalist leader will incline toward jingoism. While KP Oli’s real nationalist image could be separately debated, his recent unconscionable and extreme statements prove him an ultra-nationalist.
Owing to the overconfident and bigotry-filled statements, he has often been labelled as autocratic in social media. And now he is in the path of chauvinism because of his series of extreme statements targeting the most closed neighbour. But we cannot endure next Hitler or an autocrat in the name of stable government.
Recently he made a statement, “Lord Ram and his birthplace Ayodhya belong to Nepal, and India has faked the birthplace.” He stated this perhaps to gain some brownie points in national politics but it only adulterated the long-held friendly relationship between two countries.
Several controversial remarks, unverified claims and flippant assertions from PM Oli has long been noticed in domestic affairs. However, his unfettered remarks are gradually transcending the limit because the recent one is sure to jeopardize the international diplomatic relationship.
“India is making ploy to oust my government”- his earlier statement was not only criticised in the public sphere but it also steered his party to the brink of splitting. Since there was already discontent among the party cadres, this blatant statement accelerated the internal conflict. Consequently, his own party leaders sought his resignation from both the posts: Prime Minister and Chairman.
“The virus from India side is more lethal than from China”- his unwarranted claim appeared in the midst of pandemic few months back. This statement incensed Indian news channels which were already casting aspersions against Nepal with fictitious arguments about the border issue.
Is Oli playing politics deliberately with such remarks? Is there any possibility that he wants to change the political discourse in another direction to conceal his incapability in handling Covid-19 ? Or is it only the outcome of his loose tongue?
Anything can happen in politics because politicians are apt in doing things that normal people can’t easily understand. Whatever the reasons, Oli shouldn’t make flippant comments targeting India. Here are few reasons why.
Loss of nationalist image
Oli was once acclaimed as a nationalist owing to the stance he took during the blockade from the Indian side. Some people argue that it requires separate intellectual debate because there were no diplomatic efforts from Oli’s side to end the blockade then while people endured hardships. However, it is one of the primary reasons that he steered the political course in his favour through elections. And now his nationalist image is about to wane because of his offensive and controversial remarks.
It takes hard time to gain public belief but a single blunder will destroy the popularity in an instant. There will be no reason to trust the PM if he frequently makes false statements and flippant remarks over serious issues. People expect responsible and balanced opinion from the head of government. In addition, why shouldn’t people deem our PM as ultra-nationalist when he cherishes in advancing polemics that could interfere into the long-held bilateral understanding?
Putting the issue of LLK in jeopardy
The amendment in the constitution to include the lands of Lipulekh-Limpiyadhura-Kalapani in Nepal’s Map was highly acclaimed by Nepali people. However, this action has neither solved the border issue nor guaranteed that those lands will be returned to Nepal. It is a bilateral issue and should be resolved only through diplomatic talks in cordial and healthy environment.
Oli’s recent statements will only muddy the atmosphere of diplomatic dialogues between two countries. We cannot expect fruitful political dialogue any soon because of his irresponsible assertions. Even if we may have strong evidences regarding disputed lands, the chances of getting them back is becoming slimmer.
Furthermore, it was almost apparent that India has deliberately delayed the dialogue over the border issue. Previously formed secretary level mechanism was expected to work actively but it turned out to be only a formality, especially due to lack of interest from the Indian side. Therefore, it requires responsible and practical approach from Nepal’s side to settle this problem.
The PM’s recent statements only lead to an incitement that may influence the long-held relationship between the citizens. This is because Nepal and India share a unique relationship of friendship and cooperation characterised by open borders and deep-rooted people-to-people contacts of kinship and culture.

Current crisis management could be affected
At a time when Nepal is striving to contain the infection with limited resources, our government should not waste time in other issues at least for some time. This is because there are several crucial actions needed to be done shortly.
First, the improvement of unhygienic and unscientific quarantines is overdue. Second, it is reported time and again that the collected swab samples have been left untested for long because of limited kits. Clearly, the need of broadening the tests has soared. Third, practical preparedness and plans are required because the currently relaxed lockdown is sure to augment infection rate. Furthermore, the wrecked economy has hit every sector for which the mitigating and relief programmes are expected as soon as possible. When KP Oli throws controversial remarks, Nepal’s political environment is disturbed which could also affect the working atmosphere of government.
Nepali politics has long endured Oli’s flippant and irresponsible statements and the trend didn’t stop even during the pandemic. Whether about the issue of immunity power or the chemical composition of novel coronavirus, he was criticized frequently. Despite this, he loves to make controversial remarks and recent statements have transcended the limits.
Why does he love to present unverified statements? Does he seek suggestions and comments from advisors and experts before making such claims? His statements prove that he doesn’t.
Leaders may differ the style how they present their views and opinions. But those who hold the responsible post should understand the importance of their words. Statement of ministers and the PM is the official opinion. PM Oli should stop spouting superficial and controversial speeches and should seek the experts’ advice before making any claim on serious issues. Also, he should change his teams if they are feeding him misinformation or not doing their works honestly.
