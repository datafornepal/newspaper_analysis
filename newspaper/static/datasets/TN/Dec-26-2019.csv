Upadfhyaya: Kathmandu: Nepal as a nation-state is alive only due to the strong presence of robust Nepali nationalists who more often than not oppose India’s continued hegemony associated with land encroachment.
Rough estimates have it that India born 1947 has as of now gulped five Vatican size Nepali landmass and unfortunately back home the ruling elites celebrate such encroachments by the Indian side for some mysterious political reasons.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Some say the celebration could be that the present system in force in the country- the India tortured and pained one-has been a gift from the Indian establishment of the India sponsored Nepal movement of the year 2005-6.
Staunch nationalists even claim that Shyam Saran, one naughty Indian diplomatic-brain, remained instrumental in the overthrow of the Nepali monarchy through the extensive use of Comrade Prachanda and Dr. Babu Ram Bhattarai who were then residing in Delhi enjoying the Indian government’s hospitality associated with needed security.
Girija Prasad Koirala helped the two Maoists leaders who were in Delhi then to pounce upon Nepal-their own country of birth unfortunately.
Late Koirala wished to become the first Nepal President of the Gifted Republic, critics claim.
“This automatically means that Prachanda and Dr. Bhattarai could still be the “trusted and tested” men of the Indian establishment” says a source who has been watching Saran’s “intimate” connections with the two heroes and builders of Nepal that is Prachanda and Dr. BR Bhattarai.
Under instructions, it is widely believed the two NOIDA veterans are housed in two different political camps.
Saran’s critics also hint that this Indian diplomat has posted several “paid moles” in Nepal who have direct links with the ruling elites and it is these domestic infiltrators who later pass on the national secrets to India through Shyam Saran.
However, this grave allegation remains yet to be substantiated.

In the meantime, some noted border experts, geographers and researchers have vowed to bring out a new map of Nepal which depicts (and includes) all the landmass that has as of now been swallowed by the declared South Asian hegemon (India).
The new map of Nepal is to be released soon which shall include the Nepali land of SUSTA that has been mercilessly eaten up by the regional Expansionist-India, so declared a noted geographer Kamal Chandra Baral, writes the Annapurna daily dated December 25, 2019.
The new Nepali map is being prepared and released by “Save the Nepali Border” campaign.
Sources close to the Save the Nepal Border” campaign hope that the new released map will be circulated nationwide and shall also be taught in the schools so that the school going students understand as to how the neighboring India with “ROTI-BETI” relations has eaten up the Nepali soil from Taplejung to Darchula.

Hardly had the election results declared in Sri Lanka, the bigot Hindu card holder and the forcefully raised Indian foreign minister S. Jay Shankar rushed to greet the newly elected President Gotabaya Rajapaksha to ensure that the new President may not drift towards
The standard Indian habit is teasing and harassing the smaller neighbors. Nepal is the weakest of it all.

To recall, the Tamil Tigers have had initiated a secessionist movement in the Island nation which was clearly sponsored and funded by the Indian regime.
It was the brain child of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, matured political observers of South Asia opine.
Talking to this scribe at the end of the nineties in Kathmandu Annapurna Hotel, the retired Indian Foreign Secretary late J. N. Dixit had admitted that sending of the Indian Peace Keeping Force-the IPKF to Sri Lanka was India’s Himalayan blunder. This he has also stated in his voluminous book My South Block Years.
To recall, one Navy young man in Colombo most convincingly hit the visiting Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
That was the Sri Lankan anger exhibited towards India.
However, the three decades long separatist movement carried by the LTTE men headed by India preferred and encouraged dreaded Vellai Prabhakaran came to an end as back as in 2009.
A press conference was hurriedly summoned in 2009 by Sri Lankan Ambassador Hewage to announce that the LTTE menace has been eliminated from the Sri Lankan landscape once and for all.
The Sri Lankan envoy that evening in Annapurna Hotel was beaming for some understandable reasons. His excitement was real.
The entire credit for the elimination of the dangerous separatists from the political scene goes to the then Sri Lankan top leadership headed by President Mahinda Rajpaksha and his defense secretary Gotabaya Rajpaksha.
Thanks Pakistan and China’s “moral” support that this LTTE menace was wiped out.
Though the Tamil terror came to an abrupt end, however, with the sudden landing of the Indian minister Shankar to Colombo a fortnight ago does hint that the Indian minister was in Sri Lanka to impress upon President Gotabaya to award due attention and special rights to the Tamils of the Indian origin or else the Island nation may have to face the same fate as had been in the past decades.
Despite the Indian pressure at the moment, let’s presume Gotabaya is not bowing to the Indian dictates as the India indoctrinated and trained Nepali leaders have been doing since the early months of 2006.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Some declared Indian stooges have been entertaining the Chinese officials in Kathmandu.
An Indian ploy perhaps. Raw “nexus” against China has suddenly become active with the arrival of Shyam Saran a month back.
However, President Gotabaya assured Minister Shankar during the meet that he would be the President “even of those who did not vote for him” during the just held polls.
The Tamils perhaps do not yet favor Gotabaya as per the “designs” of the Indian regime.
Minister Shankar was quick enough to extend invitation to the new President to visit India and while writing this story, the Sri Lankan President has already visited India where PM Modi requested President Gotabaya to devolve power to the Tamils of Sri Lanka.
President apparently is not in a mood to act as per the Indian preferences.
As was expected and warranted, Pakistan’s foreign minister M. Qureshi was already in Sri Lanka and extended a formal invitation to President Gotabaya to visit Pakistan at his convenience. FM Qureshi by this time has already returned to his home country.
In doing so, Pakistan has taken a timely political step that will balance the South Asian politics in many more ways than one.
Interestingly, Pakistan also was quick enough to congratulate Gotabaya Rajapaksa on his victory, like India, and expressed the hope that the new dispensation in Colombo would reverse some of the earlier decisions vis-à-vis Pakistan ( on Kashmir perhaps) according to people aware of the matter.
PM Khan talked over phone with the new Sri Lankan President immediately after the election results.
To recall, the newly elected Sri Lankan President has obtained his military training in Pakistan.
If and when the Sri Lankan President Gotabaya visits Pakistan, he will do so only to reinforce his political commitment that he will follow a policy of equidistance while dealing with the important neighbors in the region.
This also means that even if Gotabaya visited India first but yet this should not mean that he will ignore China and by extension with Pakistan.
The fact is also that President Gotabaya can’t afford to ignore China for multiple reasons and also recalling Colombo’s ties with Beijing in the past.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

In fact, his policy of equidistance means that he will do justice with China as well though he has visited India first under pressure from the known hegemon.
Unsubstantiated rumors have it that the politically strong Rajpaksha brothers prefer China over India for reasons unknown to many political observers but known to those who have specialized on SA politics.
It could be the compulsion of Sri Lanka to counter the Indian hegemony and thus they need Chinese help and have every valid reasons to inch closer to China.
Qureshi has met his Sri Lankan counterpart Dinesh Gunawardena this Monday in Colombo.
This has then set the tone for the visit of President Gotabaya to Pakistan to be followed by China or vice versa.
Let’s hope that China’s foreign Minister Wang Yi lands in Colombo much the same way the Indian minister landed there close on the heels of the declaration of the Sri Lankan election results.
Minister Wang’s Colombo trip as and when it materializes would send appropriate signals to the places where it should approach.
Needless to say, Indian minister Shankar’s visit to Colombo gets neutralized by the visit of the Pakistani foreign Minister Qureshi who is currently in Sri Lanka for a two day visit.
FM Qureshi’s talks with the Sri Lanka counterpart Dinesh Gunawardena is expected to keep the South Asian politics rolling in a better direction as both favor the revival of the India killed SAARC-the regional organization.
President Gotabaya has already made it clear that he will do all he can in order to revive the SAARC body.
With Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and now Sri Lanka ready for the revival of the dead SAARC, India now can do little to object to the majority of the voice from the regional countries that favor the revitalization of the regional body.
If Nepal is the current Chair then it is the turn of Pakistan to hold the stalled Summit of the SAARC. Pakistan must step up its activities in this regards. He is most welcome in Nepal.
To sum up, Sri Lanka and Pakistan being the two powerful countries of the South Asian region have no other option than to increase their “bilateral understanding” in order to keep not only the region safe but also to counter the Indian highhandedness which has terrified the smaller nations that unfortunately share their borders with the goliath.
This they can do through SAARC and other international organizations for the betterment of the South Asian region.
To sum up, the foreign ministers of Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka should travel in the region and lobby for the revival of the SAARC body and enhancing bilateral ties.
This will send the needed political signals where it is needed most.
Thus Pakistan’s foreign Minister Qureshi’s current trip to Colombo has significant political connotations of sort. Its meaning will have greater meaning when the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi visits Sri Lanka and adds to the strength of the Pak-Sri Lanka ties.
FM Qureshi in Colombo talked on Kashmir with the Sri Lankan media. He also briefed the media on regional developments.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said Pakistan and Sri Lanka enjoy longstanding and strong bilateral relations.
Issues confronting South Asia in the recent months were discussed when Qureshi met his counterpart in Colombo on Monday.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“FM Qureshi also briefed his Sri Lankan counterpart on the dire situation and human rights crisis” in Jammu and Kashmir”, news sources said.
FM Qureshi on behalf of Pakistan extended invitation to the Sri Lankan President and also to the Prime Minister.
The Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the Colombo page reported December 2, sought Pakistan’s assistance to boost bilateral trade and eradicate the drug menace plaguing his country when met Pakistan’s Foreign Affairs Minister Shad Mahmood Qureshi on Monday in Colombo.
“Drug trafficking and addiction is a grave evil that my country is confronted with. We wish to seek Pakistan’s assistance to eradicate this menace,” the SL President said.
An expanded Colombo-Islamabad friendship definitely will act like a political deterrent in South Asia, the regional observers hope.
Will these three countries work in this direction? They have to if South Asia is to be kept safe from the malevolent design of the Indian establishment.
China knows it better.
To sum up, the two south Asian neighbors and members of the SAARC body exchanged views on the entire gamut of bilateral relations and matters pertaining to regional and international issues which is a good development for the region.
In addition, the Pak FM Qureshi while meeting Dinesh Gunwerdene said that the two countries having held longstanding trade ties need to reach a higher level of economic cooperation, which at present has not been fully optimized and there is much potential for economic linkages to be strengthened. He highlighted that Sri Lanka is presently not fully utilizing its credit line of USD 200 million with Pakistan and invited Sri Lanka to make use of the opportunity, especially in the animal husbandry area, which would be beneficial for the country.
Minister Gunawardena lauded his appreciation for Pakistan’s partnership in multifaceted cooperation including the steadfast support for the country’s development process.
The Minister stated that this visit is the first to be made of a Foreign Minister to Sri Lanka following the formation of the Cabinet, after the election of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
Minister Gunawardena informed his counterpart that Sri Lanka was committed to continuing the bilateral partnership in all possible areas of cooperation and looked forward to engaging in the fields of tourism and higher education, in addition to the growing bilateral economic partnership.
A great disaster was averted in that the previous Sri Lankan PM Wickremesinghe was so close to India that his attitude towards Pakistan remained damn cold.
Had Sajith Premadasa won the election, it would have been a disaster for Pakistan,” a South Asian diplomatic source said as claimed by the Economic Times dated November 19/19.
The Economic Times further writes that as a young army officer in the early 1970s, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was sent to Pakistan for an officers’ training course at a time when Sri Lanka maintained strong relations with Pakistan.
Later, during the war with the LTTE, when he was the defence secretary under his brother Mahinda’s presidency, Pakistan military supported the Sri Lankan army.
To conclude, it may be recalled that during the 1971 unrest that led to the creation of Bangladesh, after India withdrew landing and overflight rights to Pakistan, Sri Lanka granted refueling facilities to Pakistan International Airlines. This very much speaks of the close ties of the two South Asian nations.
That the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has not wasted time become evident in that he has already met with Wu Jianghao, the Special Representative of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China and Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
“I was pleased to meet with the Special Representative of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China and Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Mr Wu Jianghao and had cordial discussions on China-LKA relations,” the Sri Lankan President tweeted.
The ground reality is that Sri Lanka’s deep ties with China in recent years is, arguably, a consequence of how the Tamil question played out between Colombo and Delhi.
Successive coalition governments in Delhi from 1989 to 2014, which were dependent on the support of the Tamil parties, struggled to balance the pulls and pressures from Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, and Colombo.
Needless to say, Delhi fell between the two stools. Its intervention deeply angered the majority Sinhala community. And the sense of threat from India nudged Sri Lanka to turn to China and Pakistan to balance against its northern neighbor, writes veteran Indian journalist C Raja Mohan in his fresh article December 1/19.
And in fact it was Delhi’s intervention on issues related with the Tamils that Colombo had to make a drift towards Beijing, claim Nepali observers.
This meet with the high Chinese functionary has meaning underneath.
Lastly but importantly, it is no coincidence that President Gotabaya’s inauguration ceremony occurred at an ancient temple built by Sinhalese King Dutugemenu—who is best known for defeating an invading Tamil king from the Chola kingdom.
Has this some meaning underneath? Keep on guessing.
It is time when Delhi will for sure press Colombo to inch closer to it. However, how to balance the ties between a hegemon and a partner in development, China, should be at best be decided by President Gotabaya and his team of seasoned leaders.
Yet for the time being China-Pakistan-Sri Lanka must enhance their ties which could be the desired political deterrent to the India’s regional hegemony in South Asia. What Colombo decides should be final though. Question is: has Colombo the political stamina in keeping Delhi at a comfortable distance sans Beijing or for that matter Pakistan’s help?

String of Pearls: 
For the Road However, the Sri Lankan president’s comments after his meeting with Modi have raised concerns about how the new regime will handle the question of the country’s Tamil minority. Rajapaksa made it clear in an interview to the Hindu that devolving political rights to the Tamil-dominated areas will not be his priority. Rather, he will focus on the regions’ economic development, reports the Scroll.in December 5, 2019.  This hints that Delhi awaits a set back from Colombo. And whether the much publicized String of pearls already in existence?  Or it is in the making? That’s all.  ",/analysis,"Thu, 05 Dec 2019 17:52:34 +0000"
2,http://telegraphnepal.com/ignoring-international-pressure-india-continues-kashmir-genocide/,"Kathmandu: Sweden has very freshly joined the list of European countries that have expressed “serious” concern about the lockdown and communications blackout in Kashmir, with foreign minister Ms. Ann Linde saying “India should lift the remaining restrictions in the region”, the Indian newspaper Hindustan Times reported.
According to a report, Ms. Linde told the Swedish Parliament this Wednesday that the country doesn’t want any escalation of the situation in Kashmir, and that any long-term political solution “must involve Kashmiri inhabitants”.
Linde will be part of the delegation accompanying King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden on a five day state visit to India beginning first week of December/19.
Earlier this month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and later Finland foreign minister Pekka Haavisto too had sternly warned India on Kashmiri lockdown.
To recall, the determined lady of Europe Merkel had said, “The situation for the people there (Kashmir) is currently not sustainable and must improve”.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Merkel’s statement must have jolted the Indian establishment in that the message by Ms. Angela very much favored the Pakistan’s genuine plea made to the world leaders on Kashmir situation.
In fact this is what has been the principled stance of Pakistan since August 5/19-the black day for the imprisoned Kashmiris and its leaders.
Physical chemistry Professor Merkel reiterated her strong stance on Kashmir even when she was the guest of the Indian establishment.
This speaks of her courage.
Similarly, the Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto had said “We are feeling that the situation is not sustainable now and I can see the concerns have been raised by many other international players as well. We are concerned about news that some of the politicians are still in detention or under house arrest. The basic freedoms and freedom of expression of opinion is limited.”
Almost a month have passed of the Finnish statement made on Kashmir, the situation on the ground in the India occupied valley remains even worse as the lockdown continues.
The top leaders of Kashmir are still under house arrest.
Remarkably, the Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto had raised concerns about the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, and had said India should allow United Nations observers and diplomatic missions to visit the region to get first-hand experience, Indian media had reported.
Haavisto then said that the unofficial delegation of members of the European Union which visited Jammu and Kashmir last month was not a politically-balanced team.
“I don’t want to criticize if anyone is travelling and reporting about the situation in Kashmir, but it is good if people who have expertise about the situation in this region or on human rights, freedom of the media issues etc are involved,” he had told the Indian media while being in India on a formal visit.
The fresh Swedish remarks on Kashmir is important because the Swedish King is travelling to India very shortly for a week or so and it is widely believed that the Swedish delegation will raise the Kashmir issue during the bilateral level talks with India.
Writes the Swedish Professor Ashok Swain in the Gulf News dated November 28/19 that, “It is difficult to believe that Sweden is unaware of the fact that under PM Modi India since 2014 is witnessing growing intolerance and increased incidences of violence against the Indian minorities”.
The Swedish Professor of Indian origin Mr. Swain further writes that “for its credibility, Sweden should walk the talk. It is thus important for the King and the accompanying delegation in this State visit to bring up issues like tolerance, human rights and minority issues in their private and public interactions with the Indian political establishment”.
However, Professor Swain fears that the Swedish delegation may waste precious time only in talking (business) on the likely SAAB-gripen fighter aircraft deal with India and in the process may deviate from raising its voice against suppression of democratic values in India and human rights in Kashmir.
If that happens then that would be a disaster and the minority Muslims in India (Kashmir implied) will conclude that for Sweden commercial business is supreme as against preservation of human values.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

It would also mean that Sweden endorses “Indian intolerance” against the minority Muslims and Dalits.
However, listening to the Swedish minister Linda’s talk on Kashmir in the Swedish parliament, observers in South Asia, with Nepal included definitely, believe that Sweden will reiterate the same to what had been stated in the Swedish parliament a few days ago.
Foreign Minister Linda had stated in the parliament that her country doesn’t want any escalation of the situation in Kashmir, and that any long-term political solution “must involve Kashmiri inhabitants”.
The message to India is clear which is most likely to be forcefully repeated during the impending Swedish delegation New Delhi state visit.
In the meantime, the United States recently warned Pakistan of the long-term risks to its economy if it embraces China’s massive infrastructure project and suggested that it should instead look to the U.S. business model.
To recall, Pakistan and China are engaged in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Project, CPEC, which constitutes to be a part of the Belt and Road Initiative-a signature plan of President Xi Jinping.
Alice Wells, the acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told a conference on November 21 that the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will only profit Beijing.
This is what the US thinks of the BRI and the CPEC. However, China and Pakistan do not subscribe to the theory advanced by the US and some European Nations.
Needless to say, in Nepal also a small section subscribe to this debt trap notion as is being forcefully claimed by the US and India sponsored intellectuals.
The United States and many EU countries have criticized China’s project and it’s lending for regional infrastructure efforts, warning that it has saddled some developing countries with debts that they cannot afford to repay time permitting.
Now the likely target would surely be Sri Lanka as the return of Rajpaksha brothers in Sri Lankan politics will allow China to inch closer to Colombo.
(Though President Gotabaya has talked on Colombo-Delhi ties but yet his likely visit to China and later to Pakistan will set the impending political attitude of South Asia).
The abject failure of India’s neighborhood policy will certainly benefit China.
The CPEC project in Pakistan consists of rail, road, and energy infrastructure and is part of the wider $1 trillion Chinese project known as the “Belt and Road” initiative.
Interestingly leaving all and sundry in a big surprise, the sitting US Ambassador to Pakistan November 25, 2019, categorically stated that the remarks on CPEC made by the US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, November 21/19 were meant to generate debate however it was Pakistan’s sovereign right to decide its future.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“We do not expect everyone to agree with us or agree with every aspect of her speech,” Ambassador of the United States of America Paul W Jones said while talking to media after visiting Wazir Khan Mosque to review the ongoing restoration work of some historic houses under the ‘US Ambassador’s Fund for Cultural Preservation’ (AFCP), reports the APP.
This means that the US will not mind if Pakistan engages itself with the Chinese projects but would only advise Pakistan to take steps ahead with utmost care.
Not bad indeed as is evident from the US envoy talks made in Lahore.
The Ambassador when asked about the statement made by US Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Alice Wells gave in Washington D.C about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), said it was very ‘thoughtful speech’, and added that the idea of her speech was to generate debate.
The news that remained largely ignored was that Alice Well also stated that the United States has plans to send 15 trade delegations to Pakistan in the year 2020.
“The U.S. Commerce Department has already stepped up its activity in Pakistan with 15 trade delegations planned for the next year. And once the new expanded Development Finance Corporation or DFC is stood up, Pakistan is going to be a country of great interest,” stated a paper Wells read at a Washington think-tank, Wilson Centre, last week.
During the same think tank gathering Alice Well had made sharp comments on CPEC.
This means that the US doesn’t have any nefarious plans to harass its longtime ally now forgotten albeit.
The US is aware of the fact that Pakistan could play an important role in ensuring peace in Afghanistan to which Pakistan is fully committed.
Notably the Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi asserted as back as on November 24/19 that the recently aired US views on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will have “no impact” on the ambitious project, after a senior Trump administration official (Alice Wells) warned Islamabad that the project would take a toll on the cash-strapped country’s economy.
In the meantime, the Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang in a regular Press Conference held on November 25, 2019 said that China and Pakistan have clarified and refuted such smears time and again. However, some in the US still use the same old script and do the same old plots.
All said and done, speaking to an audience at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars on November 21/19 Alice Wells, acting assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs, had said that the U.S. offered a better model that would improve the fundamentals of Pakistan’s troubled economy. She also had convincingly raised questions about the transparency and fairness of CPEC projects as well as related Chinese loans Islamabad has received.
Adding adequate strength to his nation’s stance on CPEC, the senate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mushahid Hussain described the allegations by Alice Wells as disappointing ones.
Journalist turned politician Mr. Hussain noted that CPEC has ensured energy security for Pakistan and set the stage for an “industrial revolution” in the next stage of the massive project, which is already in progress.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“CPEC is central to Pakistan’s future and it’s a pivot of our strategic relationship with China and for which Pakistan has benefited already. We feel she had got her facts mixed up because of unfounded media reports, opined Hussain.
In a fresh move Pakistan’s Minister of Planning, Development and Reform Asad Umar said on November 29/19 that the government was increasing focus on the development of special economic zones (SEZs) under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to accelerate industrialization and job creation in the country, writes the China.org.com in its fresh reporting.
The government is expected to perform the groundbreaking of the first special economic zone under CPEC by the end of December, the minister said, adding that another two SEZs will be open within the current fiscal year, the Chinese news agency further writes.
This is sure to generate employment for the Pakistani youths.
Advisor to Prime Minister on Finance Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh said that the ultimate success of Pakistan China Economic Corridor (CPEC) would only be possible with the participation of more countries for becoming part of this important project.
“With participation of other countries the cooperation of CPEC between China and Pakistan would become more beneficial
All said and done, but yet the question need to be asked: Is China transparent? Will China assure countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal that its support today will not be a debt trap for these countries tomorrow? China better clarifies its real intent whatever it is?
It is in the greater interest of China to put the facts straight and end the continued debate.
Finally, Pakistan would do well if it takes the US advice in a good spirit. Being alert is not that bad than to weep later.

3,http://telegraphnepal.com/kalapani-the-nepal-india-end-game/,"N.P. Upadhyaya, Kathmandu: All the presumed yes men of the Indian Union born 1947 have surprisingly made it a point to harass and embarrass the incumbent Prime Minister KP Oli.
It is this flock of the ‘Yes sir Ok Sir men’ who have been disseminating all the rubbish against the radical communist government controlled by KP Sharma Oli.
However, this is not to certify that PM Oli is a sacrosanct political persona on questions of the degree of the inclination that he has for the health and the happiness for the Indian establishment.
No he is not.
To be honest, PM Oli has been kind enough and had remained excessively liberal for ensuring and securing political benefits for India even if that be at the cost of his own “motherland”-Nepal.
To put it modestly, the incumbent Prime Minister Oli was the one who left no stones unturned to handover the mighty Mahakali River to the Indian establishment in the mid-nineties.
Oli’s excitement observed during the Mahakali Treaty ratification (for India) was pretty “nation” insulting enough to dub KP Oli as to have surrendered to the Indian Union for some gains albeit political ones.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

However, it was this Oli’s excitement which later was honored by the enemy-friend across the border in that Oli who had been suffering from chronic renal problems was instantly invited by the Indian establishment for a free renal treatment at the Medanta Hospital in New Delhi.
He went to this Delhi clinic several times in the past and returned beamingly.
PM’s renal issues have compounded these days more so after he dropped visiting New Delhi. In addition he is suffering from Appendicitis.
But yet PM Oli with a very heavy heart (let’s presume it to have been so) sent warning signals to India.
He said, “The government will not allow anybody to encroach even one inch of its land. The neighboring country should take its Army back from our territory.”
PM Oli further said in a bold fashion that ““It will remove the foreign troops. We have achieved national unity over this issue now.”
Nepal Government maintains:

Nepal objects to the inclusion of Kalapani within Indian Territory
 Nepal government has made it clear that Kalapani is an integral part of the country.
The inclusion of Kalapani into the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand is objectionable for Nepal.
Nepal’s political parties have now a united stand on Kalapani which rightly claims that Kalapani is a Nepali territory since ages.

 
How can Oli-an India trusted man of the not so distant past can challenge India? The question remains valid.
Nepal PM Oli has freshly vowed that even if India topples his government, he will fight with India to the hilt to take kalapani back.
Medanta hospital roars?
What if Prachanda is lured by father Shyam Saran? 




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

By the way, Mr. Madhav Kumar Nepal, then a top ranking UML leader, also enjoyed the Delhi largesse in that even if election-defeated, Mr. Nepal was made Nepal’s Prime Minister.
This defeated Nepal ruled the nation for as good as nine months at a stretch. Thanks New Delhi.
On top of it all, it was in the rumor then that for having assisted Delhi in securing the Mahakali river ratification from Nepal’s India controlled Parliament in India’s favor, Mr. Nepal’s illustrious daughter was awarded with a MBBS free scholarship from the Indian government.
To recall, after Oli it was Mr. Madhav Kumar Nepal who played several tricks in securing the Mahakali river water and electric power to India.
Mr. Nepal in the early 90s even was thinking the invasion of Nepal by the Indian military. However, Mr. Nepal’s inner desires failed for some exclusive reasons. But he may have been thinking even as of now? Is he?
Finally, Oli and Mr. Nepal’s plus efforts brought immense benefits for New Delhi and as is the horrifying rumor these days, it is these two illustrious Nepali leaders from the “good-for-nothing” communist party who even today enjoy the same level of blessings from the Delhi master-rulers who also run Nepal thorough undeclared decree.
Shri Kamal Koirala, a veteran UML-Communist leader and the one who served Nepal in South Korea as Ambassador very recently claimed that PM Oli can’t be taken as a nationalist who has awarded the Indian establishment with plum natural resources (at a dirt cheap price or even for free at times).
“Oli thus can’t claim himself as a true Nepali nationalist”, said Koirala who appears frustrated with the current dispensation under PM Oli.
Mr. Koirala is against his own party stalwart(s) who had made him Ambassador to Korea.
Mr. Koirala is the son of late Matrika Prasad Koirala who possibly allowed the Indian military men the free entry into what is Kalapani-Limpiyadhura-the Nepali landmass which India has forcibly gulped and duly incorporated in the new map released by the enemy-neighbor-India.
Late MP Koirala is also accused of gifting Koshi River to India. And BP koirala handed over the Gandak River to India, it is said.
One doubts if India is a neighbor or a most disgusting enemy across the border?
A section of the Nepali media together with some perverted political brains accuse late King Mahendra to have facilitated the Indian army to remain in the Kalapani area when the Indians were fighting a fatal war with the mighty Chinese regime in the early 60s.
The war went in favor of China but yet the Indian army preferred to continue their stay in Kalapani area as this place was considered strategically important for fighting with the Chinese on the other side of the border.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Now that India has swallowed Nepali landmass and claims that the territory belongs to India which means that India is going against the boundary set by the Nepal-British India company treaty signed in 1816.
If India rejects to honor the Sugauli Treaty then Nepal has every right as per the Nepal-India friendship Treaty of 1950 (Article 8) to demand the territories occupied by Nepal prior to signing of the Sugauli Treaty which goes as far as Kumaon and Gadhwal up to Sutlej in the West and River Teesta in the East which approaches territories up to almost Bhutan.
Some parts of present day Bangladesh was also a Nepali territory.
The 1950 Treaty gives this right to Nepal to seek its lost territories if India rejects to abide by the treaty of Sugauli.
Ignoring the 1816 Treaty will automatically bring back almost half of the present day Utter Pradesh (UP, India) to the legal jurisdiction of Nepal. Some portions of Bihar State too automatically come to the fold of Nepal.
Nepal had approached and occupied lands up to the Sutlej River.
Not a bad bargain in case if India ignores Nepal’s modest requests.
In the meanwhile, Sher Bahadur Deuba-the President of the sinking Nepali Congress party while talking to his cadres in Pokhara the other day bluntly said that the Indian Prime Minister Modi must have included Kalapani-Limpiyadhura in the newly released Indian map with the “tacit approval” of the Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.
The NC President accuses PM Oli as to have secretly encouraged PM Modi to occupy the Nepali landmass into his country’s new and revised map. Deuba is a top buffoon it is believed.
The ruling party men however, rebuke Deuba’s wild allegations.
By the way, former Indian Ambassador to Nepal Mr. Ranjitey Rae has said that “Had there been Nepali Congress Government in Nepal, China would have not come as closer as it is today”.
This in a more than oblique manner proves that Nepali Congress is a party historically close to New Delhi establishment.
So if Deuba is close then it is not at all a news. And neither is it a matter of shame to Nepali Congress.
As and when NC is in government in Nepal, Indian highhandedness increases. Glaring example is the Shyam saran political change of 2006.
Is China listening?




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

To recall, Deuba is the one who apologized in front of PM Modi that he was not able to amend the Nepali Constitution as per the Indian desires.
Deuba said so during a visit to Delhi some three years back.
Interestingly, Comrade Prachanda, the man who spent ten years in Delhi and enjoyed Indian government’s special care too has begun saying that the Indian move of gulping the Nepali land in the
West is unacceptable and that in doing so India has committed a grave act which goes against the international norms.
Prachanda reportedly is close to Professor SD Muni and Father Shyam Saran. The “nexus” exists even as of now, it is believed.
The RAW top hat Mr. Shyam Saran in his fresh write up has accused Nepali leaders to have ignored the kalapani issue as and when Delhi wished to talk on the same.
What say you PM Oli?
To recall, a few years back, Comrade Prachanda while addressing a Maoists party gathering in Naya Baneshwar had politely suggested the Indian establishment that “No help from India would be the best help from across the border to this country”.
This stands valid even as of today if India, the former British India Colony, takes this million dollar suggestion seriously. In fact, each and every Nepali national who has not sold himself for petty monetary gains will say that let the Nepal-India borders be controlled or even fenced in consultations.
Senior lawyer Swagat Nepal and his “save the nation team” have taken up the Indian dadagiri in a manner that this land grab issue demands. Some of the team members have gone to Kalapani to begin hunger strike. Great nationalists.
In the meanwhile, some Nepali intellectuals have released a new map that has the Kalapani-Limpiyadhura inside the Nepali territory which is what should have been done.
The New map published by Nepal’s learned civil society has timely accomplished this nationalist job for which the members deserve deep appreciations.
Former Nepal Government bureaucrat and a scholar in his own right Dr. Dwarika Nath Dhungel appears to have taken the lead in bringing out a new map as against the Indian map which is largely taken as a cartographic invasion of the Nepali territory by India-the proven enemy neighbor.
Here is the fresh interview clip of Dr. Dhungel with Sagarmatha TV, Nepal.

Needless to say, the Indo-pendent political men and some paid media agents have been talking and disseminating the Indian stance on Kalapani.
In addition, some have been floating the idea that Kalapani be given to India on lease for decades and decades.
Floating of such Nepal insulting ideas must be noted with care.
Thus, in a way the entire Nepali society remains in a tensed but in the same wavelength against India who can go to any extent in securing their owned legal soil if the government fails to bring back the occupied Nepali land.

PM KP Sharma Oli is in a comfortable state to talk straight with PM Modi. PM Oli has already ordered PM Modi to vacate Kalapani area. A diplomatic note as regards this land encroachment issue has been sent to Delhi through diplomatic channels. That’s all.",/analysis,"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 20:54:47 +0000"
4,http://telegraphnepal.com/can-sri-lanka-pakistan-save-south-asia-from-india/,"N. P Upadhyaya, Kathmandu: As if the Kartarpur corridor surprise from Prime Minister Imran Khan to the Indian PM Modi were not enough, most convincingly and fittingly yet another high powered fresh political bang in the vicinity must have disturbed the mental peace of the destructive troika in India (Modi-Doval-Shankar) the moment the Sri Lankan nationals elected Gotabaya Rajpakse as their new President.
The reason is simple in that the Island President prefers China over India which became evident when he stated that his nation shall adhere to the policy of “equidistance” in the conduct of its ties with the countries namely India and China.
Sri Lanka is not a father Shyam Saran tamed Nepal.
Pakistani journalist, Kamran Yousaf, claims in his Twitter account that “Modi government seems jolted by the recent victory of Gotabaya Rajpaksha in Sri Lankan Presidential elections. The new President is pro-China and has strong ties with Pakistan dating back to his army career when he was trained in Pindi and later graduated from Quetta Staff College”.
Perhaps unnerved by “unexpected” Sri Lankan political developments, the Indian regime sent its inferiority complex ridden and the most conservative foreign minister to Colombo in order to keep the new President in good mood.
FM Shankar is hoping against hope hopefully.
But yet for the time being, President Gotabaya is expected not to “allow the island nation to be pulled into a proxy contest among the world’s major powers”, however, analysts foresee a cautious creep towards the pro-Beijing policies of predecessor and brother Mahinda, so writes Bhavan Jaipragas , 18 Nov, 2019.
Honorable Gotabaya perhaps inherits so many political qualities from his respected brother Mahinda Rajpaksha-the present Prime Minister of Sri Lanka who remained all along a strong critique of the regional hegemon-India.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

He had made a good rapport with Pakistan and the Army, to recall.
The Rajapaksas are adored by Sri Lanka’s Sinhalese majority, as well as the powerful Buddhist clergy, for defeating India made Tamil Tiger separatists and ending a 37-year civil war in 2009.
Nepal Maoists too were the creation of the New Delhi establishment. Later they were indoctrinated by Father Shyam Saran who is at the moment in Kathmandu meeting his salaried agents.
Rajapaksa, 70, a former defense official whose brother, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had close ties with Beijing during his 10-year rule, is revered by Sri Lanka’s ethnic majority for his role in ending the civil war.
Elder and younger brother grand combination this. Exemplary.
Mahinda Rajpaksha has the credit of obliterating the LTTE menace from the Sri Lankan political scene a decade back. He did it.
India has allergy with the word “equidistance” for a variety of reasons. To put it bluntly, the regional devil, as India is taken by the civilized countries of South Asia, wants the smaller countries in the neighborhood to treat India as their boss to which the India plagued nations wish to dismiss summarily this Indian ugly wishes.
Save Baby Bhutan and to some extent the Maldives, rest of the India’s neighbors prefer China over India by default.
This marked shift is due to India’s erratic acts.
Nepal PM Oli has very recently challenged India Prime Minister Modi and has told him to take back his military men from Nepal’s Kalapani landmass. First time a Nepali PM has publicly challenged the regional devil.
That Bangladesh too has a deep rooted hatred for India got reflected when the New Delhi based Bangladesh High Commissioner bluntly said the other day that “People of Bangladesh would prefer to swim the Mediterranean and go to Italy than to come to India”.
This explains the extent of abhorrence for India from a country presumed to have been brought into existence by the Indian regime in the early seventies.
The known expansionist Indian lady late Mrs. Indira Gandhi had conspired to bifurcate Pakistan into two halves and thus Bangladesh emerged as a new nation in South Asia.
Reportedly, some key ministers in the present day B’desh cabinet possess immense love and honor for China.
This must have meaning underneath which speaks so many things unspoken.
Indian leadership understands better as to why the South Asians love to hate Indian establishment.
In the meanwhile, according to a Swedish Professor Ashok Swain, India under PM Modi is going backwards on every front: its economy is in a free fall (with growth at a six years low and unemployment at a 45 year high), its polity is becoming authoritarian and its dominant Religion, the Hinduism is growing intolerant”.
This professor further says November 21/19,”Under PM Modi, the Indian Muslims increasingly see themselves as second class citizens”.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

In the same vein, Dr. Claude Rakishit, a strategic analyst and Honorary Associate professor at the Asia-Pacific College of (APCD) says that “Indian Muslims have been at the bottom of the sociology-economic ladder for decades. They are barely accepted by the majority and Modi’s policies will further discriminate against Muslims. The BJP is encouraging Muslim radicalization. The future stability of India is bleak”.
These professors have mentioned the plight of the minority Muslims keeping an eye on the continued predicament of the Kashmiri population in the Indian occupied territory since August 5/19.
The new Sri Lankan President too must work hard to take into full confidence the minorities, such as the Muslims and others. India is likely to fan the Tamils and the Muslims against President Gotabaya.
The India’s elevated FM Shankar has already told President Gotabaya to initiate conciliatory measures with the cornered Tamils.
Gotabaya has stated that he is the President of all the Sri Lankan: those who voted in favor or were against him.
The Indian design is not that encouraging towards the new Colombo regime, it appears.
For a brief period, India was happy that China has been distanced in Sri Lanka during the previous regime, however, with the emergence of President Gotabaya in the Sri Lankan politics, the Indian pain is sure to have doubled for a variety of political reasons.
It is altogether a different matter that the Indian establishment shall begin destabilizing President Gotabaya’s political clout in national politics by encouraging paid RAW agents to create disturbance inside the Island nation so that the incumbent President is forced to seek Indian assistance in taking control of the India created troubles.
Recall the forced entrance of the IPKF-the Indian peace keeping forces in Sri Lanka during the time of President Junious Jayewardene.
Some sort of LTTE phenomenon may be in the cards already. Sri Lanka is hereby warned. India can’t be taken at its face value.
Though the LTTE (the India engineered liberation of Tamil Tigers led by Prabhakaran) has been eliminated a decade back but yet President Gotabaya may have to confront the new version of the LTTE if he keeps himself at a distance with the Indian regime.
The chances can’t be ruled out as is the Nepali experience.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

If New Delhi in advance tried to seduce the newly elected President then Gotabaya too appears to play the hide and seek game with India. He Okayed the Delhi’s invitation and will visit New Delhi and in doing so the new Sri Lankan President did not allow the regional hegemon to suspect his political credentials.
He will be in Delhi November 29/19.
However, the fact is that the Rajpakse illustrious brothers possess sound knowledge on how to take further steps in the region because they know how India creates issues and problems for the smaller countries.
Toeing his brother’s political line, President Gotabaya has taken up a subject that the Indian establishment has developed allergy.
President Gotabaya has in a high sounding voice announced that his country shall work for the revival of the India murdered SAARC-the regional organization which used to bring the smaller nations of South Asia to come closer at least once in a year.
President Gotabaya’s announcement that he will for sure revive the dead SAARC body must have stunned the New Delhi troika and conversely pleased the current SAARC Chair and Pakistan-the next SAARC Chair if the SAARC is revived as promised by Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and very freshly President Gotabaya.
Surprisingly, Bhutan too prefers the revival of the SAARC. Pakistan is very much willing to host the SAARC Summit.
The Sri Lankan President has also twitted as a response to Prime Minister KP Oli’s congratulatory message saying Nepal, being the birthplace of Lord Buddha, holds a special place in Sri Lanka’s hearts.
PM Modi here and there claims that Lord Buddha was born in India, however, he corrects his erratic observations on Lord Buddha as to have been born in Nepal when he is on an uninvited tour to Nepal.
However, with President Gotabaya’s fresh factual declaration on Lord Buddha, PM Modi and his hangers on must have come to senses.
It would not be out of place to appeal the newly elected Sri Lankan President Gotabaya to expedite the existing concept of a South Asian Lord Buddha circuit.
The Circuit though is in existence already but is yet to take a formal shape. The Buddha circuit must come into operation.
The proposed Buddha circuit should begin with Lord Buddha’s birth place in Lumbini and then to India wherein Buddha attained his enlightenment.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

And then the circuit must include Taxila, now in Pakistan and then it should extend up to Afghanistan and ending up in Bhutan.
Hopefully, after peace in Afghanistan institutionalizes after the success of the ongoing Pakistan facilitated Afghan-Taliban-US peace process, the Talibans’ will not harm the Buddhist relics and help restore the hermitages to regain its lost glories.
A fresh news claims that President Trump made separate calls this Thursday to PM Khan and President Ghani days after the Taliban- in exchange for three top Taliban figures-freed American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks in southern Afghanistan.
According to a government statement, Khan “reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the advancement of Afghan peace and reconciliation process for a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.”
For the Buddha circuit to run smoothly, peace in Afghanistan is a must for multiple reasons.
Gandhâra; derived from Sanskrit word “Gandhar”, literally mean “perfumed” is the name of an ancient Kingdom in northern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan.
Gandhara was located mainly in the vale of Peshawar (Pakistan), the Potohar plateau and on the northern side of the Kabul River. Its main cities were Purushapura (modern Peshawar) and Takshashila (Taxila).
Now let’s talk of Sri Lanka in the Buddha circuit.
Theravada Buddhism is the official religion of the majority of Sri Lanka practiced by 70% of Sri Lanka’s population. Practitioners of Buddhism can be found amongst the Sinhalese population as well as the Tamil population. Buddhism has been given the foremost place under Article 9 of the Constitution which can be traced back to an attempt to bring the status of Buddhism back to the status it enjoyed prior to being destroyed by colonialists. However, by virtue of Article 10 of the Sri Lankan constitution, religious rights of all communities are preserved. Sri Lanka is the traditionally oldest religious Buddhist country where Buddhist Aryan culture is protected and preserved. The island has been a center of Buddhist scholarship and learning since the introduction of Buddhism in the third century BCE producing eminent scholars such as Buddhaghosa and preserving the vast Pali canon. (Source Wikipedia).




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

So this completes the Buddha circuit which if becomes a reality time permitting is sure to bring in a real cohesion in the countries and the inhabitants of the South Asian nations.
President Gotabaya must take the regional leaders into confidence. PM Modi may object but he should be ignored by other leaders of the region.
If this circuit takes a formal shape then Myanmar and China also could be added in the second phase.
The idea should be “enhancing friendly ties among the countries linked by Buddha’s teachings”.
Pakistan has very freshly opened several Hindu temples for the Hindu pilgrims inside its territory which is definitely a good news for the Hindus in Nepal. Later a Hindu religion circuit too could be envisioned much the same way as the Kartarpur Road and the Buddha circuit.
President Gotabaya has to take the initiative or else the Indian PM Modi and his destructive Troika will damage the entire scheme.
Interestingly, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan are all closer to China. Bangladesh too has some sympathy for China. In all, China could be a grand player in the region provided China guarantees that it shall never pounce upon the sovereignty of these friendly countries. The question is: Will China assure the smaller South Asian nations who have been threatened by the former British India Company?
Lastly, President Gotabaya is expected to depute his Prime Minister Honorable Mahinda to travel to the SAARC countries and prepare the ground for the convening of the next SAARC Summit in Pakistan.
Nepal and Pakistan and Sri Lanka together with Bhutan then should lobby for the inclusion of China in the SAARC as full member.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Needless to say, a strong Pakistan and Sri Lanka together will mean much to the people and the countries of South Asia. The meaning is underneath.

5,http://telegraphnepal.com/the-kartarpur-corridor-imrans-biggest-six-ever/,"N.P. Upadhyaya: A naughty and venom spitting India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party cadre Vineet Agarwal recently accused Pakistan and China of “releasing poisonous gas ” that caused the heightened pollution in Delhi-NCR over the past week.
A BJP joker and the one who has, as the average Indians have, sick mindset of looking China and Pakistan as enemy.
Could be the upbringing problem after the British India Company left.
His funny opinion that Delhi’s high level smog may have been the handiworks of China and Pakistan has drawn severe criticisms from various quarters, however, for the sake of brevity we wish to bring in two separate remarks have emanated from two different locations targeting this fanatic BJP leader.
The first fiery remarks has come from Sweden and the commentator is a distinguished professor of Indian origin and the second is from China-India’s declared rival.
The Chinese commentator, Lijian Zhao is a Chinese diplomat having a recent stint in Pakistan
Let’s look into the first comment made by Swedish Professor Ashok Swain: He says, “These guys were even capable of blaming Pakistan and China for India’s population growth”.
Prof. Swain has spoken so many things unspoken and thus his comments need no elaboration from our side.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Lijian says, “What a joker! China sometimes takes the blame, but this time it took the God class blame. One may not draw such a conclusion, even if he or she thinks by the feet”.
Mr. Lijian Zhao, is serving the Information Department of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Indeed Bharat has lost its charms, if any it had in the past after the insulting and highly humiliating days of slavery ended with the “voluntary” departure of the British India Company, becomes visible as and when such sophisticated Indian brains make some buffoonery comments which in turn invite funny but meaningful comments from various quarters, for example, Dr. Claude Rakishit, an analysts of international standing, makes a comparison of the two neighboring Prime Ministers in South Asia.
He says, (sic), “The contrast between PM Imran Khan and PM Modi couldn’t be starker”.
Dr. Claude registers his comments on Tweeter, November 9/19 wherein he compared PM Khan with Modi and notes visible difference in the working styles of the two dignitaries.
If he finds PM Khan as a man working for peace then PM Modi, as this scholar means perhaps, is a man whose actions appear more to invite violence than making peace in the region.
In fact PM Modi is a trouble maker who has terrified the entire South Asian region since he assumed the undeserved post of the Prime Minister.
Dr. Rakishit in subtle manner has high praise for the Pakistani Prime Minister who by opening the Kartarpur Road has made the entire Sikh world happy.
PM Khan has definitely made a history in fact, the Nepalese believe. Modi is a limb to the entire South Asian region to put it mildly.
Fitting tentatively to the line of thinking of Dr. Claude Rakishit, yet another gentleman Tony Ashai says in his Tweeter account dated November 9/19 that “ I am so proud of my friend Imran Khan for opening Kartarpur corridor for the Sikh community. We need tolerance and respect for each other. While IK is welcoming Sikhs in Pakistan (then) India is alienating Muslims with Babri Mashjid verdict. In all this the agony of 8 million Kashmiri is lost”.
The same Tweeter man Tony further writes “It would have been unimaginable in 1947 if someone had told the SIKHS that your biggest Gurudwara will be built by Muslims. This is why we must keep hope alive because God works in mysterious ways. One day Kashmiris will live in peace with Indians and the Pakistanis”.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

After more than 70 years, Indian Sikhs were able to visit one of the religion’s holiest sites by crossing the international border with Pakistan without a visa.
Devout Sikhs attending the celebration in Kartarpur were seen becoming emotional and some even shed tears.
Their excitement was real and beyond elaboration.
The Pakistan government under Imran Khan made an exemplary gesture towards the Sikhs across the world, more so to the Indian Sikhs by making their travel easier to Gurudwara Darbar so that the Sikhs could bow their heads in front of the Guru whom they take as their most revered religious personality.
The Kartarpur Corridor is a 4.1 kilometer (2.5 mile) overland passage that links the Dera Baba Nana shrine in northwest India’s Gurdaspur with the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan, writes the CNN.
The Sikh temple-known as a Gurdwara-of Darbar Sahib is believed to be where the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, lived and died at the start of the 16th century.
Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, situated in Kartarpur, is considered to be the second holiest place for the Sikh community.
This is 120 km away from Lahore and situated in a small village of Kothey-pind at the bank of River Ravi-at a distance of only 4 km from Pakistan-India border.
Braving the high inner pains but yet the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Bhai Damodar das Modi on Saturday thanked his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan for respecting the sentiments of India.
This he may have said with a heavy heart.
The opening of Kartarpur Sahib Corridor before the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev has brought us immense happiness, the Indian Prime Minister Modi reiterated.
PM Modi is not that much comfortable with the opening of this corridor as he believes that this passage may be used by the Pakistan side to “export” terrorism in his country. However, the fact is that India is the biggest exporter of terrorism in the entire South Asian nations, for example, Nepal is a classic case for having been the center of target of the Indian establishment since the very first day of the unceremonious emergence of the Indian republic in 1947 in South Asia.
Since then the smaller countries housed in this landmass have been subjected to Indian terror.
India is very expert in inviting saleable political personalities from the neighboring countries and later trains and indoctrinates them and at an opportune moment, and uses those indoctrinated political men to create troubles in the countries from where the leaders have had been picked up some time back.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday inaugurated the much-awaited Kartarpur Corridor in Punjab province, paving the way for thousands of Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit the highly revered Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara.
PM Khan repeated his desire to make peace with Indi provided the latter reciprocated.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

To recall, India and Pakistan are not in good terms after the Indian annexation of Kashmir August 5.
The inauguration of the Kartarpur Road comes ahead of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism, on November 12.
Meanwhile, former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh led the first delegation of Sikh pilgrims as they crossed into Pakistan through the Kartarpur Corridor.
Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh was also part of the ‘jatha’ while Cricketer N. Sidhu was the chief guest at the opening ceremony in Pakistan.
“I hope India and Pakistan relations (will) improve enormously as a result of this beginning,” former India’s proxy Prime Minister Dr. Man Mohan Singh told PTV as he walked towards the Pakistan side, terming the occasion a “big moment”.
Dr. Singh is the one who damaged Nepal by encouraging Shyam Saran in the early 2006 who used the then Maoists residing in New Delhi, if one were to recall.
Amarinder Singh, the bete noir of Nav Jot Singh Siddhu told the Dawn news that they were all happy because it had been a desire of the Sikhs to visit their religious sites in Pakistan for 70 years.
Film actor turned BJP man Sunny Deol too visited Kartarpur Saheb. Nepal’s undeclared King “Indian Ambassador His Majesty M.S. Puri was also spotted in the Kartarpur ceremony.
About 8,000-10,000 pilgrims were expected to arrive from around the world to mark Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary.
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan and Siddhu, a former Indian cricketer, appeared excited in meeting each other at the inauguration venue.
Khan-Siddhu intimate bond is Pakistan-India relations for the moment.
The PM of Pakistan was heard anxiously asking some high officials as to HAMARA SIDDHU KAHAN HAI (Where is our Siddhu)?
This explains the level of Khan-Siddhu undefined friendly ties.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

In his speech during the inauguration ceremony, NS Sidhu said, “It is the first time since partition that the boundaries have been dismantled. No one can deny my friend Imran Khan’s contribution. I thank Modi ji also for it. I am sending a Munnabhai MBBS-style hug to you Modi saheb for this.”
Recalling his hug last year with Pakistan Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, which had drawn criticism from Amarinder, Sidhu said, “I will thump my chest and say my jhappi (hug) bore fruit and got the doors of Guru’s place opened. Brother, now open the borders. Why should we spread hatred and get sons of mothers killed while guarding the borders?”
Siddhu had become emotional while saying this.
Visibly, PM Khan’s love and honor for Siddhu was evident as they later sat together.
Speaking at the inaugural function the Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi called Sidhu the “man of the match” of Kartarpur corridor and said he is the real hero for getting it opened.
Responding to a question that he was being given credit for the opening of the corridor, Sidhu said, “It has all been done by Baba Nanak.”
Interestingly, at the gurdwara, youths vied with each other to take selfies with Sidhu.
Most Congress and AAP MLAs were also seen greeting him.
But if the entire Indian establishment takes Siddhu as a close man of Pakistan (more so of PM Khan), however, for Pakistan Siddhu is a stable and friendly link in between the troubled relations of India and Pakistan.
Siddhu’s personal affection and love for Imran Khan is simply exemplary.
To put it bluntly, looking at Siddhu-Khan relationship in these months, what could well be said that NS Siddhu is Pakistan’s Goodwill Ambassador to India.
This is Pakistani gain for free. Khan’s equal reciprocity must have come into play, let’s presume.
In a true sense and that too without hurting the sentiments of the common Indian nationals, what could be now said bluntly that it was this Indian Cricketer who has of late acted like a bridge in between the two rival nations-India and Pakistan.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

An ordinary Indian national is the bridge in between the two warring rivals? Unbelievable but yet this is the fact.
Thanks General Qamar Javed Bazwa that he sounded to Siddhu last year that Pakistan has been thinking for the opening of the Kartarpur Saheb Road which shall allow the Indian Sikhs to pay their homage to Guru Nanak Sahab.
Later NS Siddhu made strenuous efforts inside his country in making the idea primarily floated by General Bazwa a grand success and it has taken a formal shape now.
And that it has already been a “triumph story” in that the Kartarpur Saheb corridor is open for the entire Sikhs despite the clandestine Himalayan efforts made by the BJP regime under the tight control of the Hindu terror machine PM Modi to avert this happening.
PM Modi have had to give his positive nod simply because there had been intense pressure from within and without for the opening of this corridor.
Modi and his entire destructive troika team (Modi-Dival-Shankar) must have shed tears in private.
Sikh politics appears to have slipped from the hands of terror machine-PM Modi but instead Siddhu is the point man for the entire Sikhs.
With the opening of this small passage for the Gurudwara in Naruwal, Pakistan, some mentally retarded brains in India have begun suspecting the very credentials of the Pakistan Prime Minister Khan for having exhibited his promptness in opening of this Sikh corridor inside his country.
The fear is of the emergence of Khalistan State which is not the business of PM Khan to meddle as the Khalistani people are there to look for their matters internal to them.
These stinking biased scholars fear that this Corridor may encourage the KHALISTAN supporters to step up their activities for a separate Khalistan State by 2020 with the meaningful support of the Pakistani government.
This is baseless in that if the Sikhs across the world so desire they can accomplish this task on their own. They have the capabilities with dedication to do so and they will do so without asking for foreign support.
It is the declared avowal of the Sikhs residing in Canada, the United Kingdom, America and Australia that by 2020 they will leave no stone unturned for the formation of their desired separate state of the Sikhs: the KHALISTAN.
Yes indeed with the opening of the Kartarpur passage, the Sikhs have recharged themselves. That was evident.
Look what this perverted scholar says of the Kartarpur corridor under a Hindustan Times headline “The corridor is a trap that Pakistan has set for India” penned by Sushant Sareen dated November 11/19.
The writer Sareen says, “The Pakistanis have found Sidhu useful. They have identified him as a person who can further their agenda, even if inadvertently and unwittingly. The way Bajwa made him the messenger of the corridor decision, the way the Pakistanis are projecting him as the man who made the corridor possible, the importance they are giving him by treating him as the real representative of Sikh sentiment and a friend of Pakistan — all suggest that the Pakistanis see in Sidhu their trump card to muddy the waters in the Indian border state. Sidhu should guard against this. It is possible that Sidhu sees this is an opportunity to come into his own”.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The perverted brain claims that “it will not lead to a diplomatic détente (between India and Pakistan). Instead, it gives Islamabad more leverage to use the Khalistani card”
How NS Siddhu and Pakistan establishment react to this accusation shall have to be watched.
Yet Nepali observers say that this road could be a diplomatic détente if India understand the good intentions of its neighbor. Kartarpur passage is definitely a diplomatic détente.
PM Khan now bags the moral support of the entire Sikh community for his affection shown towards the Sikh community.
To sum up: The so called Hindu Nationalists in India may differ but the opening of Kartarpur corridor has united the Punjabi community immaterial of their religious beliefs across the border.
The Muslims and the 14 crore Sikhs have embraced each other. This is simply incredible. Hats off to both.
This is indeed Imran’s biggest “sixer” made ever within and outside of the cricketing pitch. South Asia has now a leader who could be trusted unconditionally.
Obviously Modi’s loss is Khan’s gain in global politics. Simple math.",/analysis,"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 21:20:47 +0000"
6,http://telegraphnepal.com/nepal-the-secret-royal-meeting/,"N.P. Upadhyaya, Kathmandu: Not so many intelligent brains in Nepal intend to believe that on the midnight (better call it late evening around 10. 15 PM) of October 12/19, a high level Chinese official who was accompanying President Xi Jinping’s visit to Nepal secretly entered into the compound of the former King Gyanendra and talked with the now deposed King for almost forty five minutes and then made his way back to the Soaltee Hotel.
He then reported the gist of his conversation with the former “His majesty the King of Nepal” to President Xi, high placed sources claim.
The people are reluctant in digesting this secret meet but the fact is that the meet took place for sure.
Yet the ruling elites who knew the happening of this spine chilling event have begun making erratic utterances.
The presumed Delhi man Prachanda is the hard hit among the crowd.
That evening Soaltee Hotel was the center of political attraction with the visit of the Chinese President Xi Jinping who had landed in Kathmandu straight from Chennai upon the completion of his India visit.
What transpired in between President Xi’s special emissary and the King Gyanendra has not been made public (nor would it come to light ever), however, our own source claims that the “secret talks” went all well and the Chinese emissary apparently regretted over the Chinese lapses in having ignored the King at a time when the King needed the Chinese support most.
China had indeed betrayed the Nepal King then.
In fact, King Gyanendra had become the target of the entire Indian establishment when he (the then King Gyanendra) made some visible efforts in bringing China into the scheme of the regional body-the SAARC as an observer.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The King’s sincere efforts made then for the prestigious inclusion of China in the SAARC regional body as an Observer is what pained and annoyed the Indian Union under proxy and the cursed PM Dr. MM Singh who concluded instantly that King Gyanendra must be ousted or else the Chinese will replace India in Nepal. Elephantine size but with small heart that India is.
But yet China joined SAARC as an Observer finally. India in turn inserted Afghanistan in the SAARC body.
And as per this scheme, the RAW agents, both within and without, together with the then agitating seven parties led by the most destructive political personality late G. P. Koirala made it a one point agenda and that being the ouster of King Gyanendra once and for all. It was Delhi’s project.
The RAW men in Nepali media also contributed much for the ouster of the then King. This is understandable as a posted servant has to abide by his masters’ command.
Not a surprise at all. Some media men though have changed the camps and joined Restore Monarchy campaign. But our own source claims that they were playing double.
The King’s summary ejection from the Nepali Crown was facilitated by naughty Father Shyam Saran who had been the designer of the People’s War and had also provided Prachanda and Babu Ram Bhattarai’s shelter in NOIDA, Delhi and had kept these Nepali Maoists leaders under the special care of the Indian government, so believed analyst Bharat Dahal. (Mr. Dahal could be approached for verification in Kathmandu).
The Chinese special emissary who met the King at Nirmal Nivas on October 12/19 also assured the King that China reposes full trust in the King’s diplomatic neutrality-capabilities and hoped that if an when the King bounces back to power shall keep Nepal committed to its long adhered “One China Policy” intact and the King in turn nodded his head as he does as and when he meets high profile personalities.
Professional colleague Professor Parsuram Kharel in his comprehensive fresh article on “course correction” has opined that King Gyanendra over these years “may” have visited China at least three times to sound the Chinese top officials that the restoration of the Nepali monarchy was in the interest of China in safeguarding China’s core security interests in Nepal.
However, observers here do not buy this theory that the China may have invited King Gyanendra straight to Beijing for constructive consultations.
China believes in quiet diplomacy and thus the visit to Beijing appear closer to a self-manufactured theory (with due respect to our senior colleague Prof. Kharel) for whatever reasons it may have been constructed. At best the Chinese officials may have met the King Gyanendra while the latter left Kathmandu for either Thailand or for that matter Singapore.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The meeting may have taken place in Bangkok or in Singapore.
Unconfirmed reports have it that the Indian national security advisor Ajit Doval may have met King Gyanendra either in Thailand or in Singapore.
Doval was sent by Indian PM Modi.
That India too is interested in the restoration of the Nepali monarchy came to the force when the Indian Ambassador to Nepal, the Junior His Majesty Shri Manjeev Singh Puri met the King in Sita Hotel in janakpur.
By the way, the Indian Ambassador Puri has been micro-managing Nepal through his paid agents.
Very recently when the King had visited Thailand/Singapore, he is told to have returned Kathmandu via New Delhi wherein he may have met with some leaders close to PM Modi including Amit Sah.
Most interesting of it all is a strong rumor which has it that on October 12/19 afternoon, when President Xi Jinping and PM Modi said good bye to each other in Chennai, PM Modi made a modest appeal to the Chinese Supreme leader that while being in Kathmandu he should meet the ousted monarch.
High placed sources opine that President Xi’s special envoy met the King in the late night of 12 October as per the suggestions of Indian Prime Minister Modi.
Some online portals in Nepal have said that President Xi wanted to meet the king but the ruling leaders did not allow him to do so for a variety of political reasons.
Some sources even claim that the Chinese emissary was Chinese foreign Minister Wang Yi). But it has not so far been substantiated by our own source.
If this is correct or at least close to accurate then reasons are abundant to assume that as regards the agenda for the restoration of the Nepali Monarchy, both India and China at the highest level prefer that King’s presence in Nepal shall at least deter both China and India from colliding in Nepal. Both converge on the point that Nepal must now have the King restored.
The fact is that both India and China have now come to their senses that the Nepali monarchy had at least kept the two giant neighbors at a comfortable distance which was convincing to both.
Though Indian influence were at the height in Nepal even at time of the prevalence of Monarchy but yet China too wasn’t that unhappy with Nepal because the Monarchy had made substantial efforts in not allowing anti-China activities from the Nepali soil.
Moreover, Nepali Monarchy have had intimate ties in the past with the heroes and builders of modern China like Mao Tse Tung or Deng Xiao Ping.
To a greater extent China during those days had compromised with the reality that with the borders open in between Nepal and India, Nepal have had to adjust its relations with India in many more ways than one even if such a relation pained at times.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Chairman Mao always suggested Nepal to have closer ties with India.
Now with the passage of time, both India and China have apparently come to a conclusion that Monarchy be restored which shall do justice with both of the neighbors.
China needs Nepali guarantee that its soil must not be used against anti-China activities.
China doesn’t trust the India trained communist leaders.
King Gyanendra was the first political persona in South Asia to float the theory of Nepal, if endorsed, becoming a bridge in between China and India.
Later several other leaders made necessary elaborations suiting to their political leanings.
Perhaps it is in these background President Xi’s emissary may have visited King’s private residence in Maharajgunj and conveyed Xi’s ear pleasing message to the Nepali monarch who lost his throne while doing a “necessary favor” to China during the Dhaka SAARC Summit but the Chinese regime instead of coming to the rescue of the sinking King preferred to leave him in the deep blue ocean without life jacket.
A section of the interested media men and intellectuals though maintained that President Xi himself dropped at the King’s residence on October 12 which is hundred percent incorrect and absurd.
Yes he wanted to meet Gyanendra as revealed by some online portals.
Having said all these, the national politics after President Xi’s departure from Nepal, October 13, 2019, Father Shyam Saran and his “adopted sons” both in politics and media in Nepal have suddenly become active which bodes ill for the Nepali nation.
Needless to say, as and when Father Shyam Saran becomes active, Nepal is pushed to the wall as witnessed in the year 2005-6 which tentatively made Nepal as the second protectorate in South Asia after Baby Bhutan.
Very freshly expansionist India has gulped Nepali landmass in Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulek and inserted in its official map. The occasional nationalists have taken Indian act as an insult to Nepal. Yes yes Thank you foreign minister has no courage to talk to his counterpart in India, it is believed.
Though it may pain some strong Nepali nationalists, however, the fact is that Father Shyam Saran was able to catapult Nepal’s politics then only when some of the corrupt and perverted sons of the soil who were largely paid by the Indian RAW agency backed Saran’s devastating steps takes against Nepal.
RAW rules Nepal, it is talked in Nepal’s political circuit.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

It is these Nepali rotten eggs who were up again in inviting father Shyam Saran in Nepali politics to deter the “manufactured threat” of increasing Chinese influence in Nepal.
An inferiority complex ridden retired Indian Military man Ashok Mehta has written an article wherein he almost suggests Indian establishment to check the Nepali steps which were inching towards China before it would be too late to bring back Nepal into Indian sphere of influence.
China understands the Indian tricks but its “diplomatic mission” in Kathmandu takes the pro Indian lobby as their own men.
It is this Saran lobby in Kathmandu which has been floating several baseless and distorted theories to malign Nepal-China ties.
But the fact is that both India and China must come to terms as far as their independent relations with “ancient” Nepal are concerned because Nepal is to stay here for long time to come.
Nepal though at the moment is politically weak after the “great political change gifted by “Father Shyam saran”, but yet the country is not that weak to melt down under the threat either of India or China.
Nepal needs, by the same token, both India and China for the preservation of its continued sovereignty. The three countries must come to terms as the geopolitics demands. No other option with these countries. Nepal too has no other way than to live in harmony.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Fortunately, if China has assured Nepal that it shall come to safeguard Nepali sovereignty under any circumstances then India unfortunately, has never uttered a single word that it will come forward in preserving Nepali sovereignty.
So this is the marked difference as to why Nepali people love to hate India and its shaky Prime Minister Modi who is taken by the general population in Nepal as a close enemy of the entire nation.
However, PM Modi wants the restoration of the Nepali Monarchy to keep Nepal under his Hindutva palms, however, the question is also that an India elevated and restored King in Nepal can keep Nepal independent and will he then be able to keep the two neighbors-India and China at an equal distance? Can he do justice with China? Will he be able to look into the interests, if any, that of the lone super power USA and its brain child the Indo-Pacific Strategy?
Needless to say, Nepal’s deposed King represents the entire Hindu world. He is taken as Hindu Emperor.
Most importantly if and when HE bounces back to power, can he keep the friendly countries at a desirable distance that is satisfying to all these countries mentioned? That’s all.",/analysis,"Thu, 07 Nov 2019 03:06:52 +0000"
7,http://telegraphnepal.com/kashmir-situation-unsustainable-and-bad/,"Kathmandu: Indian Journalist Sunaina Mullick writes October 30/19 that a study conducted by IIT-H (Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad) reveals that the Indians have a smaller Brain compared to the rest of the world.
Fitting revelation that it is-better late than never.
This million dollar “exposé” has come at a time when the Indian nation should have known this about themselves much earlier. Yet it is not too late.
Thus this news assumes greater significance in the current context when each day beginning August 5, India is getting ‘uncovered’ among the comity of nations for its Himalayan blunder in having teased and challenged the Kashmiri population-patience and longing-a population that had been awaiting the conduct of the promised UN plebiscite for the determination of their fate since seven decades or so.
Pundit Nehru had Okayed the UN mediation and Mahatma Gandhi too had said that “if the population prefer India or even Pakistan they should then be allowed to select the country of their choice”.
However, later the Indian republic born 1947 backed out from its earlier commitments.
Even Pundit Nehru and his descendants (Mrs. Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi) too toed the same line which meant that the Kashmiris were told to wait ad infinitum to get their dreams come true.
Notably, UN has made several resolutions in the past on Kashmir.
These resolutions apart, there is the prevalence of the Shimla accord which too has been ignored by the Indian establishment while scrapping the special status of the Indian administered Kashmir.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Julfikar Ali Bhutto and Smt. Indira Gandhi has signed the aforementioned accord in Shimla.
This scrapping of the Article 370 in effect has detached the Indian Union with India controlled Kashmir.
Article 370 was more or less a link in between the people of Kashmir with the Indian Union.
The important connect stands broken.
The Kashmiri lockdown more or less continues since August 5 even as of today.
The most hard hit are the Kashmiri children who have since August 5, not attended their schools. The entire Kashmir valley has a deserted look since August 5/19.
The Indian army rules supreme.
As regards the high handedness of the Indian Army in Kashmir valley Ms. Jackson Lee (US) says “I believe this is a moment in time of history the USA must intervene to stop a potential genocide in Kashmir. This is the right time”.
Indian analyst Sadanand Dhumey writes quoting Akar Patel, October 27/19 that “This months (October 2019) congressional hearings in Washington “expose a fundamental hypocrisy about this new India of ours. We want to screw over our minorities but also want to retain our image as a tolerant and peaceful”.
Her comments came close on the heels when reports appeared in a section of the international press that “the traumatizing incident of Kunan Poshpora where close to 100 women were raped in one (single) night by the patrolling Indian forces.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The US apparently has remained tight lipped and prefers not to press the Indian establishment to ease the imposed restrictions on Kashmir.
Tension remains in the valley.
The rest of the population have since then (August 5, 2019) been denied of their fundamental rights to the extent that the former Chief Ministers of Kashmir too have been house arrested.
This explains the functioning of the largest democracy?
Isn’t it a mobocracy?
The fieriest attack came to India by none less than from the President Erdogen of Turkey who while addressing the UN general assembly in September lambasted at India and said that the regime had committed atrocities on the Kashmiri Muslim population which need to be eased at the earliest. The Turkish President wanted the restrictions to be eased.
To add insult to injury, President Erdogen sharp criticism made on Indian barbarism as regards the Kashmiri lockdown was very powerfully endorsed by the most senior leader in the contemporary world- the Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohammad who took even the risk of the expected Indian wrath. But he censured India on Kashmir lockdown.
India as a retaliatory measure, has banned the Palm Oli import from Malaysia. Thanks no economic blockade on Malaysia.
The Malaysian Prime Minister remains undeterred as of now.
The news that the Indians possess smaller brains (as compared to its elephantine size?) must have consoled all those political personalities and the countries who primarily differ sharply with the Indian action on Kashmir.
The Nepali people are against the Indian action on Kashmir, however, the protectorate sort of Nepal Government apparently takes the Kashmir issue as an issue internal to the Indian Union to which it is definitely not.
Kashmir is a disputed territory.
To recall, the Pakistan’s Military man Pervez Musarraf while talking to one Indian TV Channel (Most likely the Military general was talking to news anchor Rahul Kanwal) had bluntly said that “Indians have small heart as compared to its elephantine size”.
And now the Indian scientist has tentatively proved that the Indians really possess smaller brains.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

That the Indians have smaller brains have been divulged by Professor/Scientist Mrs. Jayanthi Sivaswamy who made these somewhat India disturbing statement while granting an exclusive interview to the Times of India recently.
Notably, Professor Jayanthi Sivaswamy is from the Centre of Visual Information Technology,
She further says that even the Chinese and Korean templates were created as well but nothing matched the India-specific population.
She goes on to say “That’s why a team was specially assembled to create India’s first ever brain-atlas, specific to Indian origins and genes. The team consisted of 50 individuals and was gender neutral”.
So this perhaps put to rest the general self-pleasing impression among the Indian nationals that they were the most capable and knowledgeable person in the world which has summarily been dismissed by an Indian scientist Professor Jayanthi.
Now it is the turn of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to speak something on Kashmir lockdown.
And here she blasts at the Indian establishment while being in Delhi itself as a guest.
German Chancellor Angela was in India on an official visit wherein the chancellor ( she is a physics professor from the Eastern part of Germany) raised the Kashmir difficulty throughout her talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Friday night, and conveyed that the “situation for the people in Kashmir is unsustainable and not good”, in keeping with German journalists accompanying her, writes Darius Booding, November 2, 2019 who is also accompanying the Chancellor in Delhi.
Michaela Kuefner, the Chief Political Editor at DW, Germany’s worldwide TV channel, tweeted that in a “modest pre-dinner criticism of the Kashmir clampdown, Merkel said that “the State of affairs for the individuals there may be unsustainable and never good”.

""Not sustainable and not good"": German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized New Delhi's clampdown in Kashmir during her visit to India. pic.twitter.com/NeaYtWWuTG
— DW News (@dwnews) November 1, 2019

Merkel met Modi for a second spherical of talks at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, official residence, adds Darius Booding for the LIIST Studio.
Quite interesting is the fact that ahead of the visit of the German Chancellor a group of largely right-wing European parliamentarians (MEPs) had visited Indian-administered Kashmir, prompting outrage from local politicians who have not been allowed to go.
The visit has been criticized as nothing more than a PR stunt of the Himalayan dimension.
Some even in India itself have dubbed the visit of the Europeean Parliamentarians as a “Guided Tour-Kashmir”.
This was the first international delegation to visit the region since August, when India’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stripped the state of its autonomy, splitting it into two federally run territories and locking it down for weeks.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Rumors claim that National Security Adviser Mr. Ajit Doval had arranged this guided tour of the right-wing European parliamentarians (MEPs).
The EU delegation initially comprised 27 members from countries including the UK, Spain, Germany, France, Italy and Poland – although four decided not to visit what has been India’s only Muslim majority state and returned to their home countries.
In the meanwhile, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has stressed that it is for India and Pakistan to find a lasting solution to the Kashmir issue in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people.
Reiterating the UK government’s stand on Kashmir, Johnson described both India and Pakistan as “important partners to the UK” in a letter dated as back as September 6 in response to a letter written last month by Conservative Party MP Bob Blackman.
On October 30, as reported by the Times of India the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson (Wednesday) said in the British Parliament that the UK’s long standing stance of Kashmir being a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan remains unchanged although the situation in the valley is of “profound” concern to the country.
For the Road: One European Union MP was allegedly uninvited from visiting Kashmir after he expressed the desire to “travel freely, unaccompanied”.
Chris Davies, Member of the European Parliament for North West England, was a part of the group of EU MPs who were invited to visit Kashmir to see the situation on the ground.
Chris Davies is the hero for having boycotted the Guided Trip to Kashmir. That’s all.",/analysis,"Sun, 03 Nov 2019 02:19:45 +0000"
8,http://telegraphnepal.com/nepalisnothongkong/,"N.P. Upadhyaya, Kathmandu: China, frankly speaking has made greater inroads in Nepal over these years.
The non-ending Indian coercive policy towards Nepal compelled the later to inch closer to the Northern mighty neighbor-China.
Senior journalist-analyst C. Raja Mohan tentatively has accepted this fact in a fresh article on Nepal-India ties.
Since China has come, it will remain for long time to come.
China’s stay here in Nepal is a must in order to balance “tilted” neighborly ties.
China’s longer stay in Nepal may have caused immense pain to some domestic tilted literati, however, the fact is that China entered Nepal more or less on Nepali populations’ fervent appeal and requests.
The Indian inhumane blockade of the year 2015 came as an opportune moment for Northern neighbor China to make its penetration in Nepal and the then Nepal Prime Minister KP Oli himself flew to Beijing to facilitate China’s entrance in Nepal.
Since then China has gradually increased its political as well as economic strength in Nepal.
But then this should not mean that PM Oli has affection for China up to the brim. Not at all. President Xi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi must not have any illusions.
(The Nepali people understand their leaders better and they also know as to which force on earth makes our leaders to swing the 12 point way).
For PM Oli the Medanta Hospital obligations still remains.
It is this Hospital in Delhi which remained instrumental in the treatment of his ailing Kidneys.
(Strong rumors claim that PM Oli had fresh dialysis at the Grande Hospital in Kathmandu. The entire affair has been kept a secret).
Similarly, for Prachanda the Delhi hospitality is very near and dear to him or else his India sponsored War would not have come to an end as desired by father Saran and Prachanda.
But yet with China’s arrival in Nepal, people now love to hate India for a variety of political reasons.
Most importantly, two factors distinguish India from China at least in Nepal.
First, if India talks too much and makes tall promises, then China talks less and acts as per its promise.

Once incident pertaining to Nepal-India relations would not be irrelevant in recalling for the larger interest of the readers both within and without.
A single instance. India gifted one Military helicopter to Nepal when Sushil Koirala was Prime Minister.
The flying machine, as was disseminated in the Godi media both in India and Nepal, was the token of love and honor to Nepal government from the government of India.
Hardly some months of the gift ceremony had gone by, Nepal government received a hefty bill to be paid by the Nepal government for the purchase of the Helicopter which, let’s recall, had been gifted by the friend across the border.
Observers presume that Nepal must have paid the bulky bill from the Indian government.
This is just a single instance.
Despite the existence of such a bitter reality in Nepal-India ties, yet our relations are “excellent” and “irreplaceable” in the eyes of some myopic intellectuals who for reasons unknown to the observers, the universe begins and end with India.
Beyond India, the civilization doesn’t exist, this is what they presume. They are at fault.
So it is taken as tilt syndrome.
(By the way, India is struggling with the Manipur secession problem. Manipur officials have made a declaration in London that they were a separate Country).
It is this flock of highly qualified academicians (they are not perhaps) which even ignores the Blockade of the year 2015.
All these said and done, China understands that the final say in Nepal will that be of India’s because of the continued Indian domination which has been there since the very first days of the emergence of the Indian republic, 1947.
The domination in return is reciprocated by subservience.
Some intelligent brains in Nepal remain askance as to why the British India Company left for good the present day Indian republic?
President Xi visited Nepal October 12-13 and left Kathmandu with a fervent hope that Nepali authorities shall control the anti-China activities from the Nepali soil.
He was hoping against hope perhaps.
Bikash Thakur, an energetic youth from Nepal’s Terai bluntly asserts that present day rulers of communist Nepal in fact have been playing hide and seek game with China.
If the Nepali officials assure the Chinese authorities that Nepal remains committed to “one China policy”, however, in reality it is these Nepali rulers who have intimate ties with the representative of the Dalai Lama in Kathmandu.
Beijing knows this fact but pretends not to have sensed.
According to Mr. Thakur, not only the former Indian based/nourished Maoists leader Prachanda and the incumbent Prime Minister KP Oli but even the sitting President of the Republic Mrs. Bidya Devi Bhandari have tacit linkages with the Dalai representative in Kathmandu.
Thakur claims that these high flying Nepali leaders have been maintaining close contacts with the Dalai man in Kathmandu since 2013.
By the way, several Nepali Congress leaders also possess intimate links” with the man whom Beijing dislikes in Nepal.
To recall, during the Royal regime, the office of the Dalai Lama was told to pack up from Nepal.
However, Nepal has never failed in assuring China that she is committed to curb the anti-China elements and would not allow them to create troubles in bordering Tibet-China’s underbelly.
Interestingly, Mr. Thakur’s grand revelation has come close on the heels of President Xi’s Nepal visit.
President Xi has made several agreements with Nepal which would be helpful in lessening Nepal’s high dependency on India.
Above all, the million dollar announcement made by China’s President Xi Jinping while being in Nepal is his blunt but ear pleasing assurance that Nepal no longer remains a landlocked country and that Nepal henceforth is a “land linked country”.
It is this statement that has unnerved the Indian establishment.
But yet, the final say shall be that of India as per the wishes of those domestic men for whom India is the beginning and the end as well.
A word to China: Prior to signing the agreements with Nepal hence forth, China would do well to insert a clause that restricts the other signatory i.e. Nepal government from selling the China gifted factories or for that matter any similar infrastructure(s).
Or else, chances shall remain for happening of the repetition of the previous acts that sold all the China gifted projects that included several factories.
Notably, the Nepali Congress government under (late) Girija Prasad Koirala made it a point after the so called change to see the entire China assisted projects as a dirt cheap price.
Finance Minister Mahesh Acharya (?) and his successors perhaps did everything to erase Chinese signature projects from the Nepali soil, it is highly rumored.
A Chinese Ambassador posted in Nepal had ventilated his pains, 2009 that the Nepal government had sold only those projects which had been gifted by China to the people of Nepal.
The Chinese envoy made this disclosure for the first time in Kathmandu at a program convened by Kishore Shrestha-the Chair of the Nepal-China media society that time in 2009-10.
Mr. Thakur made these observations while talking to a Nepali journalist Rishi Dhamala recently.
As the rumor had it, Mr. Thakur was arrested by Nepal government on charges that he was engaged in anti-China activities to which Mr. Thakur summarily denies.
“I only wrote in my Facebook status that Chinese hackers should be penalized who had hacked some Nepali Banks-ATM and that Nepali girls are being forced in the flesh trade in China these days.
“The police arrested me for having hinted the visiting Chinese President to look into these matters seriously, however, Nepal police arrested me concluding that I was acting against China which is not true”, claims Thakur. To sum up, China has reasons to suspect the political credentials of the ruling leaders, however, what is also advisable to the Chinese officials not to take a rigid stance on those whom Beijing alleges that they were engaged in anti-China activities from the Nepali soil.
Hardened stance of China will only benefit India for multiple reasons.
Compared to Hong Kong protests, anti-China acts in Nepal could be taken as insignificant. That’s all.",/analysis,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 01:26:35 +0000"
9,http://telegraphnepal.com/xis-nepal-visit-alarms-us/,"N. P. Upadhyaya, Kathmandu: Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Nepal has drawn the world’s attention in that Xi left China upon meeting the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and then landed in India and met with his permanent rival PM Modi and finally the China’s top man made his first ever trip to Nepal on October 12.
Chinese footsteps in Nepal have come in a quiet but formal manner which subtly hints that India has been distanced.
The US too appears to have concerned with the “increasing Chinese influence in Nepal”.
The US has reasons to express concern as it wants Nepal to ease the restrictions that Nepal government has imposed on the Tibetan-Buddhists residing in Nepal.
While Nepal may have its own “neighborly” compulsions in containing the likely threats to China from the Nepali soil, however, China too must think that the Tibetans living in Nepal must have some freedom of expression and that they too should be allowed to do what they consider as a part of their “religious” duty.
China’s rigidity is more than necessary, a section feels so.
China, being a powerful country, must not get terrified by these small acts in Nepal, in comparison of how things prevail in Hong Kong.
Moreover, China would do well if it reads the susceptibility of Nepal. For Nepal, the friendship with the devilish neighbor-India and the lone super power US are also very important and that any excessive pressure from China will perhaps prompt the US and the Indian establishment to further increase anti-China activities from the Nepali soil.
China should know that at the moment the Indian regime and the US administration were having the same wavelength in politics. Thanks the US designed Indo-Pacific Strategy in which the US wants Nepal to play a central role?
But Nepal has to satisfy all: the US, India and China as well.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

A US top diplomat in Washington has claimed that China’s increased influence in Nepal has led to the ban on Dalai Lama’s birthday celebrations in the Himalayan nation. The US apparently is referring this increment after President Xi’s visit to Nepal.
Ms. Alice G Wells, Acting Assistant Secretary of State of USA, Bureau of South and Central Asia in a briefing to the House of Foreign Affairs sub Committee on Asia and Pacific had made this statement, October 23, 2019.
While this reveals the US’s interest distinctly clear in Nepal then why China prefers greater restrictions on the Tibetan Buddhist community in Nepal too is concurrently logical?
Whatever may be the case, the friendly nations must understand the Nepali government’s compulsions.
But the associated fact too need to be told to these competing countries, the US, China and India, that the sitting corrupt and dangerous communist government a la North Korean regime can’t do justice in satisfying these three mega-Nations in assuring them at a time that Nepal will treat these friends in an equal manner.
Nepal not even remains a non-aligned country though PM Oli is attending the NAM Summit in Baku, Azerbaijan.
In Baku PM Oli spoke of the significance of the NAM but is Indo-pendent Nepal a nonaligned nation? Nepal previously was but is not now.
In fact Nepal lacks a strong and neutral/dynamic political personality who could understand as to how to address the ensuing problems so that all the three together with the developed Western nations countries’ feel that their concerns have been well taken care of without prejudice.
Reiteration of friendship with all but enmity with none can’t hide the Indian tilt.
The US President Trump must understand that India is an all-time cheat and also a highly intimidating regional bully which wants to keep the smaller South Asian nations in its grip called the Nehruvian doctrine. Nehru though is being demonized these days by the BJP regime controlled by PM Modi.
System(s) of governance in Nepal depend on the mercy of the Indian Republic. And the change of 2005-6 ushered in through the kind courtesy of Madame Sonia’s proxy Prime Minister Dr. MM Singh and his bulging-goiter Father Shyam Saran.
Since then Nepal is in a disarray and the continued blockade ( as of now four blockades have been recorded) from the Indian side has in effect made Nepal to inch closer to the Chinese regime or else most of the Nepali leaders tentatively were the yes men of the Indian regime.
Nepal’s compulsion. Does the US know? The US must acknowledge this fact.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Notably, India’s Nepal policy after 12 point India designed change has been of a brutal in nature and it is this brutality and devilish attitude towards Nepal that the latter have had to inch closer to China.
Though China too is not that a good and reliable neighbor by Nepali standards but yet this is also Nepal’s necessary-compulsion.
Yet to lessen the Indian meanness associated with higher dependence, Nepal was bound to warm up its age-old ties with China in the North.
An important point for the US: If the superficial smile like Wuhan spirit is taken out from the existing India-China relations then surely that equals to a real and a full scale war of the sort of 1962 which broke the vertebral column of India.
India since then (1962) remains scared of the Chinese military might. Who else knows China better than the humiliatingly defeated India?
A country less complaisant towards China might well have called off the summit three days before it happened, when Beijing, after Xi’s meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, publicly declared that China supported Pakistan’s core concerns, so writes Ajaya Shukla for the rediff.com dated October 22, 2019.
So which factor did not permit PM Modi and his foreign policy advisors, like Doval and Shankar, to abruptly cancel President Xi’s trip to India?
Compulsion or a fear factor? Needless to say, India is a paper tiger for the smaller South Asian nations more so for Nepal and Bhutan.
A scared India beamingly greeted Chinese President perhaps to keep alive the shaky Wuhan spirit.
This amounts to backing Islamabad’s claim, writes Mr. Shukla, over all of Jammu and Kashmir and, in effect, the abandonment of Beijing’s professed neutrality on the Kashmir dispute.
But does it mean that Beijing has abandoned its neutrality on issues pertaining to Jammu and Kashmir? Certainly not. Beijing did justice by supporting Pakistan’s core concerns on Kashmir issue.
China is Pakistan’s “iron brother” and both are happy with this terminology. However, this special relation that binds both Pakistan and China in one component is their respective love and honor for each other and a commitment for working together for shared benefits for example the China Pakistan Economic Corridor-CPEC whose miracles are soon to come to notice to the world public.
Pakistan is likely to emerge as an economic tiger when the CPEC mega projects approaches its final stage.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Pakistan-China ties are not like Nepal-India ties which is not only unequal but insulting as well in that the Indian leadership take Nepal as a protectorate a la Baby Bhutan.
Naughty Indian leaders forget deliberately that Nepal is an ancient nation whereas India was just born in 1947.
Nepal existed even in the Mahabharat era.
The Communist President Xi Jinping promised anybody who tried to “split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones.”
His comments were made towards Nepalese Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli.
He in essence warned India through PM Oli that not to play the Dalai Lama-Dharamshala card.
President Xi’s threat loaded statement made in Nepal must have approached the Indian leadership the next second in Delhi through the kind courtesy of the RAW posted agents in Nepal. But why he made this statement in Nepal that has alarmed the world is a tricky question indeed?
That New Delhi has become sensitive after Xi’s Nepal visit becomes clear from what C. Raja Mohan, an internationally acknowledged Indian scholar says in his hurriedly penned article wherein he says, “President Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Kathmandu has helped focus on the changing dynamic between India, China and Nepal.
He further says that “one of the central themes in the new discourse is the alleged loss of Indian “hegemony” over Nepal”.
C. Raja Mohan uses the word alleged loss which is incorrect. The fact is that Indian hegemony definitely has substantially decreased in Nepal and is sure to decrease even further.
The Indian scholar then suggests Modi’s administration to go by what he suggests and his suggestions run like this: “For India, it is time stop whining about China’s growing presence in Nepal or lamenting the loss of much-vaunted primacy in Nepal. The protectorate relationship that Delhi inherited from the Raj was never sustainable. Nothing infuriates the Kathmandu elite more than Delhi’s claim to know what is good for Nepal. Delhi does not. Instead, Delhi should let Nepalese decide what is good for them and tailor India’s own responses accordingly”.
Let Nepal decide what is appropriate for this country but not Delhi as suggested by C Mohan.

Let’s now talk of Kashmir where Indian establishment has been treating the caged Kashmiris as prisoners since August 5/19.
This Tuesday October 22/19 the US renewed its call on India to ease its clampdown in Kashmir as several lawmakers voiced anger at actions by a country that usually enjoys robust US support.
Alice Wells, the assistant secretary of state for South Asia, said while speaking on human rights before the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, October 22, reports Shaun TANDON for the French news agency-the AFP that the United States “remains concerned” about the impact of India’s actions in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley.
“We have urged Indian authorities to respect human rights and restore full access to services, including internet and mobile networks,” she told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee.
Notably, most vocal critic of Indian action of Kashmir was Representative Ilhan Omar, a prominent first-term Democratic lawmaker and one of the few Muslims in Congress, charged that Kashmir is part of a pattern against Islam by Modi’s Hinduism driven Bharatiya Janata Party.

The Ilhan Omar and Pramila Jaypal’s outburst against India came at a time when the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was rubbing his shoulders with the US veteran diplomat Henry Kissinger and other former world leaders, including Tony Blair in India on Tuesday.
“Kashmiris have been restricted from communicating outside their country for 50+ days. In Assam, almost 2 million people are being asked to prove their citizenship. This is how the Rohingya genocide started. At what point do we question whether PM Modi shares our values? This is what Ilhan Omar questioned while ventilating her inner pains on Kashmir clampdown.
Responding to Ilhan Omar an Indian girl Krittika October 22/19 says this in Twitter: (I) Am an Indian Hindu girl. I know Kashmiris & Indian Muslims are unsafe here. They are sufferings & this affects me a lot. Thanks a lot dear for raising your voice & understanding Indian Muslim problems. God bless you.
In the meanwhile, Rana Ayyub for the Washington Post (Global Opinion) dated October 23, 2019 writes, (sic), “But it’s time to take notice. On Tuesday, participants at a U.S. congressional hearing about human rights in South Asia singled out India’s actions in Kashmir. Francisco Bencosme, Asia Pacific advocacy manager at Amnesty International, said his organization had documented “a clear pattern of authorities using administrative detention on politicians, activists and anyone likely to hold a dissenting opinion before and after Aug. 5” in Jammu and Kashmir.

In the meanwhile, Pakistan ISPR DG says Indian troops have committed 2,608 ceasefire violations in 2019, killing 44 civilians.

Pakistan took foreign diplomats posted in the country to the Line of Control (LoC) on Tuesday to witness firsthand whether the Indian Army had “smashed four terror launch pads” in heavy shelling in the sector two days ago?
According to Pak Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson, the diplomats were taken to the Nauseri, Shahkot and Jura sectors as well as the Nausada village, which suffered severe damage due to the attacks by the Indian troops in the recent days.
Pakistan also invited the Indian envoy for the visit, which the latter refused. No official(s) from the Indian High Commission joined the team visiting the LoC, Dr Faisal said October 22.
“The Indian side did not join the visit to the LoC nor have they provided coordinates of the alleged ‘launch pads’,” the FO spokesperson tweeted.
The consistency with which Pakistan took up the issue of Indian annexation of Kashmir since August 5 has yielded positive results in that the issue has been globalized contrary to the denial of the Indian regime. The US media has above all become vocal.
Indian academics too have begun talking against the Indian government on Kashmiri action of August 5/19.
A fresh news received while writing this story reveals that beginning 25th October, 2019, Moscow will host four-party consultations on the issue of Afghan settlement between representatives of Russia and China, the United States and Pakistan.
India is nowhere in the list of countries meeting in Moscow. Is India out from the entire Afghan peace process?
US Special Envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad is already in Moscow to discuss “shared interests in seeing the war in Afghanistan come to an end” with his Russian and Chinese counterparts, according to the US Department of State.
The US though doesn’t like the Russian entrance in the Afghani affairs. But….
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Ambassador told Muhammad Irfan for the Sputnik-a Russian News agency, that the country’s delegation to the Friday meeting would be led by Additional Foreign Secretary Muhemmed Aejaz, who oversees issues related to Afghanistan.
In yet another ear pleasing news, a fresh move to reinvigorate the “dead” peace talks, China announced it would host Taliban and Afghan delegates in a two-day meeting slated to begin on October 28 in Beijing.
Although there was no official announcement from China, but both Taliban and Afghan delegates have confirmed they received invitation from Beijing.
While Moscow has invited these countries for “consultations” then Beijing has termed the meet to what it calls “reinvigorate”. Wording may differ but the objective is securing peace in Afghanistan. The Beijing meet also doesn’t include India. India is permanently out?

The Nepalese leaders appear to have become more subservient than what they used to be in the previous days and years,




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The net result is the Indian invasion of Nepal continues with full force and the latest being the gulping of entire Kalapani landmass by “ROTI-BETI traditional” neighbor India born 1947.
The posted RAW agents in Nepal prefer to smile looking at their own grand defeat.
These Indo-pendent Nepali paid nationals rejoice as and when India attempts to rape mother Nepal.
However, such phenomenon has become normal since the early 90s. In effect this wonder remains no longer an astonishment for a variety of political reasons more so when the entire system is presumably the gift of the Indian establishment of the year 2005-6.
The general impression in Nepal is that the present System is a gift from India to Nepal.
Be that as it may, just the other day December 20, 2019, a mini seminar was organized in Delhi at the ND Tiwari complex which brought into discussion the issue of the Kalapani encroachment by the Indian security forces.
To recall, Kalapani is a landmass that solely belongs to Nepal since the British India days.
The declared Nepal hater Indian professor Sukh Deo Muni (the real mentor of Comrade Prachanda and Dr. Babu Ram Bhattarai during their New Delhi sponsored People’s War days) said that the issue of Kalapani is nothing but a matter of entertainment for the Nepali people who have come to the streets alleging that India has encroached upon Nepali territory.
What is more than shameful that Nepal’s official Ambassador accredited to India, Shri Nilambar Acharya (rumored to have been preferred by the Indian PM Modi but sent by PM Oli) who was listening to SD Muni’s buffoonery remarks did not utter a single word when his mother country was “blatantly insulted by this self-declared Nepal expert Indian Professor SD Muni.
Professor Muni gave a slight hint that “India too has some authentic documents to prove that Kalapami belonged to India”.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

This perhaps explains as to what sort of Ambassador Nepal has sent to serve in India?
Question thus could be asked as to whether he is serving the Indian interests or Nepal’s?
Reacting to Muni’s rough and dirty comments, Dr. Dwarika Nath Dhungel says that if Muni has the documents then why he is reluctant in sharing those brochures which prove that Kalapani belonged to India?
Dr. Dhungel is a Nepali scholar of international standing.
Yet another former Indian Ambassador to Nepal Ranjeet Rae opined at the same program that “talks with Nepal can’t be initiated at the moment on the issue of Kalapani when a section of the Nepali people is in agitation.
Ambassador Rae thus hinted that India must not talk with Nepal on Kaplapani come what may.
Ambassador Rae is the one who damaged Nepal to the best of his abilities while he was serving India in Nepal a few years ago.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Dr. Dinesh Bhattarai, a former Nepali diplomat however, opined that he has failed to notice any significant positive developments in Nepal-India relations over these past decades despite the high sounding talks on Nepal-India bilateral ties.
Dr. Bhattarai spoke correct.

The standard Indian habit is teasing and harassing the smaller neighbors. Nepal is the weakest of it all.

To recall, the Tamil Tigers have had initiated a secessionist movement in the Island nation which was clearly sponsored and funded by the Indian regime.
It was the brain child of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, matured political observers of South Asia opine.
Talking to this scribe at the end of the nineties in Kathmandu Annapurna Hotel, the retired Indian Foreign Secretary late J. N. Dixit had admitted that sending of the Indian Peace Keeping Force-the IPKF to Sri Lanka was India’s Himalayan blunder. This he has also stated in his voluminous book My South Block Years.
To recall, one Navy young man in Colombo most convincingly hit the visiting Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
That was the Sri Lankan anger exhibited towards India.
However, the three decades long separatist movement carried by the LTTE men headed by India preferred and encouraged dreaded Vellai Prabhakaran came to an end as back as in 2009.
A press conference was hurriedly summoned in 2009 by Sri Lankan Ambassador Hewage to announce that the LTTE menace has been eliminated from the Sri Lankan landscape once and for all.
The Sri Lankan envoy that evening in Annapurna Hotel was beaming for some understandable reasons. His excitement was real.
The entire credit for the elimination of the dangerous separatists from the political scene goes to the then Sri Lankan top leadership headed by President Mahinda Rajpaksha and his defense secretary Gotabaya Rajpaksha.
Thanks Pakistan and China’s “moral” support that this LTTE menace was wiped out.
Though the Tamil terror came to an abrupt end, however, with the sudden landing of the Indian minister Shankar to Colombo a fortnight ago does hint that the Indian minister was in Sri Lanka to impress upon President Gotabaya to award due attention and special rights to the Tamils of the Indian origin or else the Island nation may have to face the same fate as had been in the past decades.
Despite the Indian pressure at the moment, let’s presume Gotabaya is not bowing to the Indian dictates as the India indoctrinated and trained Nepali leaders have been doing since the early months of 2006.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Some declared Indian stooges have been entertaining the Chinese officials in Kathmandu.
An Indian ploy perhaps. Raw “nexus” against China has suddenly become active with the arrival of Shyam Saran a month back.
However, President Gotabaya assured Minister Shankar during the meet that he would be the President “even of those who did not vote for him” during the just held polls.
The Tamils perhaps do not yet favor Gotabaya as per the “designs” of the Indian regime.
Minister Shankar was quick enough to extend invitation to the new President to visit India and while writing this story, the Sri Lankan President has already visited India where PM Modi requested President Gotabaya to devolve power to the Tamils of Sri Lanka.
President apparently is not in a mood to act as per the Indian preferences.
As was expected and warranted, Pakistan’s foreign minister M. Qureshi was already in Sri Lanka and extended a formal invitation to President Gotabaya to visit Pakistan at his convenience. FM Qureshi by this time has already returned to his home country.
In doing so, Pakistan has taken a timely political step that will balance the South Asian politics in many more ways than one.
Interestingly, Pakistan also was quick enough to congratulate Gotabaya Rajapaksa on his victory, like India, and expressed the hope that the new dispensation in Colombo would reverse some of the earlier decisions vis-à-vis Pakistan ( on Kashmir perhaps) according to people aware of the matter.
PM Khan talked over phone with the new Sri Lankan President immediately after the election results.
To recall, the newly elected Sri Lankan President has obtained his military training in Pakistan.
If and when the Sri Lankan President Gotabaya visits Pakistan, he will do so only to reinforce his political commitment that he will follow a policy of equidistance while dealing with the important neighbors in the region.
This also means that even if Gotabaya visited India first but yet this should not mean that he will ignore China and by extension with Pakistan.
The fact is also that President Gotabaya can’t afford to ignore China for multiple reasons and also recalling Colombo’s ties with Beijing in the past.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

In fact, his policy of equidistance means that he will do justice with China as well though he has visited India first under pressure from the known hegemon.
Unsubstantiated rumors have it that the politically strong Rajpaksha brothers prefer China over India for reasons unknown to many political observers but known to those who have specialized on SA politics.
It could be the compulsion of Sri Lanka to counter the Indian hegemony and thus they need Chinese help and have every valid reasons to inch closer to China.
Qureshi has met his Sri Lankan counterpart Dinesh Gunawardena this Monday in Colombo.
This has then set the tone for the visit of President Gotabaya to Pakistan to be followed by China or vice versa.
Let’s hope that China’s foreign Minister Wang Yi lands in Colombo much the same way the Indian minister landed there close on the heels of the declaration of the Sri Lankan election results.
Minister Wang’s Colombo trip as and when it materializes would send appropriate signals to the places where it should approach.
Needless to say, Indian minister Shankar’s visit to Colombo gets neutralized by the visit of the Pakistani foreign Minister Qureshi who is currently in Sri Lanka for a two day visit.
FM Qureshi’s talks with the Sri Lanka counterpart Dinesh Gunawardena is expected to keep the South Asian politics rolling in a better direction as both favor the revival of the India killed SAARC-the regional organization.
President Gotabaya has already made it clear that he will do all he can in order to revive the SAARC body.
With Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and now Sri Lanka ready for the revival of the dead SAARC, India now can do little to object to the majority of the voice from the regional countries that favor the revitalization of the regional body.
If Nepal is the current Chair then it is the turn of Pakistan to hold the stalled Summit of the SAARC. Pakistan must step up its activities in this regards. He is most welcome in Nepal.
To sum up, Sri Lanka and Pakistan being the two powerful countries of the South Asian region have no other option than to increase their “bilateral understanding” in order to keep not only the region safe but also to counter the Indian highhandedness which has terrified the smaller nations that unfortunately share their borders with the goliath.
This they can do through SAARC and other international organizations for the betterment of the South Asian region.
To sum up, the foreign ministers of Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka should travel in the region and lobby for the revival of the SAARC body and enhancing bilateral ties.
This will send the needed political signals where it is needed most.
Thus Pakistan’s foreign Minister Qureshi’s current trip to Colombo has significant political connotations of sort. Its meaning will have greater meaning when the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi visits Sri Lanka and adds to the strength of the Pak-Sri Lanka ties.
FM Qureshi in Colombo talked on Kashmir with the Sri Lankan media. He also briefed the media on regional developments.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said Pakistan and Sri Lanka enjoy longstanding and strong bilateral relations.
Issues confronting South Asia in the recent months were discussed when Qureshi met his counterpart in Colombo on Monday.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“FM Qureshi also briefed his Sri Lankan counterpart on the dire situation and human rights crisis” in Jammu and Kashmir”, news sources said.
FM Qureshi on behalf of Pakistan extended invitation to the Sri Lankan President and also to the Prime Minister.
The Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the Colombo page reported December 2, sought Pakistan’s assistance to boost bilateral trade and eradicate the drug menace plaguing his country when met Pakistan’s Foreign Affairs Minister Shad Mahmood Qureshi on Monday in Colombo.
“Drug trafficking and addiction is a grave evil that my country is confronted with. We wish to seek Pakistan’s assistance to eradicate this menace,” the SL President said.
An expanded Colombo-Islamabad friendship definitely will act like a political deterrent in South Asia, the regional observers hope.
Will these three countries work in this direction? They have to if South Asia is to be kept safe from the malevolent design of the Indian establishment.
China knows it better.
To sum up, the two south Asian neighbors and members of the SAARC body exchanged views on the entire gamut of bilateral relations and matters pertaining to regional and international issues which is a good development for the region.
In addition, the Pak FM Qureshi while meeting Dinesh Gunwerdene said that the two countries having held longstanding trade ties need to reach a higher level of economic cooperation, which at present has not been fully optimized and there is much potential for economic linkages to be strengthened. He highlighted that Sri Lanka is presently not fully utilizing its credit line of USD 200 million with Pakistan and invited Sri Lanka to make use of the opportunity, especially in the animal husbandry area, which would be beneficial for the country.
Minister Gunawardena lauded his appreciation for Pakistan’s partnership in multifaceted cooperation including the steadfast support for the country’s development process.
The Minister stated that this visit is the first to be made of a Foreign Minister to Sri Lanka following the formation of the Cabinet, after the election of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
Minister Gunawardena informed his counterpart that Sri Lanka was committed to continuing the bilateral partnership in all possible areas of cooperation and looked forward to engaging in the fields of tourism and higher education, in addition to the growing bilateral economic partnership.
A great disaster was averted in that the previous Sri Lankan PM Wickremesinghe was so close to India that his attitude towards Pakistan remained damn cold.
Had Sajith Premadasa won the election, it would have been a disaster for Pakistan,” a South Asian diplomatic source said as claimed by the Economic Times dated November 19/19.
The Economic Times further writes that as a young army officer in the early 1970s, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was sent to Pakistan for an officers’ training course at a time when Sri Lanka maintained strong relations with Pakistan.
Later, during the war with the LTTE, when he was the defence secretary under his brother Mahinda’s presidency, Pakistan military supported the Sri Lankan army.
To conclude, it may be recalled that during the 1971 unrest that led to the creation of Bangladesh, after India withdrew landing and overflight rights to Pakistan, Sri Lanka granted refueling facilities to Pakistan International Airlines. This very much speaks of the close ties of the two South Asian nations.
That the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has not wasted time become evident in that he has already met with Wu Jianghao, the Special Representative of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China and Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
“I was pleased to meet with the Special Representative of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China and Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Mr Wu Jianghao and had cordial discussions on China-LKA relations,” the Sri Lankan President tweeted.
The ground reality is that Sri Lanka’s deep ties with China in recent years is, arguably, a consequence of how the Tamil question played out between Colombo and Delhi.
Successive coalition governments in Delhi from 1989 to 2014, which were dependent on the support of the Tamil parties, struggled to balance the pulls and pressures from Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, and Colombo.
Needless to say, Delhi fell between the two stools. Its intervention deeply angered the majority Sinhala community. And the sense of threat from India nudged Sri Lanka to turn to China and Pakistan to balance against its northern neighbor, writes veteran Indian journalist C Raja Mohan in his fresh article December 1/19.
And in fact it was Delhi’s intervention on issues related with the Tamils that Colombo had to make a drift towards Beijing, claim Nepali observers.
This meet with the high Chinese functionary has meaning underneath.
Lastly but importantly, it is no coincidence that President Gotabaya’s inauguration ceremony occurred at an ancient temple built by Sinhalese King Dutugemenu—who is best known for defeating an invading Tamil king from the Chola kingdom.
Has this some meaning underneath? Keep on guessing.
It is time when Delhi will for sure press Colombo to inch closer to it. However, how to balance the ties between a hegemon and a partner in development, China, should be at best be decided by President Gotabaya and his team of seasoned leaders.
Yet for the time being China-Pakistan-Sri Lanka must enhance their ties which could be the desired political deterrent to the India’s regional hegemony in South Asia. What Colombo decides should be final though. Question is: has Colombo the political stamina in keeping Delhi at a comfortable distance sans Beijing or for that matter Pakistan’s help?

String of Pearls: 
For the Road However, the Sri Lankan president’s comments after his meeting with Modi have raised concerns about how the new regime will handle the question of the country’s Tamil minority. Rajapaksa made it clear in an interview to the Hindu that devolving political rights to the Tamil-dominated areas will not be his priority. Rather, he will focus on the regions’ economic development, reports the Scroll.in December 5, 2019.  This hints that Delhi awaits a set back from Colombo. And whether the much publicized String of pearls already in existence?  Or it is in the making? That’s all.  ",/commentary,"Thu, 05 Dec 2019 17:52:34 +0000"
12,http://telegraphnepal.com/imran-khans-stature-heightens-as-narendra-modi-dwarfs/,"N.P. Upadhyaya Kathmandu: Frustrations of the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan are real.
It is simply because none of the world leaders, save a few, with whom he has talked so far on the plight of the Kashmiri people have assured PM Khan of their total commitment and made any criticisms against the Indian highhandedness that it is over the annexation of the Kashmir since August 5/19.
It is the Turkish President Erdogen only who spoke in favor of Kashmir population while making his speech at the UN general assembly session the other day.
However, reports say that Indian foreign minister expressed his serious reservations on President Erdogen’s Kashmir pronouncement in his UN Speech to which the president retorted by saying that should Turkey seek permissions from India to talk on Kashmir?
Rest of the Muslim leaders who have converged in the US to attend the ongoing UN General Assembly session so far though have ignored the Pakistani plea thoroughly but concurrently “sympathized” in private with the plight of the imprisoned eight million Muslim population since 53 days in Kashmir.
This has apparently no political significance.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“Commercial-business” relations have outweighed the humanitarian values” so says the puzzled Prime Minister Mr. Khan.
Says PM Khan that “I have come to New York especially for Kashmir. Everything else is secondary. The World doesn’t realize that we are heading for a big disaster”.
Is he referring to the triggering of the nuclear button if pushed to the wall by India?
This he said while talking to the Editorial board members of the Wall Street Journal on September 25/19.
He further added while talking with the WSJ team that “India’s repressive and illegal actions in occupied Jammu and Kashmir will not only have repercussions for the region (implied South Asian region) but for the entire Muslim world”.
Though the PM may have felt somewhat cheated by the comity of nations in his bid to convince them of the “imminent disaster”, but yet in multiple ways he has conversely been able to draw the attention of the globe by talking with the International media of the sort of Wall Street Journal.
His message has reached far and wide.
The fact is that even the US President Donald Trump appears to be in a state of confusion in that the President remains convinced by what PM Khan has talked with him on Kashmir and thus he wants to mediate, however, the moment President Trump meets PM Modi-he thinks first of business more so in selling of sophisticated weapons to India and earn billions and billions of dollars. A guess works only though.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Even if it were the reality, the US President by this time has already understood how PM Modi had “used” him and his presence in the Houston crowd for gaining “domestic” popularity.
Come 27 September, PM Khan hopes that he will shake the UN general assembly by presenting the Kashmiri issue in a vibrant manner which will, he expects, compel the world leaders to think seriously on the present state of the ongoing Kashmiri plight.
Needless to say, the Muslim leader PM Khan has been somehow or the other been ignored by his own brethren Muslim community of nations.
If Iran came to support the Kashmiris, then the UAE and the Saudis and even Malaysia have completely ignored PM Khan’s plea.
Interestingly, the Malaysian President Dr. Mahathir talked of the Rohingya Muslims at the Colombia University Wednesday but preferred not to touch the Kashmir issue.
With all these setbacks in his bag, yet PM Khan is being taken as “my dear” to the Saudis, the Iranians, and the Americans in that all these three big countries have begun looking upon PM Khan with greater belief and faith hoping that he could be the one who can bring in peace in between these three countries. And Afghanistan is already on the table.
If Iran seeks Pakistan’s help in mending its differences with the USA then equally true is the desire of the Saudis who seek Khan’s good offices to mend its Himalayan differences with Iran which reportedly had attacked some of its oil refineries and caused big damage.
Some even say that the Iranian President landed in the USA only when convinced by PM Khan that things shall change if President Rouhani were to visit the UN general Assembly.
Or is it that the Iranian leader and the US high officials have already talked with each other?
And very interestingly, the USA very much needs the active but subtle diplomatic support in reaching out a peace deal with the Afghan-Talibans which was abruptly disrupted through a tweet released by President Trump a month ago.
Let’s see this in the light of the fact that the US special envoy on Afghanistan has already met with PM Khan in New York.
Thus the Pakistan Prime Minister is placed in such a position wherein he could through the exercise of his political/diplomatic acumen bring in peace in the entire region in and around Afghanistan, Iran, and the troubled Gulf countries.
He must bring in some cards from under his sleeves on such tricky occasions for its effective use.
Nepali observers see the most clever of it all is the Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE who outwardly praise and pose to bestow honor and respect for Imran Khan but in effect it is these countries who could have helped PM Khan but have not for some mysterious reasons. However, they must have their own problems, let’s presume it to have been so.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

In the issue of Jamal Khassogi killing, the Saudi Crown prince is being taken as the villain and this issue may also demand the very mediation of PM Khan at some point. The chances remain high.
But very freshly, we have learnt that Saudi Arabia has joined Pakistan on issue of Kashmiri plight and has joined few other countries who have asked India to rescind its actions revoking Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to which we shall talk later. Much the same way President Donald Trump may have already sought the active support of PM Khan, as stated earlier, to patch up his political differences with President Rouhani and vice versa.
Our own source claims that such a request from both the Iranian and the US side have already been made to PM Khan.
Khan is yet to respond but he will not ignore their requests most likely.
It is here that PM Khan has abundant space to push his main agenda as the bargain chip. But will he present himself in that way? Perhaps his modesty will not allow him to ignore those requests coming as those which will be from Presidents of Iran and USA.
But without the US mediation, the Kashmir issue shall remain hanging for long. Thus President Trump must jump in for timely mediation for the safety of the entire South Asian region which includes the Nepali plea.
Nepal perhaps is the nation in India’s neighborhood that apparently has joined or is likely to join the Indian-protectorate club.

In the meanwhile, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Wednesday expressed its “deep concern” over the worsening human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir with the Indian move to scrap its special status.
In a statement issued following a meeting of its Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir on the sidelines of the 74th session of UN General Assembly in New York, the Muslim body reaffirmed its
stance on the dispute over the Indian-administered region, Islamuddin Sajid for the Turkish news agency Anadola writes September 25/19.
The statement, adds Sajid, “expressed grave concern that India’s actions aim to change the identity and demographic composition of the occupied Jammu and Kashmir and to transform it from a Muslim-majority state into Hindu-majority territory.”
The OIC contact group also deplored on the lockdown of the Kashmiri people, round-the-clock curfew, detention of thousand people, including Kashmiri leaders.
The OIC said the settlement of the issue is “indispensable for durable peace and stability in South Asia and beyond”, informs Sajid for the Turki news agency.
Calling on India to rescind “its actions revoking article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir , Saudi Arabia joined Pakistan, Azerbaizan, Turkey, Niger to issue a statement on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), writes Suhasini haidar from New York for the Hindu Indian daily September 26, 2019.
While PM Modi was busy in praising President Trump at the Texas rally where he even told the Indian audience to vote for President Trump in the upcoming US elections, then around the same time, Imran Khan was pretty busy in discussing the Kashmir issue in details with the Secretary General of the Amnesty International Komi Naidoo, who called on Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday in New York.
PM Khan discussed with Naidoo the dire human rights and humanitarian situation in Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IOJ&K) since India’s illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019.
Prime Minister Imran Khan appreciated the lead role that Amnesty was playing in presenting the real state of human rights in the occupied territory and amplifying the voices of the Kashmiri population in a state of seven-week long lockdown. These efforts had helped raise international community’s awareness about the continuing suffering of the Kashmiri people.
Naidoo, on the other hand in response briefed PM Imran on “Amnesty’s advocacy work on Kashmir including #LetKashmirSpeak”, it has been reported.
Since the Kashmir annexation has negative impact on the overall South Asian security and political stability which is why this paper has made it a point to write against the Indian design in a repeated manner. In some way or the other, its impact could be felt in Nepal also if not the political aberrations corrected on time. Earlier the better.
By the way, the Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad September 25/19 said the NDTV that there is no democracy in Jammu and Kashmir and people are living in fear after the Centre scrapped the state’s special status on August 5.
Mr. Azad was talking to the media as he concluded his six-day tour of the state.
“There is disappointment in Kashmir and the despair is also prevalent among the people in Jammu province. Except 100 or 200 people of the ruling party (BJP), nobody is happy (over the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories),” the former chief minister told reporters before leaving for Delhi.
Mr. Azad, who had on Tuesday arrived in Jammu on the second-leg of his tour, had said the situation in Kashmir is “very bad”.

Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, has said he has been trying to raise the alarm at the United Nations this week, Friday September 27, 2019, about the danger of a nuclear war breaking out over Kashmir, so write Julian Borger in New York and Azhar Farooq from Sri Nagar dated September 26/19 for the Guardian.
The Pakistan PM was speaking to the media in New York September 25 where he said: ‘We are heading for a potential disaster of proportions that no one here realizes.’
Julian Borger and Azhar Farooq further write quoting PM Khan that “President Trump (has) asked me and also Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked me to speak to the Iranians, and we are trying our best that this should not develop into a conflict,” Khan said.
“The good thing about President Trump is that I feel he’s not a pro-war person, although I can see that there are others who are egging him on. But his instinct, quite rightly is not for war … I think that’s very admirable.”
Here is a flash: Yoshita Singh writes Sep 26 (PTI) from the UNGA sidelines that the Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Thursday boycotted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s opening statement at the meeting of the SAARC Council of Foreign Ministers, saying his country will not engage with India “until and unless” it lifts the “siege” in Kashmir.
The meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session here started in his absence.
Minister Shankar also boycotted Qureshi’s speech inside the SAARC meet.
Nepal as the current Chair of the SAARC regional body had convened the SAARC foreign ministers meet. The Pak FM appears to have only avoided Indian FM’s speech. Later he joined the Foreign Minister’s conference.
But this is just one step forward yet.
However, yet all is not lost for PM Imran Khan on Kashmir-the world class cricketer turned political personality who is leading Pakistan.
The political dividends appear to have been in the pipeline.
Many Nepali observers agree that he is a political and nuclear deterrent for the entire South Asian region. A strong Pakistan is what the smaller neighbors of fascist India needs very much for their own safety.
A time soon shall come when the Indo-pendent countries in South Asia shall weep when India will begin coercing them all under the orders of Ajit Doval and Shankar combine.
Reports have it that these two Doval-Shankar Indian stalwarts who dominate the BJP politics leaders. Modi is just working under their whims, it is widely believed.
And that PM Khan is a global player has best been recognized by a British online newspaper The Independent which says after a year of Imran Khan in power as Prime Minister, Pakistan is finally stepping into its role as a world player.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“The message to world leaders is loud and clear: In a dramatic shift from the past, Pakistan is no longer a pawn, a joke, a bystander on the world stage. It is active, engaged, relevant and responsible. This is a dramatic shift from the past, one which may garner greater recognition retrospectively,” adds the British online newspaper Independent in its article published on September 25/19, Wednesday.
On the international stage, Khan’s leadership style is a departure from his predecessors.
Recognition prior to politics, coupled with the promise of “incorruptibility”, signal his diplomatic stature. Incidents such as Pulwama, followed by the Kashmir crisis, put Khan’s diplomatic headship to instant test and both times, he scored, the article said.
The gist:Several requests for him to serve as an honest broker, as we have registered in earlier paragraphs, to mediate between the US-Afghanistan and US-Iran evidences the same confidence. Pakistan has surfaced as a responsible global player; a harbinger of peace with its narrative ubiquitously conveyed, the British online portal the Independent daringly writes.
If so then South Asian region shall ultimately benefit. The deterrence for India is already there now.
In the meantime, the British opposition Labour Party at its annual conference in Brighton passed a resolution seeking intervention by the international community in Jammu and Kashmir.
The resolution asked for the UN led-referendum to resolve the decades old Kashmir dispute.
The resolution submitted by Blackburn, Dudley North, Keighley, Stockport and Wakefield constituency Labour parties condemns the recent actions of the Indian government in the territory, international media sources have confirmed.
Imran Khan is thus becoming a global player? Conversely is PM Modi now a dwarf political personality in South Asia?  That’s all.",/commentary,"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 23:07:57 +0000"
13,http://telegraphnepal.com/us-prez-trump-must-mediate-on-kashmir-to-keep-south-asia-safe/,"N. P. Upadhyaya, Kathmandu: After the US heavy weight Bernie Sanders made some remarks that deplored the Indian aggression on Kashmir, a few more but key US Senators and Congressmen have freshly joined the chorus of Bernie Sanders and urged President Donald Trump to play a constructive role in helping resolve Kashmir and other underlying disputes between Pakistan and India.
In fact these US senators who have a say in the US national politics prefer President Donald Trump to intervene instantly and act as a reliable mediator on the Indian annexation of Kashmir as per his own announcement made July 22/2019 while meeting the Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan at the White House and that too in the presence of international media.
Media agencies have said that through a letter these US political luminaries have appealed their President September 12, to use his good offices and get released the people detained in Kashmir after Aug 5-the day India annexed the occupied valley.
Those who have jointly sent the letter to the US President are learnt to be Senators Chris Van Hollen, Todd Young, Ben Cardin and Lindsay Graham who have also expressed concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in Kashmir and urged him to use his influence on Pakistan and India to come to terms and resolve the Kashmir issue to the satisfaction of the Kashmiri people.
Interestingly, the senators have also noted that on Aug 5, the Indian government “unilaterally revoked Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which afforded autonomy to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.”
The use of the word unilateral here is meaningful which explains so many things unspoken.
In a fresh development, some Kashmiri citizens currently in the US have filed a lawsuit in the United States against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for carrying out extrajudicial killings and other crimes in occupied Kashmir.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The lawsuit, as per the available media reports, was filed just days before Modi is scheduled to speak at a major rally called “Howdy, Modi!” in Houston, Texas, where he is expected to be joined by US President Trump.
The lawsuit, according to the Houston Chronicle, was filed by a pair of unnamed US-based Kashmiris.
The newspaper has identified the attorney as Gurpatwant Singh Pannu of Kashmir Khalistan Referendum Front.
Pannu is widely known as the legal head for ‘Sikhs for Justice’ (SFJ), which is a banned outfit in India.
Besides Modi, the Wire reports dated 20, 2019, the filed lawsuit also names home minister Amit Shah and the general officer commanding of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps, Lieutenant Kanwal Jeet Singh Dhillon. They have been accused of “extrajudicial killing” and “wrongful death, battery, emotional distress, crimes against humanity”.
Interesting is the fact that the Indian Prime Minister Modi has been recognized “as an undesirable character till fairly recently”.
After the Gujarat massacres in 2002, under his watch as Chief Minister, many countries of the world including the United States had placed a visa ban on Modi.
Countries like the UK and many EU countries had done the same, however, it is these countries now who embrace the “massacre man” as and when they happen to meet this South Asian Hitler that he is taken by the South Asian population.
India’s satellite countries including Nepal have termed the August 5 aggression of Kashmir as “internal” matter of India to which it definitely is not.
In a dramatic development, quite in contrast with the Persian Gulf’s Arab countries, for example, the Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, which have either supported India’s abrogation of Article 370 or have had a subdued response on Kashmir, Iran has taken a position against New Delhi. Given the Islamic Republic’s tendency to balance positive relations with both India and Pakistan, its decision to oppose India in this instance is notable. It raises questions as to whether, and how, the elimination of Kashmiri autonomy could impact Iranian-Indian relations, writes Giorgio Cafiero September 20.
Iran’s express support to the Kashmiri issue is somewhat puzzling in view of the fact that the “intimate” friends of Pakistan such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE and some other countries in the gulf region have more or less just lured Pakistan.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

But yet these countries helped Pakistan at a time when PM Khan needed “money” to help save the country, if one were to recall.
To recall, On August 21, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei took to social media to call on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to reverse its actions in Kashmir.
He said, “We have good relations with India, but we expect the Indian government to adopt a just policy towards the noble people of Kashmir and prevent the oppression & bullying of Muslims in this region”, adds by Giorgio Cafiero.
However, Talking to Al Jazeera TV networks September 14, 2019, the Pakistani Prime Minister much ahead of heading to the US via Saudi Arabia to take part in the UN General Assembly spoke his mind if in case of a sad event unfortunately that brings the two nuclear states, India and Pakistan, close to a conventional war then what he or his country in the given condition would do?
“If Pakistan is forced to embrace a conventional war and if a country is stuck between the choices: either you surrender or you fight ’till death for your freedom, I know my countrymen will fight to death for their freedom. So when a nuclear-armed country fights to the end, to the death, it has consequences.”
This makes it clear that if pushed to the wall, Pakistan would have no choice other than to think of the nuclear option and what would this mean is any body’s guess, so signaled the Cricketer turned Prime Minister Imran Khan.
In order to avert the disastrous consequences that may result from the choice of the Nuclear option the PM says, “So that’s why we have approached the United Nations, we are approaching every international forum, that they must act right now because this is a potential disaster that would go way beyond the Indian subcontinent.”
PM Khan however, gave a subtle hint to the Al Jazeera TV that the imminent war in between India and Pakistan could very much be averted if countries engaged now in the verbal war could see sense and understand the gravity of the emerging dangerous situation’ and act accordingly.
Khan says, “I’m glad they say I’m a prime minister of U-turns. Only an idiot doesn’t do any U-turns,” Khan tells Al Jazeera. “Only a moron, when he’s on a course and he comes across a brick wall, only that stupid idiot keeps banging his head against a brick wall. An intelligent person immediately revises his strategy and goes around it.”
This means that if PM Modi changes his stubbornness and arrogance and come to terms with what has already been specifically told and dictated by several UN resolutions in the past then the Kashmir issue could be settled. He perhaps hints at the possibility of being “flexible” if the Indian side soften its hardened stance.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

To recall, very recently Pakistan went to Geneva and approached the UN Human Rights body and secured the sympathy of some forty plus countries who through a joint statement shared the concern expressed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet regarding the impact of recent actions of the Narendra Modi government on the human rights of people of occupied Kashmir.
Now this issue shall very much reverberate inside the Hall of the UN General Assembly within two weeks or so.
India and Pakistan may collide at the UN general assembly lobby this September end.
Nepal may bring both the rival nations, India and Pakistan, in the same table on the sidelines of the UNGA, as the SAARC Chair, it is talked. Hope wisdom prevails on both the rival countries.
At a different plane, the Amnesty International which remained so far tight lipped on the Kashmir upon being questioned by several international bodies has, better late than never, launched a petition on its website urging people to raise their voice against the government-imposed communications blackout in India-occupied Kashmir that has been in place for over a month.
It is perhaps approaching 50th dark day in Kashmir after the August 5 illegal annexation.
The AI says, September 15, 2019, in part, that nearly 8 million people have been living through a communication shutdown since August 5,” the human rights organization stated on its website.
AI statement has come only after several media organizations alleged the Amnesty as to have been clearly taking the sides of the Indian establishment on Kashmir aggression.
While writing this story, the Octogenarian Chief Minister (former) of Kashmir, Farooq Abdullah, has been arrested under a draconian law called the Public Safety Act (PSA).
He has been detained inside his house which equals now to a jail.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

In the meanwhile, the Indian top court said on Monday, September 16/19 that the federal government should restore normal life in Kashmir as soon as possible, as a partial shutdown of the disputed region entered its 42nd day, so writes Suchitra Mohanty and Alasdair Pal for the Reuters, Delhi.
“We direct Jammu and Kashmir to make the very best endeavor to make sure normal life returns,” India’s Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said on Monday, after a panel of three judges heard several petitions relating to Kashmir, which is also claimed by Pakistan, adds Suchitra
Even after the Indian Court orders, situation in Kashmir remains the same. Delhi appears to have ignored the SC verdict.
It would not be out of place if we reproduce here to what the first Prime Minister of the Republic of India J.L. Nehru had stated as back as in the Indian Parliament on August 7, 1952.
Nehru had said then, according to senior analyst A.G Noorani that “It is an international problem. It would be an international problem anyhow if it concerned any other nation besides India and it does. It became further an international problem because a large number of other countries also took interest and gave advice…. We do not want to win people against their will and with the help of armed force, and if the people of Jammu and Kashmir State so wish it, to Part Company from us, they can go their way and we shall go our way. We want no forced marriages, no forced unions like this…( A. G. Noorani, The Wire).
Writes A. J Noorani in his fresh article “Is Kashmir a Domestic or International Issue? Published in the Wire dated September 15/19 in the Opinion column.
In fact, analyst Noorani recollects to what PM Nehru had stated then.
Noorani remembers what Nehru had stated on July 8, 1949, wherein he (read the Indian PM Nehru) had clearly stated that “Kashmir is a world question”.
Says Noorani, “he was all for mediation and had said on November 12, 1949, at a press conference in London that “India continues to suggest that there should be mediation and that this mediation should be under the auspices of the United Nations partly because we want to increase the prestige of the United Nations.”
Two questions arise claims A.J Noorani in the same article that “When did India resile from this stand, and why? Has the world deferred to this volte-face? The second is easily answered. At the recent G7 Summit at Biarritz, France, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ruled out mediation but not the fact that Kashmir is a dispute between India and Pakistan to be resolved bilaterally.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

This was the stand he took, writes A. G Noorani, in talks with US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron.
Modi had said that “All the issues between India and Pakistan are bilateral in nature.”
The existence of the issues is surely an affirmation implicitly of the issue–Kashmir.
President Trump said on August 25 that Modi and he had discussed Kashmir “at great length”. Clearly, Kashmir is no internal matter is this. So sums up A. G Noorani his thought provoking article in the Wire.
Abdul Ghafoor Abdul Majeed Noorani, known popularly as A. G. Noorani, is an Indian lawyer, constitutional expert and political commentator.
He has practiced as an advocate in the Supreme Court of India and in the Bombay High Court. (Source Wikipedia).
Good news for the South Asian region: PM Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan will address the UNGA the same day, on September 27.
Imran Khan is likely to speak within minutes of Narendra Modi’s speech September 27/19. Khan hopes that China remains a reliable partner even at the UNGA to get the world’s ear on Kashmir.
Nepali observers are confident that for the resolution of the Kashmir issue in between India and Pakistan, the US President Trump must jump in for mediation in between the two rival nations at the earliest if he wants to avert the threat of war that looms over South Asia.
The US President must mediate on Kashmir-dispute or else the SA region is doomed. President Trump must save South Asia from the new fascist leader in India-PM Modi. That’s all.",/commentary,"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 19:29:18 +0000"
14,http://telegraphnepal.com/indian-action-on-kashmir-unacceptable-senator-bernie-sanders/,"N.P. Upadhyaya Kathmandu: The US heavy weight has better late than never spoken on “Kashmir occupation” carried out by the Indian Union on August 5, 2019.
After his comments made on India’s Kashmir aggression last month perhaps nothing remains to be spoken by other world leaders on Kashmir.

He weighs high even if several world leaders speak collectively against his remarks and thus he has authentically stamped that Kashmir has at best been occupied by the Indian establishment and that India should act in a way that the UN resolutions have already dictated on Kashmir.
It was an occupation of Kashmir, so implied the US towering personality.
In doing so, he perhaps ensured the entire American-Pakistani votes for himself in the upcoming US Presidential elections.
Bernie Sanders of the US Democratic Party while addressing the audience at an event hosted by the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) that he was “deeply concerned” about the situation in Kashmir and has also asked his own US government to “speak out boldly” in support of a UN-backed peaceful resolution to resolve the lingering issue.
His thundering speech may have jolted the entire US Administration. President Trump too prefers a solution to the issue however, his political inclination for a variety of reasons impede his ways that doesn’t all him to press India hard.
It is perhaps the Indo-Pacific Card.
Making a fiery speech at the annual convention of the Islamic Society of North America in Houston on last Saturday, the 77-year-old leader also sought an immediate end to communications blockade in Kashmir.
The reverberations of Bernie’s speech must have approached Delhi-the capital of the Hindu-fascist regime.
Kashmiri people since 30 days plus have been imprisoned by the Central Government of India. The brutality appears to have no end in sight.
The septuagenarian US leader Bernie says, “India’s action is unacceptable,” while addressing one of the largest Muslim gatherings in the country in decades.
“I am deeply concerned about the situation in Kashmir and thus the Indian action in Kashmir is unacceptable,” Bernie added.
Bernie thus has hit the nail right on the head of the Indian PM Modi.
Bernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, said the crackdown on dissent in Kashmir “in the name of security” impedes the access to medical care. Unfortunately, Bernie Sanders has not been told of the Nepal’s misery brought about by the Communist thugs for the common people of Nepal.
Is Bernie listening? For God sake please listen to the killing of democratic system in Nepal by the Communists.
To Pakistan’s utter surprise, Bernie Sanders is a Jew who has joggled the entire US management by taking the just side of the “majority” Kashmiri people (the Muslims who apparently do not wish to mingle with the Jews).
In Nepal however, this scribe once brought the Ambassadors of Pakistan and Israel together and they not only shook their hands but since then became good friends.
(The names of the Ambassadors have been withheld for some exclusive reasons).
Pakistani leadership should now think on how to initiate diplomatic ties with Israel.
I recall, how the Indians in the early seventies used to hate the Israelis in Kathmandu. And now perhaps it is the Indian government which is perhaps most close to the Israeli state.
Modi hugs Benjanim Netan Yahu as and when they meet each other either in Delhi or in Jerusalem.
India by inching closer to Israel has enhanced its military strength in various sectors.
Initiation of diplomatic ties with Israel will be a good proposition for Pakistan despite the idea may be taken as a cultural-religio shock to the majority Muslims inside Pakistan. The Oxford graduate PM Khan perhaps will take up the issue for the benefit of his nation though he may counter some problems in the initial days.
The rest depends on the Pakistani leadership led by Imran Khan. But yet as far as I recall, PM Benazir Bhutto have had definitely tried “secretly” to land in Israel but in the meantime some political glitch thwarted the entire secretly planned trip to Israel.
At least this was the rumor in Kathmandu then as far as this scribe recalls.
After Bernie Sanders criticism of India on Kashmir, Professor Larry Diamond at the Stanford University in one of his fresh articles touches upon Kashmir.
Let’s look what he says: “In the face of sometimes brutal and even deadly state repression, the courageous mobilization of ordinary citizens, standing up for their rights, should inspire all of those who live in established, liberal democracies. At the same time, the ill winds of strongman populism, intolerance of minorities, and readiness to eclipse constitutional norms—which have already eviscerated democracy in countries such as Hungary, Turkey, and Bangladesh—now cast a shadow over the future of democracy in the Philippines, Poland, and India, particularly with the recently reelected Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dismissal of the state government in Kashmir. (He missed referring Nepal).
Dr. Diamond says, “Without the support of the U.S. government, pro-democracy forces around the world will wither as authoritarianism gains ground.
His saying applies to Nepal’s case as well as the ruling communists have become like oppressor. The Nepali population instead of enjoying democracy are being ruled by authoritarian rulers. People may revolt any time.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

A quick look into the gist of Dr. Diamond’s article one can get that this veteran political scientist feels pained by the fresh Indian attack on Kashmir. He is not happy with the summary dismissal of the state government in Kashmir.
He says this in his article titled “America’s Silence Helps Autocrats Triumph” published in the SEPTEMBER 6, 2019, ISSUE OF THE FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE.
Coming back to Israel, Some Arabian countries too secretly have been trying to break the age old taboos and initiate ties with Israel, it has been learnt from high placed international commentators.
Prior to the Jew Bernie Sanders, it was Ms. Ilhan Omar, once again a US Democratic senator who had talked in favor of the Kashmir population who have been living in a hellish conditions since August 5 under the shadow of barbarism of the Indian military forces since last month. And now it is Dr. Larry Diamond who has spoken on Kashmir. Sympathy is increasing in favor of the Kashmiri “imprisoned” people.
The tragedy with Pakistan is that she has no “effective lobby” in Washington D. C. The absence of an effective Pakistan lobby in the USA is what has perhaps been the greatest failure of Pakistani diplomacy which has been hurting Pakistan in many more ways than one. The facts speak for themselves.
But yet, some British law makers have acknowledged that the Kashmir issue is an internationally recognized dispute and awaits the “implementation of the relevant UNSC resolutions.
They have also noted with concern the tragic situation of “human rights” as well as the blockade imposed by India which has led to a severe humanitarian, political and security crisis in the “occupied territory”. (Courtesy Twitter September 4, 2019).
The Pakistan PM Khan has some good news for the Indian Sikhs together with the entire Sikh community scattered all over the world who as pilgrims visit Kartarpur and Nankana Sahib, as well as other Sikh holy sites in different cities of Pakistan.
Addressing a Sikh conference in Lahore PM Khan has assured the Sikh community that his government will make all efforts to facilitate pilgrims who visit Kartarpur and Nankana Sahib, as well as other Sikh holy sites in different cities of Pakistan.
In all his modesty, PM Khan said that “This is not a favor, this was our duty”.
The prime minister expressed his concerns over the situation in occupied Kashmir, saying: “No one who has any humanity left (in them) can tolerate the current situation in Kashmir. We can never accept that you place eight million people under lockdown for several days and cut off all communication. I would have raised my voice even if they [Kashmiris] were [non-Muslims].”
At the end of his speech the PM said “he realized that Kartarpur and Nankana Sahib were as holy for Sikhs as Makkah and Madina were for Muslims, and promised to make access for Sikh pilgrims as easy as possible.
PM Khan’s positive gesture must have pleased the attending Sikh pilgrims who were listening to his speech in Lahore inside the convention hall.
International commentators now have valid reasons to believe that the Sikh community shall now work as “Peace Ambassadors” in between the two rival countries.
Khan’s Lahore speech too would have its own sort of impact on those Sikhs who have been championing for the cause of Khalistan. The Canadian Sikhs will celebrate for some exclusive reasons. It is expected to boost in its own way the slogan of Khalistan referendum-2020.
And PM Khan mentioned that a day may come soon when the Sikhs shall be the target of the BJP party. The RSS shall not spare the Sikhs, Khan hinted.
Look how PM Khan made the Sikhs to believe that the BJP threat was not only real but sure to hit the Sikhs sooner than later.
In the meanwhile the Pakistani Army last Thursday said it had successfully test-fired a nuclear-capable surface-to-surface ballistic missile called Ghaznavi.
The missile is capable of “delivering multiple types of warheads up to 290 km”, said armed forces spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor.
This came amid rising hostilities between Pakistan and India since New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status earlier this month.
India’s Chandrayan has already landed in the Moon, it has been learnt.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

PM Khan has recently talked with the French President and the Jordanian King close on the heels of the launch of the Ghaznavi ballistic missile.
Definitely, the launch of this missile must have added strength to its military might whose impact must have approached Delhi-the seat of RAW and the Hindu terror machinery.
Responding to PM Khan, the French President highlighted the significance of resolution getting sought through a nonviolent ground while he also lauded Pakistan’s continuous efforts of bringing about peace in Afghanistan.
Abu Arqam Naqash for the Reuters writes that a Kashmiri militant commander has said on Sunday that Pakistan should send troops to protect the people of India-controlled Kashmir if the United Nations does not send peacekeepers, after New Delhi revoked its autonomy last month.
Mr. Abu Arquam Naqash further adds that “It’s binding upon the armed forces of Pakistan, the first Islamic nuclear power, to enter into the India-occupied Kashmir to militarily help the people of the territory,” Syed Salahuddin- the militant commander- who heads an alliance of over a dozen groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, said reports Reuters dated September 1, 2019.
Along with the Indian atrocities the Kashmiri population have been made to suffer since one month or so, the news covering international media too have been telling their ordeals while noting down or for that matter taking related photographs of the security forces atrocities in India held Kashmir.
Media man Mr. Rifat Fareed for the Al Jazeera writes September 1, 2019, that
“As the crippling lockdown in Indian-administered Kashmir nears a month, journalists in the region complain of harassment by authorities, with many accusing security forces of deleting their camera footage and pressure to report “normalcy”.
“This is a unique situation, writes Rifat that none of us had seen anything like this in the past. Even in the worst of times in Kashmir, we were able to file our stories,” said Muzaffar Raina as he waits to access his email at a Media Facilitation Centre in the main city of Srinagar.
The India-Pakistan conflict will definitely have a negative impact on the US wish for an honorable and early exit from Afghanistan so writes Anwar Iqbal for the Dawn Daily.
“The developing situation in India-held Kashmir might negatively impact the Afghan peace process, warns a US think tank as a congressional subcommittee scheduled a hearing to review the situation in the valley.
Media man Anwar further writes that “Pakistan has been playing a significant role in the recent US-Afghan peace negotiations with the [Afghan] Taliban. The Kashmir issue may not only detract Pakistani resources and political will away from Afghanistan but potentially could also be used as leverage to persuade the United States to intervene with India,” the US think tank report adds.
The reason is very simple in that “The Afghan peace talks are in their final phase and the US and Taliban delegations are now holding their ninth meeting in Doha, Qatar, to finalize a deal. But reports from Doha indicate that Washington may fail to conclude a deal by Sept first week as it had been expected.
A fresh news from Kabul says that the U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has returned to Qatar for more, unscheduled talks with the Taliban.
His return comes just four days after Khalizad announced that his team had reached an agreement “in principle” with the Taliban aimed at ending the longest war ever to ensnare the U.S. military.
When he announced the draft agreement on last Monday, Khalilzad said his negotiations with the extremist group had concluded and that the deal lacked only approval from his bosses in the Trump administration, writes CBS this morning dated September 6, 2019.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The delay, if any per chance, will further enhance Pakistan’s role in persuading the Taliban to stay engaged with the US. But what if an annoyed Pakistan dilly-dallies the US requests?
Pakistan media believes that President took a U turn from what he had assured PM Khan on July 22 at the White House.
Naturally if Pakistan fails in managing an early and dignified US exit from Afghanistan as promised, the US shall perhaps conclude that it may have been so due to the Indian actions on Kashmir which deflected the attention of Pakistan towards Kashmiri people plight or else Pakistan would have acted according to its words given to the President of the USA.
Before we conclude, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United States Asad Majeed Khan said the international community “must do more” to pressure India to end its militarized curfew over Kashmir. Ambassador Majeed said this in Washington said claiming that India’s prime minister has turned a vast section of the disputed Muslim majority region into “practically a concentration camp.” He was talking to the reporters of the Washington Post in the recent days.
All in all, Bernie Sanders taking up the Kashmir issue and Pakistan’s own Ghaznavi ballistic missile strength have made its impact in its own way.
To conclude with Kashmir again: The military lockdown and communications blackout imposed by the Indian government following the revocation of the region’s autonomy last month has crippled life in the Muslim-majority Kashmir region, so writes Adnan Bhat for the Al Jazeera dated September 6, 2019.
Mr. Adnan adds, the unprecedented siege, which entered its second month on Thursday, has severely affected patients in need of urgent medical attention and better facilities.
That’s all.",/commentary,"Fri, 06 Sep 2019 19:23:21 +0000"
15,http://telegraphnepal.com/1299-2/,"N.P. Upadhyaya, Kathmandu: Nepali Congress parliamentarian Pradip Giri spoke of the chances that if India so desired can gulp Nepal a la Sikkim or at best make Nepal another Bhutan.
Some even claim that he was told to speak so but we are not sure whatever he said was his own “brain” or an injected statement?
Whatever it may be, let’s not discuss it in details as the “rest” we understand better.

Nepal’s Foreign Minister Pradip Kumar Gyawali, in fact a crane elevated political man, changed his statement on Kashmir once again. But yet he is a modest political creature.
Prior to the arrival of BJP card holder S. Jay Shankar in Nepal, Indian aggression on Kashmir was an issue that, he said, demanded bilateral talks between Pakistan and India and that the occupation in Kashmir by India could destabilize the South Asian region. This he has said as the SAARC Chair.
This is what he used to say which had in fact surprised many a brains in Nepal as to how he “could dare” to make a statement that went opposite to what India desired from this satellite state ( close to a protectorate).




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Mr. Shankar appears to have jolted Nepal during his Kathmandu stay hinting to await for yet another Economic Blockade and apparently for fear of losing the ‘current post’ and also for averting the blockade, “made” our foreign minister to speak while attending a meet in the Maldives that “since it was an Indian constitutional matter and thus whatever she does with the constitution should not bother us”.
Gyawali in an indirect manner admitted to the utter shame of the Nepali population that Nepal has already went to the lap of the Indian regime. There should now be no illusion in the political acumen of “nationalist” KP Sharma Oli and his ministers.
Who they are stands now exposed. But with this Nepal’s existential threat has come to the front.
But whatever our elevated Minister says of Kashmir to please India, the fact will remain a fact and the fact is that Kashmir has now taken an international dimension and the world community have been talking of the plight of the Kashmiri population beginning the black day of August 5, last month.
Beijing must have understood as to where Nepal stands and how the Nepali leaders should be taken on any international issue, for example Kashmir.
Now Nepal has also pegged its foreign policy with India’s as the Nepali currency has been tied up with the Indian currency. The next step is merger with the Indian Union? Isn’t Mr. Foreign Minister?
Shame on entire Nepali population including this scribe. Nepali people should now mourn the demise of Nepal’s Non Aligned Policy which had kept us all along “sovereign and independent”. The rest is history now.
Again back to Pradip Giri: Giri later clarified that Nepal should adopt a competitive-smart diplomacy which is equipped with the ability that allows Nepal to talk straight with the Indian side and push its grievances in a free and frank manner. (Isn’t he talking the absurd?).
Gyawali was coerced by Shankar and so he chose to change his stand on Kashmir not from the Nepali soil but pleased India by being in the Maldives.
We sympathize with our Foreign Minister. But if he has the habit of changing his statements every now and then with the change of places then let’s presume that he can once again change his statement on Kashmir if he is in Bangladesh or is back even in Nepal.
Thanks Shyam Saran for this Republican order. Grand but loaded gift you installed.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Mr. Shankar, the one who pressed Minister Gyawali hard is a highly qualified but heartless personality whose meanness we have already experienced during the last Indian blockade imposed on Nepal in the year 2015.
If taken in the light of the erratic behavior of Minister Shankar, Mr. Giri is correct but the manner he presented his saying inside the Parliament was simply frightening.
Some even took Giri’s talk as to have been a “subtle” signal from the Indian regime through NC parliamentarian Pradip Giri.
Nothing is impossible in RAW controlled Nepal, it is not only talked but strongly believed.
Needleless to say, after Giri’s bombshell, here comes the real villain of Nepal-the Indian Viceroy Manjeev Singh Puri who apart from his “micro-managing” of Nepal in earnest has begun travelling districts after districts collecting the needed and the required “information” of some Nepali political leaders perhaps with an avowal that “time permitting” which of the leaders of Nepal could be “used and overused” for securing and ensuring the security interests of the Indian establishment prior to materialize ‘the target Sikkim’.
His travel here and there could be, some say, to change the regime even.
Ambassador Puri was found asking how much popular Bhattari is. This perhaps explains the Indian design which could be in the pipeline.
RAW, says an estimate, is present even in areas where Nepal government is absent.
Only the Indian Ambassador(s) have the exclusive rights in Nepal to move freely without seeking the “required and the needed” permission from Nepal’s foreign Ministry.
Sovereign and Independent Nepal has turned into the personal fiefdom of the Indian Ambassador Manjeeb Singh Puri.
He is the undeclared ‘His majesty the King of Nepal’, as the people have begun taking him these days. Shame on all of us. Removing the real King we have brought this alien King.
Listening to the plight and the unequal treatment meted out to them by the Central Indian government, Nepal’s Gorkha soldiers apparently have approached the Nepal Government in the recent months which is why the Nepal Government has tentatively told the Indian establishment in no uncertain terms that “Let’s bring out some substantial improvement in the Nepal-India-Britain tripartite treaty that governs the Gorkha recruitment both in the former British Colony, the Indian republic and the Colonizer-today’s United Kingdom.
The Gorkhas serving in Britain too have begun demanding equal treatment at par with their British Counterparts.
While writing this story, what has come to our notice is that the Indian government in a calculated manner made null and void the Indian citizenship of those Nepali population who have been living in Assam for more than centuries.

The exodus of the Indian-Nepalese is likely to begin and they will definitely enter the country of their ancestors.
But the story doesn’t end here.
A comfortably qualified intellectual with ….bend has joined the Pradip Giri’s structured strategy if it could be taken as that.
This gentleman openly says that Nepal must trim its military strength and do not think of bringing in of a benevolent dictator.
For the record, such a statement has come to our knowledge decades and decades after but it came at a time when the nation has yet to analyze the inner meanings of what Pradip Giri meant when he said that “should India so desire, Nepal can easily turn into Sikkim.
The threat to Nepal’s existence thus is increasing from none other than from our own distinguished intellectuals. Are these Nepali nationals Nepal’s real enemies? Who knows?
I am in full knowledge and now could recall that trimming of the Nepal Army was primarily “suggested” by sitting Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai during the early nineties.
He advised the then monarch King Birendra to think upon the proposal pushed by him, read PM Bhattarai, for downsizing the military strength in Nepal.
A puzzled King, (let’s presume so) must have been traumatized internally by his Prime Minister’s somehow or the other an “anti-national” proposal.
However, the King without feeling disturbed and losing his cool composure told the Interim Prime Minister Bhattarai that, (sic) “ Look PM, I know that neither Nepal Army can fight with India nor with China for long. But yet don’t you think that the Nepal Army shall keep Nepal sovereign and independent for a few more minutes or even as long as an hour if the unexpected happens”?
A pin drop silence prevailed for few minutes in between the King and his PM. The PM got the message and he since then dropped the army trimming idea.
It was this Prime Minister who during his first visit to India signed a Nepal-India joint communique dated June 10, 1990 which was no less than a “Treaty” with India which made Nepal over dependent on India as if the Indian dependency were not enough.
So guess where the tilt lay of this Nepali Prime Minister? (RIP).
Some Nepali nationals “love and honor” India more than their own motherland. But why? Keep on guessing.
Now after decades and decades, this high flying intellectual once again has floated the same idea which had then been pushed by Nepal Congress highest functionary-Krishna Prasad Bhattarai.
Draw your own conclusions if you can and understand as to why this “slogan” of downsizing of the Nepal Army has cropped up at this critical time? What could have been the real motive? Whose instructions are being followed and why?
Yes. Nepal Army’s track record too is not that lovely. Our national Army is as many business sectors as could be handled from catering to constructions of …..
Our “once upon a time distinguished” Nepal Army is yet to try to open Saloon and Beauty parlors et al. This should not mean that we have no trust on our Army.
Though we have high regards for the Nepal Army, however, the Army’s track record is dismal after the advent of this republican order.
Nepal Army must begin soul searching.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Yes Nepal should be ready to cut the strength of its army if India, the source for Nepal threat for existence, accepts Nepal’s Zone of peace Proposal.
The ZOP pushed by Nepal King Birendra was to keep Nepal free from the Indian threat. India did not recognize Nepal’s Zone of Peace proposal though some hundred sixteen countries have had endorsed the Nepali proposal including the US under President Ronald Reagan.
India’s summary denial means that Nepal’s existential threat remains intact and that too from the fascist India which has very freshly annexed Kashmir-an internationally recognized disputed territory awaiting UN plebiscite.
If India guarantees Nepal’s continued existence as a sovereign nation (keeping some powerful countries as guarantors) then Nepal would be ready to cut down the size of its almost “redundant” army which has, thanks, kept itself engaged in a joint drill with the Chinese Army as of now.
All in all, Nepal is being encircled by enemies, some paid and some working voluntary perhaps. But who shall work for free in these hard times?
No wonder then one Indian retired RAW functionary has asserted that “we in the RAW dismantled the Nepali monarchy and facilitated the entrance of the Republican order in Nepal by convincing Comrade Prachanda”.
But yet our political animals claim that they were instrumental in the advent of the Republican order. Is this Bihari national Amar Bhusan, the author of the book “Inside Nepal” is correct or what our politicians bark is the reality? The RAW gentleman should have also mentioned as to who the media men were who helped the RAW initiative then in lieu of hefty Indian currency? He however, kept it a secret for reasons that could be understood…
Now when the RAW admits then what remains to be told?
However, the RAW officials’ version of overthrowing Nepal’s monarchy with the tacit assistance of the Delhi residing Comrade Prachanda is being given a twist and being termed as a “fiction”.
Why is this bending of the fact? No wonder it so happens in Nepal. That’s all.",/commentary,"Thu, 05 Sep 2019 19:36:30 +0000"
16,http://telegraphnepal.com/beijing-yet-to-correct-lipulek-blunder-chinese-envoy-meets-nepal/,"The UML senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal is the single Nepal’s political personality, among the crowd, who has maintained “balanced” policy while dealing with Nepal’s immediate neighbors-both South and North.
True to Nepal’s balanced policy, Mr. Nepal talks high of India while being in Indian Territory and has very high regards for the Northern neighbor, China, when he is invited by the Chinese authorities. He knows how to balance the ties.
In fact he is the only one who has realized that Nepal was in reality a yam in between two boulders as had been defined by Nepal’s Unifier Late King PN Shah long time ago.
In a way thus Mr. Madhav Nepal could be taken as the one who has kept this country so far non-aligned or say have maintained equidistance or even practiced the notion of equi-proximity in the foreign policy conduct of Nepal in her dealings with both India and China.
Very recently, Madhav Nepal was in China wherein he assured his Chinese hosts that Nepal shall honor all those agreements and protocols that have been inked by China and Nepal in the past and thus the Chinese must not suspect that Nepal may not remain true to its made commitments with China.
Needless to say, Mr. Nepal who equally is close to the Indian establishment and thus he may convince the men in the Indian establishment, including PM Modi, with the same vigor and energy to how he takes the Chinese into confidence as and when he lands in the Indian soil.
Nepal as a nation-state is fortunate to have such a son, as Mr. Nepal, who is in himself a pride of the entire nation at least in the domain for foreign policy who could balance the tricky ties of Nepal even in between the two giants, the Dragon and the Elephant in an easy manner.
The Kathmandu based Chinese Ambassador paid a courtesy call on Mr. Nepal on Monday and had a very fruitful discussion in between the two wherein the present state of Nepal-China relations were discussed.
During the meeting, Mr. Nepal is reported to have requested the Chinese envoy to think of the very proposals of Nepal wherein the latter needs greater road connectivity’s with the adjoining autonomous region of Tibet, China.
In the meantime, the Indian PM Modi is all set to meet President Xi Jinping, April 27-28, wherein the two leaders are to “reset” their disturbed ties with each other during the Doklam incident.
Analysts are afraid of that as and when Modi meets President Xi, the former may “reset” Nepal’s relations with China as we, the Nepali population, have had witnessed during the Lipulek issue.
To recall, China and India had mentioned the inclusion of LIPULEK area for their bilateral trade without consulting Nepal as the Lipulek land mass belongs to Nepal.
A blunder that China has yet to correct.  China takes Nepal as one of its reliable partners though.
The Chinese envoy perhaps met Madhav Nepal in Kathmandu to remind the senior UML leader that Nepal FM Pradip Gyawali have had an intensive discussion with the Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan on Nepal-China relations when the former was in China and that the verbal agreements made then by the two must be taken due care of.
Ji Liang writes, ( Source Twitter) that, “Wang Qishan met with Gyawali and expressed the hope that the governments of China and Nepal will jointly implement the existing consensus and agreements and take the construction of the “Belt and Road Initiative” as an opportunity to push bilateral relations to a new height.
Whether Madhav Nepal requested the Chinese envoy to correct the Lipulek blunder or not remains yet a puzzle.

17,http://telegraphnepal.com/nepal-india-may-float-hindu-king-card-against-china/,"Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah has conceivably set the ball rolling.
Indications to this effect have begun trickling in the political talks here and there, beyond the borders as well, in the recent days and weeks.
Hardly had it been a fortnight or so wherein the King had advised the various splinters of the party of the former Panchas, the RPP, in Himalayan Tea Estate situated in the Jhapa district, to get united and thus form a formidable democratic force to match with the increasing threat( implied perhaps) of the left alliances which has emerged as a Himalayan force that has practically threatened the New Delhi regime to the extent that each and every leader together with some lanky and fatigued diplomats in collaboration with the self declared Nepal experts have been spitting venom against the Communist government that has taken a formal shape in Nepal led by Prime Minister KPS Oli.
The outdated and mentally retarded New Delhi based diplomats, who have had served in Nepal longtime ago such as Kawal Sibbal and SS Mukherjee, Shyam Sarana and Rakesh Sood, to name a few, feel that Nepal’s new Left coalition bodes ill for the entire South Asia, read India in their myopic analysis, as such a coalition which has a distinct and dangerous tilt towards China-the arch rival of India since 1962 humiliating debacle, as far as Indian security is concerned.
( India of late has toned down its political overtones being usually made against China).
These luminaries having limited knowledge on Nepal fear that the Left coalition shall invite China in a much bigger way which India can’s match in Nepal and thus minimize or say impede the manner they have had been micro-managing Nepal with the tacit assistance of the domestic leaders, government bureaucrats, envelope-media men, so called India experts, the JNU returnees and et al, to which India wants to remain intact.
Two such defunct Indian diplomats are now in Nepal to spy on PM KPS Oli. The two were the ones who brought Nepal-India relations to ever observed new low in the recent history. The pretext is trekking.
The fear of the Chinese factor is real but yet the Indian establishment is so deep rooted in Nepal that for several decades to come, India can have its easy going in Nepali affairs thanks to the prevalence of the Nehruvian doctrine in Nepal beginning the grand escapade of late King Tribhuvan to Delhi in the 1950, if one were to recall.
King Gyanendra still counts of New Delhi regime. Perhaps is hoping against hope. However, he is free to hope as it is not a crime to hope at all in a democracy. As a common Nepali national he too deserves the right to hope and dream.
To come to the point. The former Monarch while saying that the fractured RPP leaders should unite for the greater cause of the nation has also been heard well within the RPP and beyond such as the Nepali Congress which is also struggling, as observers claim, to keep its existence intact in the Nepali political arena. Delhi too is one of the listeners of his Jhapa appeal.
Very interestingly, Kamal Thapa, one of the Chairmen of the RPP splinters has in a determined manner vowed that his party shall never abandon the notion of democracy together with the reinstatement of the Nepali monarchy. Thapa has also said that his party shall ever favor the reinstatement of the Hindu religion in Nepal. Thapa hopes that the street movement remains always an option.
More or less in the same manner, the Nepali Congress General Secretary Dr. Shashank Koirala too has spoken that his party should now think on the lines of late Khum Bahadur Khadka who when alive had been advocating the reinstatement of the Hindu religion in the country by declaring making the secular term null and void.
Dr. Shashank Koirala in the recent months, more so after the fresh election debacle for the NC, had said reportedly that the NC should not have abandoned the notion of Democracy with Constitutional monarchy together with the prevalence of the Sanatan Dharma, that is the Hindu religion.
Dr. Koirala made such remarks very freshly during a program organized to mark the 13th day death rites of the departed NC leader KB Khadka who left for his heavenly abode in Delhi’s Apollo Hospital.
If we put all these pieces together then a clear picture emerges which signals in many more ways than one that the Hindu or say its synonym “Nepal King Card” is the brain child of the frustrated Indian regime which has been thinking that such a card if and when used may counter the increasing threat of China due to the overwhelming majority of the Left Coalition in Nepal.
However, the fact is that this left Coalition has some Indian brains with Nepali souls. Kamal Thapa is very close to the Indian PM Modi and the former Nepal Sovereign was recently in UP wherein he met with Aditya Nath Bista yogi, the Chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India. Later he went to Oddissa and accepted the title of World’s Hindu Emperor. The message is loud and clear.

18,http://telegraphnepal.com/diplomatic-win-of-nepal-pm-oli-in-india/,"As the old saying goes, experience is the best teacher and that more one is subjected to delicate and susceptible tests over time, he or she is bound to bag successes more so if such tests belong to the domain of diplomacy then the one concerned subjected to such tests as stated earlier masters the art of diplomacy, including the dos and don’ts in the conduct of international relations more so in the standard behaviors that guide the ties in between the two neighboring countries, which later allows him or her to converse with the other side keeping heads high and answer the queries in a more discreet way that keeps the questionnaire guessing as to how to take the most sensitive answers just received?
Such answers usually possess double meaning and are vague in its real meaning that forces one to pull the hairs for being unable to get the exact clue to what has been said by the concerned diplomat or the authority in question.
Nepal PM Oli has mastered this art not by attending to the school of international studies but instead the post that he carries with him over these years, with interruption though, in a repeated manner has made him more like a seasoned diplomat who could handle any situation and face any awkward question with proper care and give a befitting reply that satisfies the questionnaire.
Nepal PM Oli’s statement in Delhi that “we never had any differences over our bilateral ties…and even we have had any misunderstanding then those too have by now vanished”.
Such meaning loaded statement can only come from a seasoned player who understands better on how ties with immediate neighbors need to be handled without causing any further damage to the strained relations as they are at the moment with Nepal-India ties.
Problems remain yet PM Oli managed to sound his hosts that there was nothing to panic.
Oli in saying so in Delhi has proved himself that he can win over easily the Indian PM Modi who by fluke of a chance has assumed this post or else he was more suitable and comfortable with the profession that his august father had initiated and continued for decades on the sidelines of a railway station as PM Modi has himself beamingly said several times in the past.
This scribe found PM Oli presenting himself in Delhi as a smart diplomat who understands well on how to win the hearts of his own people back home and entertain the hosts in Delhi.
The absence of the word China in Oli’s statements did miracle in many more ways than one. First, the absence must have assured his Delhi hosts that, at least internally, even if Oli visits China soon, nothing as such dangerous would happen in Nepal-India relations so happily nursed this time by PM Modi and his coercive babus who in effect control Modi in the conduct of his foreign policy.
Secondly, Oli gave the impression that though he was a Nepali national but was made for India and that he has yet not forgotten the debt of the Medanta Hospital treatment in the not so distant past.
The Indian authorities took Oli as a normal Nepali PM visiting Delhi but failed to capture the inner minds of the Oli who has changed himself after the fresh economic blockade imposed on Nepal.
All that Oli did in Delhi was to keep a calm posture all along in his dealings with the hosts without disturbing the minds of the Delhi babus for he knew that mental disturbance remained in store for them when he lands soon in Beijing and meets the Chinese President Xi Jinping and inks several agreements with China or receives assurances that the previously agreed agenda(s) shall be completed on time. China perhaps understands better Nepali haste.
Barring SD Muni, the self declared Nepal expert who possesses a special hatred for Nepal and its people, suspected the credentials of Nepal PM Oli for having a visible China tilt after the blockade and suggested his own government to act in a manner that does away with Oli’s nationalist credentials and distances him far from China. Source Twitter.
SD Muni read the inner minds of Nepal PM Oli as regards his China tilt but did not acknowledge that such a tilt, if any, was by default and was the making of the Indian regime itself. (Professor Muni also talked with the Rajya Sabha TV together with disruptive and most arrogant Ambassador SS Mukherjee and a Nepali media man Parsuram Kafley).
Whether Oli sold the nation to India at a dirt cheap price or extracted benefits is not known but yet what could be guessed in advance is that PM Oli, should he so desire and his cabinet colleagues support him in his develop Nepal mission, then he can extract huge benefits for Nepal by keeping both the immediate neighbors at a comfortable distance by adopting to what he has recently spelt out: “balanced relations”. But what is this balanced relation? Is it maintaining equidistance or equi-proximity? Will PM Oli or his foreign ministry officers make it a point to further explain the notion of balanced policy? Or does it mean that after visiting India, it should be China that balances the relations with the immediate neighbors? Who knows how this balanced policy shall be brought into practice in Nepal’s dealing with the Dragon and the elephant in the Oli era?
All said and done, PM Oli’s political acumen and his diplomatic strength await yet another crucial test while he confronts the Chinese heavy weight President Xi Jinping.

19,http://telegraphnepal.com/india-to-seduce-nepal-pm-oli-during-visit/,"All is not well in Nepal.
A very disturbing news has been made public by Dristi weekly dated April 3, 2018, that authentically claims that Nepal’s foreign minister is not in good speaking terms with his own party President who is also the country’s Prime Minister.
According to the weekly, FM Gyawali in a very surprising manner recently said that he got to knew that the Nepal Prime Minister was visiting New Delhi through the media only.
If true then what could well be guessed in advance that PM Oli’s trip to New Delhi will bring in no specific gains for Nepal as the Foreign Minister himself has no in-depth knowledge of the PM’s Delhi visit.
But our own sources claim that the Indian Ambassador Mr. Puri has met FM Gyawali several times in the recent weeks and that in such meetings between the two they both must have talked about the impending visit of Nepal PM to Delhi that begins shortly.
What could be more dangerous for a nation like Nepal whose Prime Minister and foreign minister do not share their ideas and views on the visit they both are scheduled to embark upon within a week or so?
Some say that PM Oli’s visit to India is agenda less and that no political matters as such shall be discussed or brought to discussion while Nepal PM Meets his clever counterpart in Delhi.
Yet those who understand Delhi better claim that India as usual press Nepal this time also to assure the host country about the “guarded safety” of its flimsy security concerns.
The Nepali river capture and other arm twisting agenda must have been there which Nepal PM has to face while being in Delhi. Guaranteed.
India of late has been alarmed by the China’s increasing influence in Nepal and feels insecure that Nepal may allow China to approach close to Nepal-India borders.
Just the other day, the Chinese envoy, Ms. Yu Hong, landed in Bhokraha and Laukahi villages situated very close to Koshi river and met with the Koshi flood affected Nepali population.
In addition to this, Indian concern has increased manifold with the sudden arrival of the Pakistani Prime Minister Abassi for a whirl wind tour to Nepal last month.
The Pak Prime Minister was greeted in Nepal in a befitting manner to what he deserved.
With these developments seen in Nepal after the India imposed economic blockade, Delhi thinks that Nepal-China-Pak trilateral schemes were in the offing aimed at teasing India and India alone for long time to come.
To recall, India’s domineering presence in South Asia has seen a dramatic slide in the recent months wherein either China or Pakistan have entered into the playground considered to be the sole preserve of the Indian establishment.
The manner Pakistan Army Chief had been greeted by the Maldives government must have strained the brains of the South Block mandarins.
As if this were not enough, the Sri Lankan President was the guest of honor during the Pakistan national day celebrations.
All said and done, Nepal PM Oli is thus expected to receive a red carpet welcome in Delhi this time. Oli may be seduced by PM Modi not to cause more tensions to Delhi by inviting China closer.
Nepal PM Oli, as has been claimed by high placed sources, is all set to embark on a meaningful visit to China just upon his return from New Delhi.

20,http://telegraphnepal.com/if-nepal-ceases-to-exist-where-shall-we-live/,"Numerous issues, logical and illogical both, political apolitical as well, have gripped Nepal as of now. Nothing is new in gripping Nepal with problems both homegrown or the imposed ones.
We have now developed adequate stamina on how to cope with, or rather say, live with such traumatic and humiliating issues and problems over these Loktantrik years that have stretched to decades by now.
Such trends have now become the hallmarks of new Nepal, frankly speaking. We have developed immunity to insults thanks to the ruling elites of new Nepal.
Nepal experiences such threats every now and then since the political change that we the people preferred in lieu of the other one- the controlled system perhaps as it was dubbed then by the opponents then who have been ruling the nation in these democratic years- that was in place for well over three decades or so. It is altogether a different matter that “we the people” lauded and greeted the new changed system hoping against hope that the changed system of governance shall bump up or at least try to elevate this country and bring at par with what had been assured of Singapore and Switzerland, if one were to recall the good old days of early 1990s.
Nothing of that sort is visible as had been promised by our fiery leaders then.
In effect, honestly speaking Nepal as it stands today has become radar less country which has lost its actual direction and has been made to swing as the men in charge of the nation droop by the external elements’ dictates and sermons. This is true, however, “we the people” for fear of being penalized do not dare to speak out these facts. But the fact is that while being in search or assurances made by leaders of a brand new Nepal, we have lost the original Nepal wherein we the people lived together in harmony for centuries. Now the deeply rooted communal harmony has vanished in the ethereal medium to the extent that we the people prefer to fight with each other on even some flimsy pretexts or the other.
So who brought such a division amongst the Nepalese of various shades and colors? This question demands logical answers from sociologists and experts who have studied, before and after the so called political change, the common qualities of the Nepali people. Now it is time that these experts guide we the people on how to proceed together in complete harmony with each other in the changed context. If not then the oldest nation of the world, that is Nepal, may eventually go to the dogs and it will be “we the people” to suffer for long time to come. The leaders may switch on their allegiance and submit themselves to the mercy of aliens as had happened with Sikkim. Just a reminder only.
Bids are afoot to destabilize us. Clandestine efforts are being made to tear apart the nation. Some extraneous forces, known and unknown both were hell bent on pushing this country to a point of no return. Inimical forces near and far have posted their trusted sleuths, albeit paid ones, in order to weaken us further so that they could exploit required political benefits from a completely ravaged Nepal. We are on that path knowingly or even unknowingly.
Mind it that if Nepal ceases to exist, where shall we live? Perhaps this question should now boggle the minds of the sensible and motherland loving Nepalese nationals. Furthermore, this piece has not been written for educating the traitors but instead it is dedicated for those who love mother Nepal unconditionally.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“There is a strong commitment to eliminate malaria in the Region, reflected in the commendable intense efforts and progress being made by member countries.  This momentum needs to be sustained and further accelerated to prevent, rapidly detect and treat malaria, to benefit everyone, everywhere,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director WHO South-East Asia.
As per the World Malaria Report released today, in 2018 WHO South-East Asia Region had an estimated 8 million cases and 11 600 malaria deaths – 69% and 70% less as compared with 2010. This is the largest decline among all six WHO Regions.
Two countries in the Region – Maldives and Sri Lanka – have been certified malaria free, and two more, Timor-Leste and Bhutan, are close to elimination target.
Despite being the highest burden country of the Region, India reduced its reported cases by half as compared with 2017. Bangladesh and Thailand also reported substantial decline in reported cases.
All countries in the Region are on target to achieve a more than 40% reduction in case incidence by 2020, and all have strategic plans for malaria elimination by 2030.
However, despite progress, an estimated 1.61 billion people in the Region continue to remain at risk of malaria with the disease being endemic in 9 countries.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“We need to intensify efforts, particularly at the sub-national and grassroots levels, with multi-sectoral collaboration, to strengthen surveillance and reach the most vulnerable and marginalized communities,” the Regional Director said.
Better implementation of treatment regimens, to effectively manage drug resistance and relapsing disease, needs to be focused upon, she said.
We also need to further strengthen cross-border collaboration as malaria free countries would always remain at risk of importation from neighboring endemic countries. Joint efforts to rapidly detect and respond to importations and prevent and protect vulnerable communities along the borders is vital in our drive to achieve zero malaria and protect everyone everywhere, the Regional Director said.
The WHO South-East Asia Region, home to one-fourth of the world’s population, has been prioritizing malaria elimination. Member countries adopted a ‘Ministerial Declaration on Accelerating and Sustaining Malaria Elimination in the South-East Asia Region’ in November 2017, reaffirming their commitment and emphasizing the need for new funding and technologies to keep up the momentum to end malaria by 2030.
This was followed by a Call to Action adopted by countries of Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) May 2018. The Six GMS member countries, two from WHO South East Asia Region – Myanmar and Thailand –  have stepped up collaboration to address resistance of malaria parasites to antimalarial drugs, including artemisinin, by eliminating malaria altogether from the Mekong by 2030.

The progress and challenges in malaria elimination are periodically reviewed by member countries. In September 2018, all member countries renewed their commitment and once again resolved to end the scourge of this life-threatening disease.

Mr. Benny Omer, Ambassador of Israel to Nepal said, “I really appreciate all the farmers who were stimulated by the knowledge, skills and experience they gained from Israel and have started implementing their knowhow here in Nepal with the significant amount of money they saved in Israel. This is a great contribution to the modernization of agriculture.
Besides, it helps to shape their future and is an important element in national economy too. He further said, “We should encourage more females to participate in the L&E Program and to work in the farm upon their return.”
Speaking at the event, H.E. Dr. Anjan Shakya, Nepali Ambassador to Israel said, “Israel has been supporting Nepal in agriculture and many other sectors. I recently visited Arava farm in Israel and met Nepali students working in the farm. I found that most of the students are very happy, satisfied and are learning effective modern agricultural practices.”

The Asia-Pacific Declaration on Advancing Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment: Beijing+25 Review was adopted after intense negotiations at a three-day Ministerial Conference, organized by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the UN Women Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific this week.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“The 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action is an opportunity for us to take stock of our progress and accelerate efforts. I am delighted member States from across Asia-Pacific have seized it and agreed an ambitious forward-looking Declaration which strengthens the region’s commitment to action on gender equality and women’s empowerment,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Armida Alisjahbana.
“The significance of this region being able to adopt this Declaration today, which articulates clear and strategic actions to be taken to address the gender agenda, cannot be overstated,” highlighted United Nations Assistant-Secretary-General and Deputy Executive Director of UN Women Anita Bhatia.
While Asia and the Pacific have made remarkable advancements so far, the Declaration notes several emerging megatrends slowing the progress of gender equality and women’s empowerment in the region, such as climate change, intensifying disaster risks, growing digital divide, rapid urbanization, rising inequalities within and between countries, and increasing acts of violence and extremism against women and girls.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The Declaration recognizes women as key contributors and vital agents in combating poverty and inequalities and calls upon governments to ensure inclusive social protection systems, public services and infrastructure.
With its adoption, countries also committed to ensure women’s economic empowerment and the integration of women into the formal economy. Governments agreed to take appropriate measures and extend legal and social protections to ensure that all women and girls have equal opportunities for education, decent work, favourable conditions of work and financial inclusion.
Countries further committed to work together with key stakeholders to transform negative gender norms, discriminatory social attitudes and to eliminate structurally unequal power relations that persist between women and men. They additionally highlighted the need to strengthen gender-responsive national statistical systems and data collection for an enhanced understanding of gender gaps in the region.
Governments also called upon ESCAP to continue serving as a regional and sub-regional platform to promote greater dialogue and cooperation among countries. The Declaration mandates ESCAP, in collaboration with other UN agencies, to support relevant national institutions in monitoring and implementing the global Beijing Platform for Action commitments.
The Declaration will serve as the regional input to the 64th session of the Commission on the Status of Women on the global review of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in New York next March.

The ten day programme, organized in different cities of Nepal was inaugurated by President of Nepal Bidhya Devi Bhandari and was attended by dignitaries and participants from across the region.
Pakistan, a powerful member of the SAARC regional body, is participating in South Asian Games with a contingent of over 300 male and female participants in different sports. South Asian Games is one of the largest Sports events in the region which started in mid 1980s. Fourth and Ninth South Asian Games held 1989 and 2004 were hosted by in Pakistan.
The Pakistan Minister is on a three-day visit to Nepal during which she is expected to hold high-level interactions with the Nepali leadership before her return to Pakistan on Tuesday. These interactions would likely focus on enhancing cooperation in the areas of sports as well as youth interactions. The two countries will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations next year.

With not many high level visits taking place between the two countries, the current visit is being viewed as a step towards strengthening the bilateral relations especially at a time when Nepal is preparing to celebrate 2020 as the ‘Visit Nepal Year’.

26,http://telegraphnepal.com/who-intensify-action-to-eliminate-violence-against-women/,"Kathmandu: Violence against women is a serious threat to women’s health and well-being. Globally, an estimated 35.6% of all women experience physical and/or sexual intimate partner or non-partner violence in their lifetime. In the WHO South-East Asia Region, the figure is almost five percentage points higher, at 40.2% of all women. Violence against women can significantly impact mental health, leading to anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse and suicide. All forms of violence against women, including rape, can cause adverse sexual and reproductive health outcomes such as sexually transmitted infections, unwanted pregnancy, low birth weight and premature.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

This has been stated in a Media Statement by WHO South-East Asia Regional Office November 25/19.
The press note further states;  The health sector has a key role in responding to violence against women and informing the quest to eliminate it. Health workers are likely to be the first professional contact of survivors of physical and/or sexual intimate partner or non-partner violence. Ensuring appropriate post-violence care is accessible to all women and girls, including adolescents, is an important part of achieving universal health coverage, which is one of the Region’s eight Flagship Priorities. WHO is working with Member States in the Region to fully implement WHO’s global plan on addressing interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls. WHO is also supporting Member States to make full use of the WHO-co-developed RESPECT women framework for preventing violence against women, which several UN agencies and development partners launched earlier this year.
As a first step, health systems should adopt standard, gender-sensitive guidelines and protocols on the provision of post-violence care. All health facilities and health workers should have the capacity to implement them. Services for injuries and sexual and reproductive health are crucial, as is mental health support. WHO’s clinical guidelines on responding to intimate partner violence and sexual assault are an important resource for health workers at all levels. Region-wide, they should be fully leveraged, including as part of pre-service and in-service training.
It is imperative that health systems have clear procedures for identifying and documenting cases of violence against women. Surveillance of the problem is key to better understanding its prevalence, especially among different groups of women. That in turn informs cross-sector prevention efforts such as behavioral change campaigns, economic empowerment initiatives or legal and justice reforms. Research and evidence-building is crucial to designing locally appropriate, high-impact preventive interventions.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

To advocate for intensified action at the highest levels, the health sector should join forces with other sectors that prevent or respond to violence against women. High-level political buy-in will help secure the resources needed to increase awareness and modify behaviors. It will also help empower women’s organizations working at the grassroots, in addition to building society-wide coalitions that can address the problem at its source.
In the wake of the Nairobi Summit earlier this month, which marked 25 years since the UN’s landmark International Conference on Population and Development, global momentum to empower women and advance gender equality is at a premium. The WHO South-East Asia Region is no exception. WHO reiterates its continued support to Member States to ensure health systems have the capacity to effectively respond to violence against women and can inform action to prevent it. Women’s rights are human rights. Together we must intensify action to eliminate violence against women and girls.

He at the moment has been vocal against the continued Indian occupation of Nepali landmass here and there and everywhere-from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the West.
India since the next day of the end of its slavery from the British India Company has been gulping the lands of the smaller neighbors.
Sovereign and ancient nation Nepal has been the worst hit by the expansionist country-India.

This legal professional Mr. Nepal is creating awareness among the people who know little about the Indian habit of invading the territories of weaker neighbors.
He is Swagat Nepal who apparently has vowed to free mother Nepal from the continued Indian assault and in the process has been holding demonstrations, rallies and talk programs to let the people understand the Indian trickery.
Many now in Nepal believe that India is a world acclaimed trickster whose main business is political thuggery.
Needless to say, India’s paid agents could easily be found in Nepal’s political and media sector.
It is said that Nepal is weak simply because most of the Nepal’s political leaders approach Delhi to sort out their internal problems.
Addressing a grand crowd Friday afternoon, senior lawyer Swagat Nepal suggested the lame duck government led by Prime Minister KP Oli to immediately declare the incumbent Ambassador M.S. Puri a persona non grata (PNG) and sound the Indian government to cut the numerical strength of its massive staffs from Kathmandu based Indian embassy.
Ambassador Puri is talked have been micro-managing the functioning of the Nepali State affairs.

Some even talk that in the fresh reshuffle of the Oli cabinet, Ambassador Puri has been able to insert “two ministers” of his choice in the new cabinet.

During the Friday speech November 22/19 at Maiti Ghar Mandala, Mr. Nepal said that the Indian Prime Minister Modi was a horrible Hindu fanatic and that he could be taken as a Hindu Terrorist who has terrorised the entire Muslims and the Christians living inside the Indian Union.
“India has gulped Nepali land with the tacit consent of the present day Nepali leaders”, said Mr. Nepal hinting that the country was weak only due to the subservient attitude of the Nepali political animals towards the Indian establishment.
Mr. Nepal questioned as to why the nationalist leaders like Chitra Bahadur and Narayan Man Bijukche ” Rohit” were not invited to the “meet” summoned by the Nepal Prime Minister in garnering political support from the Nepali parties on the issue of the land encroachment by India?
How can it be called a national unity by omitting Mr. KC and Bijukche Mr. Nepal quizzed?
“Ulterior motive of the government is understandable”, claims Mr Nepal.
How the Prime Minister could then claim that he enjoys the support of entire political parties on Kalapani when the reality is that the PM has ignored Mr. KC and Bijukche?
He in effect, adds Mr. Nepal, invited all those parties who were in many more ways than one close to the Indian establishment.

“This is a ploy of Nepal Prime Minister to dilute the Nepali stance on Kalapani while dealing with the Indian Union”, concluded the legal brain Mr. Nepal.

28,http://telegraphnepal.com/nepal-to-tackle-diabetes-strengthen-primary-health-care-says-who/,"Kathmandu: Diabetes is a significant threat to public health across the WHO South-East Asia Region. An estimated 91 million people in the Region suffer from diabetes. Around 49 million – more than half – are unaware they have it. Undiagnosed or poorly controlled type 1 or type 2 diabetes can lead to heart, kidney, and nerve or eye damage. It can also lead to premature death, which in the Region accounts for just under 50% of all deaths caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Preventing and controlling NCDs is one of the Region’s eight Flagship Priorities.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

As part of the Region’s primary health care approach to tackling diabetes, families must be empowered to act. Families have an important role in creating awareness of the risks of diabetes, including overweight and obesity. They can also instill healthy habits such as physical activity that help prevent diabetes, including its early onset, which in the Region is high. In addition, family members are often the first to identify diabetes’ signs, symptoms, risks and complications. When complemented by access to quality primary health care, families are an important asset in the battle against diabetes.
The Region’s Member States are taking decisive action. All countries have developed national multisectoral NCD action plans. Each plan contains specific interventions to tackle diabetes. Their roll-out has occurred alongside Member State efforts to strengthen primary-level NCD services, which will also help the Region achieve its Flagship Priority on universal health coverage. Several opportunities exist for the Region to sustain and accelerate its progress and achieve the ‘25×25’ and Sustainable Development Goal targets. Each of them should be grasped.
First, all families should have access to educational resources on diabetes. This can be done via social and behavioral change campaigns that highlight the family unit’s role as a first line of defense. Campaigns should also outline how families can work together to develop healthy habits. This is particularly important given most diabetes cases are type 2, meaning they can be avoided by healthy eating and adequate physical activity.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Second, access to healthy environments should be increased. The creation of green spaces and outdoor gyms will facilitate exercise and the weight management it brings. So too will efforts to reformulate unhealthy food and drinks and enhance people’s ability to make healthy choices. Though these measures go beyond the health sector, health authorities should act as nodal agencies, working across sectors to find high-impact solutions that also reduce health care costs.
Third, all families should have access to quality primary health care. Primary-level services must be equipped to detect diabetes, including the high and rising incidence of pre-diabetes. A reliable supply of quality medicines and medical products that can help manage cases should be on hand. Each of the interventions outlined in the Colombo Declaration on accelerating the delivery of NCD services at the primary level, which the Region adopted in 2016, must be fully implemented.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The Region’s efforts to halt the rise of diabetes by 2025 and beyond must continue. It must also be scaled up. On World Diabetes Day, WHO reiterates its commitment to supporting Member States tackle diabetes via a multisectoral, primary health care approach that empowers families. Together we must fight diabetes. Together we can win.

The recently published map by India showing western border of Nepal is totally false and misleading, on the basis of historic maps (1 February 1827 and 24 April 1856, published by the British Survey of India), prepared on the spirit of Sugauli Treaty.
Everybody should protest to this new false and misleading map.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

According to the historical maps of 1827 and 1856 and some other maps published by the British Survey of India; not only Lipulek, but also Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belongs to Nepal.
These maps depict the river Kali, as per the spirit of the Article 5 of Sugauli Treaty-1816.
The recent map published by India is nothing more than (a desire) to swallow the encroached Nepali territory of this area.
We have to be very careful and hate this type of fabricated Indian maps.
Why India published the new map may be that forthcoming seventh meeting of the Nepal-India Joint Border Working Group is taking place in Kathmandu after three months.
It may be inferred that the Kalapani area at that time should have been published now to produce map proofs by India.

Buddhi Narayan Shrestha
When India prepared the small scale map of Uttarakhand, this area was found to be delineated with India. The backdrop of creating new maps and spreading them everywhere is that the map of Nepal, which was placed under ‘Nissan Impressions or Court of Arms’ in Schedule-I of the Constitution of Nepal, has to be accidentally blackened.
However, in all the maps published by the Survey Department of Nepal, the Lipulek-Kalapani is delineated within the Nepal border. However, it was missing accidentally to extend the Nepali border up to Limpiadhura.
Whatever it may be, in order to strengthen and deepen the bilateral relations between Nepal and India; mutual dialogue, trust, understanding and coordination must prevail to resolve the encroachment issue forever by amending / revising the boundaries drawn on the new map of India.
On the other hand, Nepal should form a ‘Think Tank on Boundaries’ to prepare technical / diplomatic document with facts & figures, maps & images, past incidents & experiences and devise ways & means to resolve the border issues with India which has  encroached Nepali landmass.

“I take this opportunity to congratulate the authorities for the results achieved in the agriculture sector since the launch of the Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS): agriculture services have been extended; export earnings have risen; and irrigation and rural connectivity have progressed, says Ambassador of the European Union in Nepal Ambassador Veronica Cody.

The Ambassador Veronica adds, “in addition, reforms of the legal framework for land management and agribusiness activities, including agriculture markets, are underway”. Accountability measures have also been strengthened with the establishment of annual costed plans and a monitoring framework. The EU shares the importance that Nepal attaches to agriculture and remains a strong partner in this sector”, the EU Ambassador Veronica Cody further reiterates.
“Nepal has fulfilled most of the policy commitments agreed with the EU for the release of the first disbursement under the programme, as evidenced by the increase in the total value of processed dairy products from NPR 18.9 billion in 2014/15 to NPR 27.1 billion in 2017/18”, the Ambassador explains.
Similarly, 994 agriculture and livestock technicians were deployed to local governments during the year 2017/18. Moreover, progress on the legislative area is also underway, with a new bill on land management, and the preparation of a new bill on agribusiness promotion. These are important accomplishments for agriculture in Nepal at a time when the country is transitioning to a federal form of governance.
 
In addition to agriculture-specific commitments, the EU disbursement assessment also takes into account progress related to reforms in the fields of public financial management, existence of stability-oriented macro-economic policy and progress on budget transparency and oversight, the Ambassador adds.
The EU is providing technical support to further strengthen the ADS implementation and its monitoring framework, states the EU Press release.

The standard Indian habit is teasing and harassing the smaller neighbors. Nepal is the weakest of it all.

To recall, the Tamil Tigers have had initiated a secessionist movement in the Island nation which was clearly sponsored and funded by the Indian regime.
It was the brain child of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, matured political observers of South Asia opine.
Talking to this scribe at the end of the nineties in Kathmandu Annapurna Hotel, the retired Indian Foreign Secretary late J. N. Dixit had admitted that sending of the Indian Peace Keeping Force-the IPKF to Sri Lanka was India’s Himalayan blunder. This he has also stated in his voluminous book My South Block Years.
To recall, one Navy young man in Colombo most convincingly hit the visiting Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
That was the Sri Lankan anger exhibited towards India.
However, the three decades long separatist movement carried by the LTTE men headed by India preferred and encouraged dreaded Vellai Prabhakaran came to an end as back as in 2009.
A press conference was hurriedly summoned in 2009 by Sri Lankan Ambassador Hewage to announce that the LTTE menace has been eliminated from the Sri Lankan landscape once and for all.
The Sri Lankan envoy that evening in Annapurna Hotel was beaming for some understandable reasons. His excitement was real.
The entire credit for the elimination of the dangerous separatists from the political scene goes to the then Sri Lankan top leadership headed by President Mahinda Rajpaksha and his defense secretary Gotabaya Rajpaksha.
Thanks Pakistan and China’s “moral” support that this LTTE menace was wiped out.
Though the Tamil terror came to an abrupt end, however, with the sudden landing of the Indian minister Shankar to Colombo a fortnight ago does hint that the Indian minister was in Sri Lanka to impress upon President Gotabaya to award due attention and special rights to the Tamils of the Indian origin or else the Island nation may have to face the same fate as had been in the past decades.
Despite the Indian pressure at the moment, let’s presume Gotabaya is not bowing to the Indian dictates as the India indoctrinated and trained Nepali leaders have been doing since the early months of 2006.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Some declared Indian stooges have been entertaining the Chinese officials in Kathmandu.
An Indian ploy perhaps. Raw “nexus” against China has suddenly become active with the arrival of Shyam Saran a month back.
However, President Gotabaya assured Minister Shankar during the meet that he would be the President “even of those who did not vote for him” during the just held polls.
The Tamils perhaps do not yet favor Gotabaya as per the “designs” of the Indian regime.
Minister Shankar was quick enough to extend invitation to the new President to visit India and while writing this story, the Sri Lankan President has already visited India where PM Modi requested President Gotabaya to devolve power to the Tamils of Sri Lanka.
President apparently is not in a mood to act as per the Indian preferences.
As was expected and warranted, Pakistan’s foreign minister M. Qureshi was already in Sri Lanka and extended a formal invitation to President Gotabaya to visit Pakistan at his convenience. FM Qureshi by this time has already returned to his home country.
In doing so, Pakistan has taken a timely political step that will balance the South Asian politics in many more ways than one.
Interestingly, Pakistan also was quick enough to congratulate Gotabaya Rajapaksa on his victory, like India, and expressed the hope that the new dispensation in Colombo would reverse some of the earlier decisions vis-à-vis Pakistan ( on Kashmir perhaps) according to people aware of the matter.
PM Khan talked over phone with the new Sri Lankan President immediately after the election results.
To recall, the newly elected Sri Lankan President has obtained his military training in Pakistan.
If and when the Sri Lankan President Gotabaya visits Pakistan, he will do so only to reinforce his political commitment that he will follow a policy of equidistance while dealing with the important neighbors in the region.
This also means that even if Gotabaya visited India first but yet this should not mean that he will ignore China and by extension with Pakistan.
The fact is also that President Gotabaya can’t afford to ignore China for multiple reasons and also recalling Colombo’s ties with Beijing in the past.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

In fact, his policy of equidistance means that he will do justice with China as well though he has visited India first under pressure from the known hegemon.
Unsubstantiated rumors have it that the politically strong Rajpaksha brothers prefer China over India for reasons unknown to many political observers but known to those who have specialized on SA politics.
It could be the compulsion of Sri Lanka to counter the Indian hegemony and thus they need Chinese help and have every valid reasons to inch closer to China.
Qureshi has met his Sri Lankan counterpart Dinesh Gunawardena this Monday in Colombo.
This has then set the tone for the visit of President Gotabaya to Pakistan to be followed by China or vice versa.
Let’s hope that China’s foreign Minister Wang Yi lands in Colombo much the same way the Indian minister landed there close on the heels of the declaration of the Sri Lankan election results.
Minister Wang’s Colombo trip as and when it materializes would send appropriate signals to the places where it should approach.
Needless to say, Indian minister Shankar’s visit to Colombo gets neutralized by the visit of the Pakistani foreign Minister Qureshi who is currently in Sri Lanka for a two day visit.
FM Qureshi’s talks with the Sri Lanka counterpart Dinesh Gunawardena is expected to keep the South Asian politics rolling in a better direction as both favor the revival of the India killed SAARC-the regional organization.
President Gotabaya has already made it clear that he will do all he can in order to revive the SAARC body.
With Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and now Sri Lanka ready for the revival of the dead SAARC, India now can do little to object to the majority of the voice from the regional countries that favor the revitalization of the regional body.
If Nepal is the current Chair then it is the turn of Pakistan to hold the stalled Summit of the SAARC. Pakistan must step up its activities in this regards. He is most welcome in Nepal.
To sum up, Sri Lanka and Pakistan being the two powerful countries of the South Asian region have no other option than to increase their “bilateral understanding” in order to keep not only the region safe but also to counter the Indian highhandedness which has terrified the smaller nations that unfortunately share their borders with the goliath.
This they can do through SAARC and other international organizations for the betterment of the South Asian region.
To sum up, the foreign ministers of Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka should travel in the region and lobby for the revival of the SAARC body and enhancing bilateral ties.
This will send the needed political signals where it is needed most.
Thus Pakistan’s foreign Minister Qureshi’s current trip to Colombo has significant political connotations of sort. Its meaning will have greater meaning when the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi visits Sri Lanka and adds to the strength of the Pak-Sri Lanka ties.
FM Qureshi in Colombo talked on Kashmir with the Sri Lankan media. He also briefed the media on regional developments.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said Pakistan and Sri Lanka enjoy longstanding and strong bilateral relations.
Issues confronting South Asia in the recent months were discussed when Qureshi met his counterpart in Colombo on Monday.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“FM Qureshi also briefed his Sri Lankan counterpart on the dire situation and human rights crisis” in Jammu and Kashmir”, news sources said.
FM Qureshi on behalf of Pakistan extended invitation to the Sri Lankan President and also to the Prime Minister.
The Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the Colombo page reported December 2, sought Pakistan’s assistance to boost bilateral trade and eradicate the drug menace plaguing his country when met Pakistan’s Foreign Affairs Minister Shad Mahmood Qureshi on Monday in Colombo.
“Drug trafficking and addiction is a grave evil that my country is confronted with. We wish to seek Pakistan’s assistance to eradicate this menace,” the SL President said.
An expanded Colombo-Islamabad friendship definitely will act like a political deterrent in South Asia, the regional observers hope.
Will these three countries work in this direction? They have to if South Asia is to be kept safe from the malevolent design of the Indian establishment.
China knows it better.
To sum up, the two south Asian neighbors and members of the SAARC body exchanged views on the entire gamut of bilateral relations and matters pertaining to regional and international issues which is a good development for the region.
In addition, the Pak FM Qureshi while meeting Dinesh Gunwerdene said that the two countries having held longstanding trade ties need to reach a higher level of economic cooperation, which at present has not been fully optimized and there is much potential for economic linkages to be strengthened. He highlighted that Sri Lanka is presently not fully utilizing its credit line of USD 200 million with Pakistan and invited Sri Lanka to make use of the opportunity, especially in the animal husbandry area, which would be beneficial for the country.
Minister Gunawardena lauded his appreciation for Pakistan’s partnership in multifaceted cooperation including the steadfast support for the country’s development process.
The Minister stated that this visit is the first to be made of a Foreign Minister to Sri Lanka following the formation of the Cabinet, after the election of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
Minister Gunawardena informed his counterpart that Sri Lanka was committed to continuing the bilateral partnership in all possible areas of cooperation and looked forward to engaging in the fields of tourism and higher education, in addition to the growing bilateral economic partnership.
A great disaster was averted in that the previous Sri Lankan PM Wickremesinghe was so close to India that his attitude towards Pakistan remained damn cold.
Had Sajith Premadasa won the election, it would have been a disaster for Pakistan,” a South Asian diplomatic source said as claimed by the Economic Times dated November 19/19.
The Economic Times further writes that as a young army officer in the early 1970s, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was sent to Pakistan for an officers’ training course at a time when Sri Lanka maintained strong relations with Pakistan.
Later, during the war with the LTTE, when he was the defence secretary under his brother Mahinda’s presidency, Pakistan military supported the Sri Lankan army.
To conclude, it may be recalled that during the 1971 unrest that led to the creation of Bangladesh, after India withdrew landing and overflight rights to Pakistan, Sri Lanka granted refueling facilities to Pakistan International Airlines. This very much speaks of the close ties of the two South Asian nations.
That the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has not wasted time become evident in that he has already met with Wu Jianghao, the Special Representative of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China and Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
“I was pleased to meet with the Special Representative of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China and Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Mr Wu Jianghao and had cordial discussions on China-LKA relations,” the Sri Lankan President tweeted.
The ground reality is that Sri Lanka’s deep ties with China in recent years is, arguably, a consequence of how the Tamil question played out between Colombo and Delhi.
Successive coalition governments in Delhi from 1989 to 2014, which were dependent on the support of the Tamil parties, struggled to balance the pulls and pressures from Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, and Colombo.
Needless to say, Delhi fell between the two stools. Its intervention deeply angered the majority Sinhala community. And the sense of threat from India nudged Sri Lanka to turn to China and Pakistan to balance against its northern neighbor, writes veteran Indian journalist C Raja Mohan in his fresh article December 1/19.
And in fact it was Delhi’s intervention on issues related with the Tamils that Colombo had to make a drift towards Beijing, claim Nepali observers.
This meet with the high Chinese functionary has meaning underneath.
Lastly but importantly, it is no coincidence that President Gotabaya’s inauguration ceremony occurred at an ancient temple built by Sinhalese King Dutugemenu—who is best known for defeating an invading Tamil king from the Chola kingdom.
Has this some meaning underneath? Keep on guessing.
It is time when Delhi will for sure press Colombo to inch closer to it. However, how to balance the ties between a hegemon and a partner in development, China, should be at best be decided by President Gotabaya and his team of seasoned leaders.
Yet for the time being China-Pakistan-Sri Lanka must enhance their ties which could be the desired political deterrent to the India’s regional hegemony in South Asia. What Colombo decides should be final though. Question is: has Colombo the political stamina in keeping Delhi at a comfortable distance sans Beijing or for that matter Pakistan’s help?

String of Pearls: 
For the Road However, the Sri Lankan president’s comments after his meeting with Modi have raised concerns about how the new regime will handle the question of the country’s Tamil minority. Rajapaksa made it clear in an interview to the Hindu that devolving political rights to the Tamil-dominated areas will not be his priority. Rather, he will focus on the regions’ economic development, reports the Scroll.in December 5, 2019.  This hints that Delhi awaits a set back from Colombo. And whether the much publicized String of pearls already in existence?  Or it is in the making? That’s all.  ",/international,"Thu, 05 Dec 2019 17:52:34 +0000"
32,http://telegraphnepal.com/imran-khans-stature-heightens-as-narendra-modi-dwarfs/,"N.P. Upadhyaya Kathmandu: Frustrations of the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan are real.
It is simply because none of the world leaders, save a few, with whom he has talked so far on the plight of the Kashmiri people have assured PM Khan of their total commitment and made any criticisms against the Indian highhandedness that it is over the annexation of the Kashmir since August 5/19.
It is the Turkish President Erdogen only who spoke in favor of Kashmir population while making his speech at the UN general assembly session the other day.
However, reports say that Indian foreign minister expressed his serious reservations on President Erdogen’s Kashmir pronouncement in his UN Speech to which the president retorted by saying that should Turkey seek permissions from India to talk on Kashmir?
Rest of the Muslim leaders who have converged in the US to attend the ongoing UN General Assembly session so far though have ignored the Pakistani plea thoroughly but concurrently “sympathized” in private with the plight of the imprisoned eight million Muslim population since 53 days in Kashmir.
This has apparently no political significance.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“Commercial-business” relations have outweighed the humanitarian values” so says the puzzled Prime Minister Mr. Khan.
Says PM Khan that “I have come to New York especially for Kashmir. Everything else is secondary. The World doesn’t realize that we are heading for a big disaster”.
Is he referring to the triggering of the nuclear button if pushed to the wall by India?
This he said while talking to the Editorial board members of the Wall Street Journal on September 25/19.
He further added while talking with the WSJ team that “India’s repressive and illegal actions in occupied Jammu and Kashmir will not only have repercussions for the region (implied South Asian region) but for the entire Muslim world”.
Though the PM may have felt somewhat cheated by the comity of nations in his bid to convince them of the “imminent disaster”, but yet in multiple ways he has conversely been able to draw the attention of the globe by talking with the International media of the sort of Wall Street Journal.
His message has reached far and wide.
The fact is that even the US President Donald Trump appears to be in a state of confusion in that the President remains convinced by what PM Khan has talked with him on Kashmir and thus he wants to mediate, however, the moment President Trump meets PM Modi-he thinks first of business more so in selling of sophisticated weapons to India and earn billions and billions of dollars. A guess works only though.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Even if it were the reality, the US President by this time has already understood how PM Modi had “used” him and his presence in the Houston crowd for gaining “domestic” popularity.
Come 27 September, PM Khan hopes that he will shake the UN general assembly by presenting the Kashmiri issue in a vibrant manner which will, he expects, compel the world leaders to think seriously on the present state of the ongoing Kashmiri plight.
Needless to say, the Muslim leader PM Khan has been somehow or the other been ignored by his own brethren Muslim community of nations.
If Iran came to support the Kashmiris, then the UAE and the Saudis and even Malaysia have completely ignored PM Khan’s plea.
Interestingly, the Malaysian President Dr. Mahathir talked of the Rohingya Muslims at the Colombia University Wednesday but preferred not to touch the Kashmir issue.
With all these setbacks in his bag, yet PM Khan is being taken as “my dear” to the Saudis, the Iranians, and the Americans in that all these three big countries have begun looking upon PM Khan with greater belief and faith hoping that he could be the one who can bring in peace in between these three countries. And Afghanistan is already on the table.
If Iran seeks Pakistan’s help in mending its differences with the USA then equally true is the desire of the Saudis who seek Khan’s good offices to mend its Himalayan differences with Iran which reportedly had attacked some of its oil refineries and caused big damage.
Some even say that the Iranian President landed in the USA only when convinced by PM Khan that things shall change if President Rouhani were to visit the UN general Assembly.
Or is it that the Iranian leader and the US high officials have already talked with each other?
And very interestingly, the USA very much needs the active but subtle diplomatic support in reaching out a peace deal with the Afghan-Talibans which was abruptly disrupted through a tweet released by President Trump a month ago.
Let’s see this in the light of the fact that the US special envoy on Afghanistan has already met with PM Khan in New York.
Thus the Pakistan Prime Minister is placed in such a position wherein he could through the exercise of his political/diplomatic acumen bring in peace in the entire region in and around Afghanistan, Iran, and the troubled Gulf countries.
He must bring in some cards from under his sleeves on such tricky occasions for its effective use.
Nepali observers see the most clever of it all is the Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE who outwardly praise and pose to bestow honor and respect for Imran Khan but in effect it is these countries who could have helped PM Khan but have not for some mysterious reasons. However, they must have their own problems, let’s presume it to have been so.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

In the issue of Jamal Khassogi killing, the Saudi Crown prince is being taken as the villain and this issue may also demand the very mediation of PM Khan at some point. The chances remain high.
But very freshly, we have learnt that Saudi Arabia has joined Pakistan on issue of Kashmiri plight and has joined few other countries who have asked India to rescind its actions revoking Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to which we shall talk later. Much the same way President Donald Trump may have already sought the active support of PM Khan, as stated earlier, to patch up his political differences with President Rouhani and vice versa.
Our own source claims that such a request from both the Iranian and the US side have already been made to PM Khan.
Khan is yet to respond but he will not ignore their requests most likely.
It is here that PM Khan has abundant space to push his main agenda as the bargain chip. But will he present himself in that way? Perhaps his modesty will not allow him to ignore those requests coming as those which will be from Presidents of Iran and USA.
But without the US mediation, the Kashmir issue shall remain hanging for long. Thus President Trump must jump in for timely mediation for the safety of the entire South Asian region which includes the Nepali plea.
Nepal perhaps is the nation in India’s neighborhood that apparently has joined or is likely to join the Indian-protectorate club.

In the meanwhile, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Wednesday expressed its “deep concern” over the worsening human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir with the Indian move to scrap its special status.
In a statement issued following a meeting of its Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir on the sidelines of the 74th session of UN General Assembly in New York, the Muslim body reaffirmed its
stance on the dispute over the Indian-administered region, Islamuddin Sajid for the Turkish news agency Anadola writes September 25/19.
The statement, adds Sajid, “expressed grave concern that India’s actions aim to change the identity and demographic composition of the occupied Jammu and Kashmir and to transform it from a Muslim-majority state into Hindu-majority territory.”
The OIC contact group also deplored on the lockdown of the Kashmiri people, round-the-clock curfew, detention of thousand people, including Kashmiri leaders.
The OIC said the settlement of the issue is “indispensable for durable peace and stability in South Asia and beyond”, informs Sajid for the Turki news agency.
Calling on India to rescind “its actions revoking article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir , Saudi Arabia joined Pakistan, Azerbaizan, Turkey, Niger to issue a statement on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), writes Suhasini haidar from New York for the Hindu Indian daily September 26, 2019.
While PM Modi was busy in praising President Trump at the Texas rally where he even told the Indian audience to vote for President Trump in the upcoming US elections, then around the same time, Imran Khan was pretty busy in discussing the Kashmir issue in details with the Secretary General of the Amnesty International Komi Naidoo, who called on Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday in New York.
PM Khan discussed with Naidoo the dire human rights and humanitarian situation in Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IOJ&K) since India’s illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019.
Prime Minister Imran Khan appreciated the lead role that Amnesty was playing in presenting the real state of human rights in the occupied territory and amplifying the voices of the Kashmiri population in a state of seven-week long lockdown. These efforts had helped raise international community’s awareness about the continuing suffering of the Kashmiri people.
Naidoo, on the other hand in response briefed PM Imran on “Amnesty’s advocacy work on Kashmir including #LetKashmirSpeak”, it has been reported.
Since the Kashmir annexation has negative impact on the overall South Asian security and political stability which is why this paper has made it a point to write against the Indian design in a repeated manner. In some way or the other, its impact could be felt in Nepal also if not the political aberrations corrected on time. Earlier the better.
By the way, the Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad September 25/19 said the NDTV that there is no democracy in Jammu and Kashmir and people are living in fear after the Centre scrapped the state’s special status on August 5.
Mr. Azad was talking to the media as he concluded his six-day tour of the state.
“There is disappointment in Kashmir and the despair is also prevalent among the people in Jammu province. Except 100 or 200 people of the ruling party (BJP), nobody is happy (over the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories),” the former chief minister told reporters before leaving for Delhi.
Mr. Azad, who had on Tuesday arrived in Jammu on the second-leg of his tour, had said the situation in Kashmir is “very bad”.

Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, has said he has been trying to raise the alarm at the United Nations this week, Friday September 27, 2019, about the danger of a nuclear war breaking out over Kashmir, so write Julian Borger in New York and Azhar Farooq from Sri Nagar dated September 26/19 for the Guardian.
The Pakistan PM was speaking to the media in New York September 25 where he said: ‘We are heading for a potential disaster of proportions that no one here realizes.’
Julian Borger and Azhar Farooq further write quoting PM Khan that “President Trump (has) asked me and also Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked me to speak to the Iranians, and we are trying our best that this should not develop into a conflict,” Khan said.
“The good thing about President Trump is that I feel he’s not a pro-war person, although I can see that there are others who are egging him on. But his instinct, quite rightly is not for war … I think that’s very admirable.”
Here is a flash: Yoshita Singh writes Sep 26 (PTI) from the UNGA sidelines that the Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Thursday boycotted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s opening statement at the meeting of the SAARC Council of Foreign Ministers, saying his country will not engage with India “until and unless” it lifts the “siege” in Kashmir.
The meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session here started in his absence.
Minister Shankar also boycotted Qureshi’s speech inside the SAARC meet.
Nepal as the current Chair of the SAARC regional body had convened the SAARC foreign ministers meet. The Pak FM appears to have only avoided Indian FM’s speech. Later he joined the Foreign Minister’s conference.
But this is just one step forward yet.
However, yet all is not lost for PM Imran Khan on Kashmir-the world class cricketer turned political personality who is leading Pakistan.
The political dividends appear to have been in the pipeline.
Many Nepali observers agree that he is a political and nuclear deterrent for the entire South Asian region. A strong Pakistan is what the smaller neighbors of fascist India needs very much for their own safety.
A time soon shall come when the Indo-pendent countries in South Asia shall weep when India will begin coercing them all under the orders of Ajit Doval and Shankar combine.
Reports have it that these two Doval-Shankar Indian stalwarts who dominate the BJP politics leaders. Modi is just working under their whims, it is widely believed.
And that PM Khan is a global player has best been recognized by a British online newspaper The Independent which says after a year of Imran Khan in power as Prime Minister, Pakistan is finally stepping into its role as a world player.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“The message to world leaders is loud and clear: In a dramatic shift from the past, Pakistan is no longer a pawn, a joke, a bystander on the world stage. It is active, engaged, relevant and responsible. This is a dramatic shift from the past, one which may garner greater recognition retrospectively,” adds the British online newspaper Independent in its article published on September 25/19, Wednesday.
On the international stage, Khan’s leadership style is a departure from his predecessors.
Recognition prior to politics, coupled with the promise of “incorruptibility”, signal his diplomatic stature. Incidents such as Pulwama, followed by the Kashmir crisis, put Khan’s diplomatic headship to instant test and both times, he scored, the article said.
The gist:Several requests for him to serve as an honest broker, as we have registered in earlier paragraphs, to mediate between the US-Afghanistan and US-Iran evidences the same confidence. Pakistan has surfaced as a responsible global player; a harbinger of peace with its narrative ubiquitously conveyed, the British online portal the Independent daringly writes.
If so then South Asian region shall ultimately benefit. The deterrence for India is already there now.
In the meantime, the British opposition Labour Party at its annual conference in Brighton passed a resolution seeking intervention by the international community in Jammu and Kashmir.
The resolution asked for the UN led-referendum to resolve the decades old Kashmir dispute.
The resolution submitted by Blackburn, Dudley North, Keighley, Stockport and Wakefield constituency Labour parties condemns the recent actions of the Indian government in the territory, international media sources have confirmed.
Imran Khan is thus becoming a global player? Conversely is PM Modi now a dwarf political personality in South Asia?  That’s all.",/international,"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 23:07:57 +0000"
33,http://telegraphnepal.com/us-prez-trump-must-mediate-on-kashmir-to-keep-south-asia-safe/,"N. P. Upadhyaya, Kathmandu: After the US heavy weight Bernie Sanders made some remarks that deplored the Indian aggression on Kashmir, a few more but key US Senators and Congressmen have freshly joined the chorus of Bernie Sanders and urged President Donald Trump to play a constructive role in helping resolve Kashmir and other underlying disputes between Pakistan and India.
In fact these US senators who have a say in the US national politics prefer President Donald Trump to intervene instantly and act as a reliable mediator on the Indian annexation of Kashmir as per his own announcement made July 22/2019 while meeting the Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan at the White House and that too in the presence of international media.
Media agencies have said that through a letter these US political luminaries have appealed their President September 12, to use his good offices and get released the people detained in Kashmir after Aug 5-the day India annexed the occupied valley.
Those who have jointly sent the letter to the US President are learnt to be Senators Chris Van Hollen, Todd Young, Ben Cardin and Lindsay Graham who have also expressed concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in Kashmir and urged him to use his influence on Pakistan and India to come to terms and resolve the Kashmir issue to the satisfaction of the Kashmiri people.
Interestingly, the senators have also noted that on Aug 5, the Indian government “unilaterally revoked Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which afforded autonomy to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.”
The use of the word unilateral here is meaningful which explains so many things unspoken.
In a fresh development, some Kashmiri citizens currently in the US have filed a lawsuit in the United States against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for carrying out extrajudicial killings and other crimes in occupied Kashmir.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The lawsuit, as per the available media reports, was filed just days before Modi is scheduled to speak at a major rally called “Howdy, Modi!” in Houston, Texas, where he is expected to be joined by US President Trump.
The lawsuit, according to the Houston Chronicle, was filed by a pair of unnamed US-based Kashmiris.
The newspaper has identified the attorney as Gurpatwant Singh Pannu of Kashmir Khalistan Referendum Front.
Pannu is widely known as the legal head for ‘Sikhs for Justice’ (SFJ), which is a banned outfit in India.
Besides Modi, the Wire reports dated 20, 2019, the filed lawsuit also names home minister Amit Shah and the general officer commanding of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps, Lieutenant Kanwal Jeet Singh Dhillon. They have been accused of “extrajudicial killing” and “wrongful death, battery, emotional distress, crimes against humanity”.
Interesting is the fact that the Indian Prime Minister Modi has been recognized “as an undesirable character till fairly recently”.
After the Gujarat massacres in 2002, under his watch as Chief Minister, many countries of the world including the United States had placed a visa ban on Modi.
Countries like the UK and many EU countries had done the same, however, it is these countries now who embrace the “massacre man” as and when they happen to meet this South Asian Hitler that he is taken by the South Asian population.
India’s satellite countries including Nepal have termed the August 5 aggression of Kashmir as “internal” matter of India to which it definitely is not.
In a dramatic development, quite in contrast with the Persian Gulf’s Arab countries, for example, the Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, which have either supported India’s abrogation of Article 370 or have had a subdued response on Kashmir, Iran has taken a position against New Delhi. Given the Islamic Republic’s tendency to balance positive relations with both India and Pakistan, its decision to oppose India in this instance is notable. It raises questions as to whether, and how, the elimination of Kashmiri autonomy could impact Iranian-Indian relations, writes Giorgio Cafiero September 20.
Iran’s express support to the Kashmiri issue is somewhat puzzling in view of the fact that the “intimate” friends of Pakistan such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE and some other countries in the gulf region have more or less just lured Pakistan.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

But yet these countries helped Pakistan at a time when PM Khan needed “money” to help save the country, if one were to recall.
To recall, On August 21, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei took to social media to call on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to reverse its actions in Kashmir.
He said, “We have good relations with India, but we expect the Indian government to adopt a just policy towards the noble people of Kashmir and prevent the oppression & bullying of Muslims in this region”, adds by Giorgio Cafiero.
However, Talking to Al Jazeera TV networks September 14, 2019, the Pakistani Prime Minister much ahead of heading to the US via Saudi Arabia to take part in the UN General Assembly spoke his mind if in case of a sad event unfortunately that brings the two nuclear states, India and Pakistan, close to a conventional war then what he or his country in the given condition would do?
“If Pakistan is forced to embrace a conventional war and if a country is stuck between the choices: either you surrender or you fight ’till death for your freedom, I know my countrymen will fight to death for their freedom. So when a nuclear-armed country fights to the end, to the death, it has consequences.”
This makes it clear that if pushed to the wall, Pakistan would have no choice other than to think of the nuclear option and what would this mean is any body’s guess, so signaled the Cricketer turned Prime Minister Imran Khan.
In order to avert the disastrous consequences that may result from the choice of the Nuclear option the PM says, “So that’s why we have approached the United Nations, we are approaching every international forum, that they must act right now because this is a potential disaster that would go way beyond the Indian subcontinent.”
PM Khan however, gave a subtle hint to the Al Jazeera TV that the imminent war in between India and Pakistan could very much be averted if countries engaged now in the verbal war could see sense and understand the gravity of the emerging dangerous situation’ and act accordingly.
Khan says, “I’m glad they say I’m a prime minister of U-turns. Only an idiot doesn’t do any U-turns,” Khan tells Al Jazeera. “Only a moron, when he’s on a course and he comes across a brick wall, only that stupid idiot keeps banging his head against a brick wall. An intelligent person immediately revises his strategy and goes around it.”
This means that if PM Modi changes his stubbornness and arrogance and come to terms with what has already been specifically told and dictated by several UN resolutions in the past then the Kashmir issue could be settled. He perhaps hints at the possibility of being “flexible” if the Indian side soften its hardened stance.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

To recall, very recently Pakistan went to Geneva and approached the UN Human Rights body and secured the sympathy of some forty plus countries who through a joint statement shared the concern expressed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet regarding the impact of recent actions of the Narendra Modi government on the human rights of people of occupied Kashmir.
Now this issue shall very much reverberate inside the Hall of the UN General Assembly within two weeks or so.
India and Pakistan may collide at the UN general assembly lobby this September end.
Nepal may bring both the rival nations, India and Pakistan, in the same table on the sidelines of the UNGA, as the SAARC Chair, it is talked. Hope wisdom prevails on both the rival countries.
At a different plane, the Amnesty International which remained so far tight lipped on the Kashmir upon being questioned by several international bodies has, better late than never, launched a petition on its website urging people to raise their voice against the government-imposed communications blackout in India-occupied Kashmir that has been in place for over a month.
It is perhaps approaching 50th dark day in Kashmir after the August 5 illegal annexation.
The AI says, September 15, 2019, in part, that nearly 8 million people have been living through a communication shutdown since August 5,” the human rights organization stated on its website.
AI statement has come only after several media organizations alleged the Amnesty as to have been clearly taking the sides of the Indian establishment on Kashmir aggression.
While writing this story, the Octogenarian Chief Minister (former) of Kashmir, Farooq Abdullah, has been arrested under a draconian law called the Public Safety Act (PSA).
He has been detained inside his house which equals now to a jail.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

In the meanwhile, the Indian top court said on Monday, September 16/19 that the federal government should restore normal life in Kashmir as soon as possible, as a partial shutdown of the disputed region entered its 42nd day, so writes Suchitra Mohanty and Alasdair Pal for the Reuters, Delhi.
“We direct Jammu and Kashmir to make the very best endeavor to make sure normal life returns,” India’s Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said on Monday, after a panel of three judges heard several petitions relating to Kashmir, which is also claimed by Pakistan, adds Suchitra
Even after the Indian Court orders, situation in Kashmir remains the same. Delhi appears to have ignored the SC verdict.
It would not be out of place if we reproduce here to what the first Prime Minister of the Republic of India J.L. Nehru had stated as back as in the Indian Parliament on August 7, 1952.
Nehru had said then, according to senior analyst A.G Noorani that “It is an international problem. It would be an international problem anyhow if it concerned any other nation besides India and it does. It became further an international problem because a large number of other countries also took interest and gave advice…. We do not want to win people against their will and with the help of armed force, and if the people of Jammu and Kashmir State so wish it, to Part Company from us, they can go their way and we shall go our way. We want no forced marriages, no forced unions like this…( A. G. Noorani, The Wire).
Writes A. J Noorani in his fresh article “Is Kashmir a Domestic or International Issue? Published in the Wire dated September 15/19 in the Opinion column.
In fact, analyst Noorani recollects to what PM Nehru had stated then.
Noorani remembers what Nehru had stated on July 8, 1949, wherein he (read the Indian PM Nehru) had clearly stated that “Kashmir is a world question”.
Says Noorani, “he was all for mediation and had said on November 12, 1949, at a press conference in London that “India continues to suggest that there should be mediation and that this mediation should be under the auspices of the United Nations partly because we want to increase the prestige of the United Nations.”
Two questions arise claims A.J Noorani in the same article that “When did India resile from this stand, and why? Has the world deferred to this volte-face? The second is easily answered. At the recent G7 Summit at Biarritz, France, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ruled out mediation but not the fact that Kashmir is a dispute between India and Pakistan to be resolved bilaterally.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

This was the stand he took, writes A. G Noorani, in talks with US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron.
Modi had said that “All the issues between India and Pakistan are bilateral in nature.”
The existence of the issues is surely an affirmation implicitly of the issue–Kashmir.
President Trump said on August 25 that Modi and he had discussed Kashmir “at great length”. Clearly, Kashmir is no internal matter is this. So sums up A. G Noorani his thought provoking article in the Wire.
Abdul Ghafoor Abdul Majeed Noorani, known popularly as A. G. Noorani, is an Indian lawyer, constitutional expert and political commentator.
He has practiced as an advocate in the Supreme Court of India and in the Bombay High Court. (Source Wikipedia).
Good news for the South Asian region: PM Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan will address the UNGA the same day, on September 27.
Imran Khan is likely to speak within minutes of Narendra Modi’s speech September 27/19. Khan hopes that China remains a reliable partner even at the UNGA to get the world’s ear on Kashmir.
Nepali observers are confident that for the resolution of the Kashmir issue in between India and Pakistan, the US President Trump must jump in for mediation in between the two rival nations at the earliest if he wants to avert the threat of war that looms over South Asia.
The US President must mediate on Kashmir-dispute or else the SA region is doomed. President Trump must save South Asia from the new fascist leader in India-PM Modi. That’s all.",/international,"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 19:29:18 +0000"
34,http://telegraphnepal.com/is-kashmir-the-largest-prison-in-world/,"N.P. Upadhyaya; Kathmandu: China’s State Counselor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi made a short trip to Pakistan the previous week.
Minister Wang’s trip to Pakistan has come close on the heels of the Indian annexation of Kashmir last month August 5 and thus this meet in between the foreign ministers of Pakistan and China must have some intrinsic meaning.
This trip assumes more significance in that it was primarily the Chinese initiative that the Kashmir issue as demanded by Pakistan got its easy entry into the United Nations Security Council debate, August 16, 2019.
Apart from the China-Pakistan bilateral dialogue that may have brought the two “iron brothers” more closer to each other, then the fresh visit of the Chinese Minister Wang Yi also brought the neighboring Afghanistan for a tri lateral dialogue which as reports claim, ended to the satisfaction of the three participating nations: China, Pakistan and Afghanistan.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

During the bilateral meet of Pakistan and China held on September 7 made it clear that the “unilateral” actions by India in Kashmir would further “complicate” the situation.
FM Qureshi and Wang held delegation-level talks after the Chinese foreign minister arrived in Islamabad to participate in the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue.
The Chinese foreign minister Wang has reaffirmed China’s support and reiterated opposition to any unilateral action as well as the measures that could further complicate the situation, media sources have said.
This should mean that China shall back Pakistan in any eventuality that takes shape in the region and beyond including obviously Afghanistan.
All put together, the upcoming UN general assembly in New York this month, two weeks from now, will be exhilarating in that the issue of “Forced Kashmir annexation” by India will in all likelihood draw the attention of the civilized countries of the world when they meet later this month at the UNGA in New York.
An almost satisfied Afghanistan with this tri lateral dialogue hosted by Islamabad, perhaps willingly allowed China to help establish peace and stability not only in the troubled country, Afghanistan but also in the entire region including Central Asia.
Nepal too would benefit in some way or the other.
Lauding the timely happening of the tri lateral conference, the ministers of China, Pakistan and Afghanistan in a joint statement issued dated August 8, 2019, have said that “China, Pakistan and Afghanistan reiterate their support for a politically negotiated settlement of the long-standing conflict in Afghanistan”.
A joint statement which had been issued after the conclusion of the third round of China-Afghanistan-Pakistan foreign ministers’ dialogue held on Saturday said the three sides (China, Pakistan and Afghanistan) had been closely following recent developments in the region and taken note of the talks between the U.S. and Taliban, so wrote the Yeni Safak-World new agency.
The joint statement further adds that the trilateral meet “Hope(s) the intra-Afghan negotiations including direct negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban begin soon and lead to full cessation of violence bringing lasting peace for the people of Afghanistan.

Notably, China has benefitted from this three country meet in that the joint statement talks of advancing connectivity under the China’s BRI initiative which in part says that, “The three sides reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening their relations, exploring new ways of deepening cooperation, including advancing connectivity under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan (RECCA) and other regional economic initiatives”, the joint statement further added.
Mind it that the Belt and Road Initiative is a Chinese mega project that is associated with the very prestige of President Xi Xinping.
This meet in many more ways than one has also helped Pakistan to convince Afghanistan that Pakistan favors the prevalence of complete peace and stability in Afghanistan and that peace in Afghanistan has a direct impact on the peace and stability in Pakistan and the entire region including obviously Afghanistan.
Pakistan and Afghanistan must understand that “neighbors” can’t be changed.
If Nepal can survive with the Fascist India then why Pakistan and Afghanistan can’t live together in peace if both so desire?
In sum, the Chinese, Pakistani and Afghani foreign ministers have stressed on the need for and inclusive, Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process to bring in peace and stability in Afghanistan for all time to come.
This means that China has entered into this region which in effect shall link China with yet another vast expanse of Central Asian landmass.
For the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, CPEC, peace in Afghanistan is more than necessary for China to enter into the Central Asian region through Gwadar port city in Pakistan.
The benefits for Pakistan are very much attached with the prevalence of peace in Afghanistan. The completion of the China assisted and initiated CPEC projects perhaps shall bring in positive dividends to Pakistan in a surprising way.

Most importantly, the CPEC will by this time already have generated employment opportunities for the unemployed youths of Pakistan.
The generation of employment opportunities in Pakistan may bring down the youths from flying to Gulf countries. Generation of few thousands of Mega Watts of electrical energy is what shall immediately benefit the friendly country.
A lesson must “to be learnt” by the thug communist- Nepal rulers from China-Pakistan friendship.
If China can help Pakistan then why not Nepal? But why China help a Nepal that has been run by the Indian agency-the RAW? Foreign Minister Wang Yi saw for himself as to how the “Nepali bureaucrats” work for the neighboring country’s core interests.
Minister Wang had come to Kathmandu right from Islamabad after attending the trilateral meet.
With China’s entrance in this strategic region, the Indian establishment has been left high and dry and if copied President Trump’s quote then India will be limited to building “Libraries” in Afghanistan.
The next round of this trilateral meet shall be held in Beijing, claim media sources.
In the meantime, almost in a surprising move President Donald Trump has called off separate secret meetings planned with the Taliban and Afghanistan’s president at Camp David.
Citing a Taliban-claimed deadly attack in Kabul some ten days ago, Trump also said he was cancelling the talks between the US and the Taliban that started almost a year ago in Qatar in an effort to end the 18-year war in Afghanistan.
In a statement on Sunday, the Afghan government praised the “sincere efforts of its allies” and expressed its commitment to work with the US “to bring lasting peace”, writes Shireena Qazi September 8, 2019, for the Al Jazeera.
While the US appears to have backed out from the talks but yet a Taliban representative in Doha, who is part of the team that had been negotiating with US officials since October last year, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the group has called a meeting to discuss its next move, without reacting further to Trump’s move.
President Ghani too favors resumption of the failed talks. He has already made the offer the previous week.
With the US declining talks with Taliban and the latter still expressing its desire to continue with the peace talks with the US, the politics appears to have become bit complicated.
It is here that both the US and the Talibans need the active support and the mediatory role of the Pakistani establishment in resuming the failed talks once again and bring in tranquility in the region and make the US forces’ exit a normal one.
Media reports being collected from the US reveal that Pakistan has urged the United States and Afghan Taliban to re-engage as there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan.
No wonder then Pakistan has already taken an initiative in that the commander of the United States Central Command (US Centcom), General Kenneth F McKenzie Jr, this Monday called on Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa here at the Pakistan Army’s headquarters.
This event is significant in that this meet has taken place after US has canceled the talks with the Afghan-Talibans.
After the abrupt cancellation of the talks, the Pak Foreign Ministry said on Sunday, “we have learnt about the cancellation of President Trump’s meeting with the Taliban and Afghan Government representatives in Camp David”, writes Islamuddin Sajid on September 8, 2019, for the Asia/Pacific news agency, a Turkish news agency most likely.
The Turkish news agency states further that Pakistani foreign ministry believes that there is no military solution to conflict in Afghanistan.
In the meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet Jeria on Monday September 9 said she is “deeply concerned about the impact of the Indian government’s recent actions in Jammu and Kashmir, and urged the Narendra Modi government to ease the lockdown”.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Jeria made these remarks in her opening statements at the 42nd session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. “I have appealed particularly to India to ease the current lockdowns or curfews; to ensure people’s access to basic services; and that all due process rights are respected for those who have been detained. It is important that the people of Kashmir are consulted and engaged in any decision-making processes that have an impact on their future.”
In the meanwhile, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Wednesday, September 11, said that Pakistan had achieved a biggest success at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) as over 58 plus countries supported Pakistan’s stance on Indian Occupied Kashmir.
Minister Qureshi was in Geneva to let the civilized countries of the world as to what had been the state of Kashmir and its population for over a month or so.
Ms. Thakur on behalf of India too responded and, as was expected, denied the Pakistani accusation and said that “all was well” in Kashmir.
A Joint Statement delivered at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva by Pakistan on behalf of over 58 countries from across various regions says it shares the concern expressed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet regarding the impact of recent actions of the Narendra Modi government on the human rights of people of occupied Kashmir.
The statement added that the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) , UN Special Procedures in their joint press release of 22 August 2019, civil society organizations and international media have repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the unprecedented restrictions and on the continuous curfew imposed since August 5, curbing of fundamental freedoms, communications blackout and reports of wide spread torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, molestation of women, and enforced disappearances.
For the Road: The USA Today magazine dated September 7 in its opinion column writes that “If the world doesn’t intervene to stop the brutality in Kashmir, all will suffer”.
Writes Professor Riffat Hassan for the USA today that “a million Indian soldiers have made Kashmir, the only Muslim –majority state under Indian control, the largest prison in the world”. Madame Riffat Hassan is an internationally acclaimed Islamic scholar and a social activist. That’s all.",/international,"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:19:24 +0000"
35,http://telegraphnepal.com/indian-action-on-kashmir-unacceptable-senator-bernie-sanders/,"N.P. Upadhyaya Kathmandu: The US heavy weight has better late than never spoken on “Kashmir occupation” carried out by the Indian Union on August 5, 2019.
After his comments made on India’s Kashmir aggression last month perhaps nothing remains to be spoken by other world leaders on Kashmir.

He weighs high even if several world leaders speak collectively against his remarks and thus he has authentically stamped that Kashmir has at best been occupied by the Indian establishment and that India should act in a way that the UN resolutions have already dictated on Kashmir.
It was an occupation of Kashmir, so implied the US towering personality.
In doing so, he perhaps ensured the entire American-Pakistani votes for himself in the upcoming US Presidential elections.
Bernie Sanders of the US Democratic Party while addressing the audience at an event hosted by the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) that he was “deeply concerned” about the situation in Kashmir and has also asked his own US government to “speak out boldly” in support of a UN-backed peaceful resolution to resolve the lingering issue.
His thundering speech may have jolted the entire US Administration. President Trump too prefers a solution to the issue however, his political inclination for a variety of reasons impede his ways that doesn’t all him to press India hard.
It is perhaps the Indo-Pacific Card.
Making a fiery speech at the annual convention of the Islamic Society of North America in Houston on last Saturday, the 77-year-old leader also sought an immediate end to communications blockade in Kashmir.
The reverberations of Bernie’s speech must have approached Delhi-the capital of the Hindu-fascist regime.
Kashmiri people since 30 days plus have been imprisoned by the Central Government of India. The brutality appears to have no end in sight.
The septuagenarian US leader Bernie says, “India’s action is unacceptable,” while addressing one of the largest Muslim gatherings in the country in decades.
“I am deeply concerned about the situation in Kashmir and thus the Indian action in Kashmir is unacceptable,” Bernie added.
Bernie thus has hit the nail right on the head of the Indian PM Modi.
Bernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, said the crackdown on dissent in Kashmir “in the name of security” impedes the access to medical care. Unfortunately, Bernie Sanders has not been told of the Nepal’s misery brought about by the Communist thugs for the common people of Nepal.
Is Bernie listening? For God sake please listen to the killing of democratic system in Nepal by the Communists.
To Pakistan’s utter surprise, Bernie Sanders is a Jew who has joggled the entire US management by taking the just side of the “majority” Kashmiri people (the Muslims who apparently do not wish to mingle with the Jews).
In Nepal however, this scribe once brought the Ambassadors of Pakistan and Israel together and they not only shook their hands but since then became good friends.
(The names of the Ambassadors have been withheld for some exclusive reasons).
Pakistani leadership should now think on how to initiate diplomatic ties with Israel.
I recall, how the Indians in the early seventies used to hate the Israelis in Kathmandu. And now perhaps it is the Indian government which is perhaps most close to the Israeli state.
Modi hugs Benjanim Netan Yahu as and when they meet each other either in Delhi or in Jerusalem.
India by inching closer to Israel has enhanced its military strength in various sectors.
Initiation of diplomatic ties with Israel will be a good proposition for Pakistan despite the idea may be taken as a cultural-religio shock to the majority Muslims inside Pakistan. The Oxford graduate PM Khan perhaps will take up the issue for the benefit of his nation though he may counter some problems in the initial days.
The rest depends on the Pakistani leadership led by Imran Khan. But yet as far as I recall, PM Benazir Bhutto have had definitely tried “secretly” to land in Israel but in the meantime some political glitch thwarted the entire secretly planned trip to Israel.
At least this was the rumor in Kathmandu then as far as this scribe recalls.
After Bernie Sanders criticism of India on Kashmir, Professor Larry Diamond at the Stanford University in one of his fresh articles touches upon Kashmir.
Let’s look what he says: “In the face of sometimes brutal and even deadly state repression, the courageous mobilization of ordinary citizens, standing up for their rights, should inspire all of those who live in established, liberal democracies. At the same time, the ill winds of strongman populism, intolerance of minorities, and readiness to eclipse constitutional norms—which have already eviscerated democracy in countries such as Hungary, Turkey, and Bangladesh—now cast a shadow over the future of democracy in the Philippines, Poland, and India, particularly with the recently reelected Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dismissal of the state government in Kashmir. (He missed referring Nepal).
Dr. Diamond says, “Without the support of the U.S. government, pro-democracy forces around the world will wither as authoritarianism gains ground.
His saying applies to Nepal’s case as well as the ruling communists have become like oppressor. The Nepali population instead of enjoying democracy are being ruled by authoritarian rulers. People may revolt any time.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

A quick look into the gist of Dr. Diamond’s article one can get that this veteran political scientist feels pained by the fresh Indian attack on Kashmir. He is not happy with the summary dismissal of the state government in Kashmir.
He says this in his article titled “America’s Silence Helps Autocrats Triumph” published in the SEPTEMBER 6, 2019, ISSUE OF THE FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE.
Coming back to Israel, Some Arabian countries too secretly have been trying to break the age old taboos and initiate ties with Israel, it has been learnt from high placed international commentators.
Prior to the Jew Bernie Sanders, it was Ms. Ilhan Omar, once again a US Democratic senator who had talked in favor of the Kashmir population who have been living in a hellish conditions since August 5 under the shadow of barbarism of the Indian military forces since last month. And now it is Dr. Larry Diamond who has spoken on Kashmir. Sympathy is increasing in favor of the Kashmiri “imprisoned” people.
The tragedy with Pakistan is that she has no “effective lobby” in Washington D. C. The absence of an effective Pakistan lobby in the USA is what has perhaps been the greatest failure of Pakistani diplomacy which has been hurting Pakistan in many more ways than one. The facts speak for themselves.
But yet, some British law makers have acknowledged that the Kashmir issue is an internationally recognized dispute and awaits the “implementation of the relevant UNSC resolutions.
They have also noted with concern the tragic situation of “human rights” as well as the blockade imposed by India which has led to a severe humanitarian, political and security crisis in the “occupied territory”. (Courtesy Twitter September 4, 2019).
The Pakistan PM Khan has some good news for the Indian Sikhs together with the entire Sikh community scattered all over the world who as pilgrims visit Kartarpur and Nankana Sahib, as well as other Sikh holy sites in different cities of Pakistan.
Addressing a Sikh conference in Lahore PM Khan has assured the Sikh community that his government will make all efforts to facilitate pilgrims who visit Kartarpur and Nankana Sahib, as well as other Sikh holy sites in different cities of Pakistan.
In all his modesty, PM Khan said that “This is not a favor, this was our duty”.
The prime minister expressed his concerns over the situation in occupied Kashmir, saying: “No one who has any humanity left (in them) can tolerate the current situation in Kashmir. We can never accept that you place eight million people under lockdown for several days and cut off all communication. I would have raised my voice even if they [Kashmiris] were [non-Muslims].”
At the end of his speech the PM said “he realized that Kartarpur and Nankana Sahib were as holy for Sikhs as Makkah and Madina were for Muslims, and promised to make access for Sikh pilgrims as easy as possible.
PM Khan’s positive gesture must have pleased the attending Sikh pilgrims who were listening to his speech in Lahore inside the convention hall.
International commentators now have valid reasons to believe that the Sikh community shall now work as “Peace Ambassadors” in between the two rival countries.
Khan’s Lahore speech too would have its own sort of impact on those Sikhs who have been championing for the cause of Khalistan. The Canadian Sikhs will celebrate for some exclusive reasons. It is expected to boost in its own way the slogan of Khalistan referendum-2020.
And PM Khan mentioned that a day may come soon when the Sikhs shall be the target of the BJP party. The RSS shall not spare the Sikhs, Khan hinted.
Look how PM Khan made the Sikhs to believe that the BJP threat was not only real but sure to hit the Sikhs sooner than later.
In the meanwhile the Pakistani Army last Thursday said it had successfully test-fired a nuclear-capable surface-to-surface ballistic missile called Ghaznavi.
The missile is capable of “delivering multiple types of warheads up to 290 km”, said armed forces spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor.
This came amid rising hostilities between Pakistan and India since New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status earlier this month.
India’s Chandrayan has already landed in the Moon, it has been learnt.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

PM Khan has recently talked with the French President and the Jordanian King close on the heels of the launch of the Ghaznavi ballistic missile.
Definitely, the launch of this missile must have added strength to its military might whose impact must have approached Delhi-the seat of RAW and the Hindu terror machinery.
Responding to PM Khan, the French President highlighted the significance of resolution getting sought through a nonviolent ground while he also lauded Pakistan’s continuous efforts of bringing about peace in Afghanistan.
Abu Arqam Naqash for the Reuters writes that a Kashmiri militant commander has said on Sunday that Pakistan should send troops to protect the people of India-controlled Kashmir if the United Nations does not send peacekeepers, after New Delhi revoked its autonomy last month.
Mr. Abu Arquam Naqash further adds that “It’s binding upon the armed forces of Pakistan, the first Islamic nuclear power, to enter into the India-occupied Kashmir to militarily help the people of the territory,” Syed Salahuddin- the militant commander- who heads an alliance of over a dozen groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, said reports Reuters dated September 1, 2019.
Along with the Indian atrocities the Kashmiri population have been made to suffer since one month or so, the news covering international media too have been telling their ordeals while noting down or for that matter taking related photographs of the security forces atrocities in India held Kashmir.
Media man Mr. Rifat Fareed for the Al Jazeera writes September 1, 2019, that
“As the crippling lockdown in Indian-administered Kashmir nears a month, journalists in the region complain of harassment by authorities, with many accusing security forces of deleting their camera footage and pressure to report “normalcy”.
“This is a unique situation, writes Rifat that none of us had seen anything like this in the past. Even in the worst of times in Kashmir, we were able to file our stories,” said Muzaffar Raina as he waits to access his email at a Media Facilitation Centre in the main city of Srinagar.
The India-Pakistan conflict will definitely have a negative impact on the US wish for an honorable and early exit from Afghanistan so writes Anwar Iqbal for the Dawn Daily.
“The developing situation in India-held Kashmir might negatively impact the Afghan peace process, warns a US think tank as a congressional subcommittee scheduled a hearing to review the situation in the valley.
Media man Anwar further writes that “Pakistan has been playing a significant role in the recent US-Afghan peace negotiations with the [Afghan] Taliban. The Kashmir issue may not only detract Pakistani resources and political will away from Afghanistan but potentially could also be used as leverage to persuade the United States to intervene with India,” the US think tank report adds.
The reason is very simple in that “The Afghan peace talks are in their final phase and the US and Taliban delegations are now holding their ninth meeting in Doha, Qatar, to finalize a deal. But reports from Doha indicate that Washington may fail to conclude a deal by Sept first week as it had been expected.
A fresh news from Kabul says that the U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has returned to Qatar for more, unscheduled talks with the Taliban.
His return comes just four days after Khalizad announced that his team had reached an agreement “in principle” with the Taliban aimed at ending the longest war ever to ensnare the U.S. military.
When he announced the draft agreement on last Monday, Khalilzad said his negotiations with the extremist group had concluded and that the deal lacked only approval from his bosses in the Trump administration, writes CBS this morning dated September 6, 2019.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The delay, if any per chance, will further enhance Pakistan’s role in persuading the Taliban to stay engaged with the US. But what if an annoyed Pakistan dilly-dallies the US requests?
Pakistan media believes that President took a U turn from what he had assured PM Khan on July 22 at the White House.
Naturally if Pakistan fails in managing an early and dignified US exit from Afghanistan as promised, the US shall perhaps conclude that it may have been so due to the Indian actions on Kashmir which deflected the attention of Pakistan towards Kashmiri people plight or else Pakistan would have acted according to its words given to the President of the USA.
Before we conclude, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United States Asad Majeed Khan said the international community “must do more” to pressure India to end its militarized curfew over Kashmir. Ambassador Majeed said this in Washington said claiming that India’s prime minister has turned a vast section of the disputed Muslim majority region into “practically a concentration camp.” He was talking to the reporters of the Washington Post in the recent days.
All in all, Bernie Sanders taking up the Kashmir issue and Pakistan’s own Ghaznavi ballistic missile strength have made its impact in its own way.
To conclude with Kashmir again: The military lockdown and communications blackout imposed by the Indian government following the revocation of the region’s autonomy last month has crippled life in the Muslim-majority Kashmir region, so writes Adnan Bhat for the Al Jazeera dated September 6, 2019.
Mr. Adnan adds, the unprecedented siege, which entered its second month on Thursday, has severely affected patients in need of urgent medical attention and better facilities.
That’s all.",/international,"Fri, 06 Sep 2019 19:23:21 +0000"
36,http://telegraphnepal.com/sian-brown-cloud/,"Professor Durga D. Poudel, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Louisiana, USA
I had an opportunity to attend the 23rd International Grassland Congress (IGC), November 20-24, 2015, in New Delhi, India, and experience massive air pollution in the city. I have heard about the terrible air pollution in New Delhi, but when visiting the city for about a week and directly experiencing air pollution 24-hours a day, I learned that it was something much different. There was thick haze everywhere and it was hard to read road signs even from a near distance. There were halos on the streetlights during the day. The sun behind the haze of the pollution was pale and weak in color. Living with this level of poor visibility under the blanket of brown haze and dim sunlight was very uncomfortable and suffocating. I talked to some of the participants of the IGC and learned that the diplomats are very much concerned about living in the city and the level of respiratory illnesses among city people is rising rapidly. Obviously, the causes of this pollution were vehicular and industrial emissions, thermal plants, biomass burning, and other particulate matters. While returning to the USA, it was an amazing feeling when I could see green fields, waterbodies, buildings, roads, and specks of white clouds while looking down from the plane several thousand feet above the ground as I landed in Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, USA.
In December of 2018, I visited Kathmandu with the main purpose of understanding and preparing logistics such as hotels, transportation, etc., for our Study Abroad Pilot program that my university, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette), USA, was considering to launch during the summer of 2019 in Nepal. UL Lafayette has been running its Study Abroad Program in Costa Rica, England, France, and Italy. As usual, the city of Kathmandu was under the havoc of the worst air pollution (The picture presented here, however, was taken in May, 2019). There was a very thick haze everywhere. I could see people everywhere with facial masks. I also had facial masks with me, which I had brought from USA, while travelling across the city. It is quite uncomfortable travelling with facial masks. The fear of air pollution and health impact is so high that you do not enjoy your life fully. There were high levels of dust pollution. The level of vehicular emissions of exhaust soot was beyond imagination. The whole city was under the blanket of thick haze 24-hours and the nights were unusually cold. Maybe within a week of my stay in Kathmandu, I got so tired of the thick haze over me that I started feeling suffocated. One day, one of my friends called me and asked, “DurgaJi, should we go somewhere in the afternoon and have a cup of coffee together?” I replied to him within a fraction of a second saying, “Please take me somewhere that I can see the blue sky and breathe easily”. He picked me up from my home in Chabahill and we drove to Shivapuri Resort at Shivapuri National Park, located on the northern hill of Kathmandu Valley. I cannot describe the feeling of finally being under the blue sky, being able to see far from the top of the hill, and the joy of breathing clean air!

I had been dreaming for whole life visiting China and understanding more about my neighboring country in the north. It just happened this year that the Shandong University in Qingdao, China, invited me to run a one-week International Environmental Science Summer Camp called “Asian Campus Summer School”. Even though I had a busy summer with 16 students from my university participating in the Nepal Field Experience Pilot Study Abroad Program, I accepted the invitation. I arrived in Beijing in the morning of August 10, 2019, and as I was in transit waiting for my flight to Qingdao, I became quite curious about the air pollution in Beijing. The haze outside was so heavy to the point where I could not determine if it was about to rain or if it was just the air pollution. I returned to Beijing from Qingdao on August 15 and took a taxi to the A.C. Embassy Hotel, located in Embassy Area in Beijing. It was a nice about 40-minute drive. The city of Beijing had a clear and blue sky, no signs of air pollution. I was so surprised to find that what I had read about the air pollution in Beijing was much different to what I was witnessing. The next morning, I went to visit the Great Wall of China. It was a perfect picture-taking day.  It appears that the typhoon that came last week helped to clear up the sky. There was a typhoon warning in the city of Qingdao when I arrived there on August 10th and I was forced to stay in the hotel all day on the 11th and 12th.  August 18 had a less clear sky than the earlier two days. The 19th of August was surprisingly a hazy day in Beijing.
The presence of thick haze over Delhi, Kathmandu and Beijing should be explained with reference to the “Asian Brown Cloud”, a phrase coined by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) in 2002 following an extensive research known as the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), which was a very intensive atmospheric research conducted in 1999 over the Indian Ocean. The findings revealed that there is a three-kilometer-thick man-made pollution, largely from October-November to March-April in the atmosphere over South Asia, East Asia (China), and South East Asia. The “Asian Brown Cloud” later described as the “Atmospheric Brown Cloud” is mainly due to the presence of anthropogenic aerosols such as soot (mainly black carbon) and dusts produced through industrial and vehicular emissions, thermal plans or burning biomass. Sulfates and nitrates are other aerosols found in the brown cloud. The three-kilometer-thick “Asian Brown Cloud” has very strong effect on solar radiation, monsoon, precipitation, visibility, agricultural productivity, forest productivity, public health, climate change impacts, and many ecosystem services. This thick layer of brown cloud has radiation effect in the upper atmosphere resulting in temperature rise of the upper layer causing glacier melting, while there is “dimming” effect on the earth surface with many impacts including a decrease on surface temperature, reduced evaporation and precipitation, decreased monsoon, reduced vegetation growth and increased winter chills. As noticed already, the “Asian Brown Cloud” is affecting heavily the ecological and environmental systems, infrastructure, and the public in the region.

Just looking at the incidence of natural disasters in Nepal in the past five years, there is no doubt that something abnormal and alarming is happening in this country’s weather and climatic conditions. The 2014 Western Nepal flood that occurred in the month of August displaced more than 20,000 people and destroyed many houses and infrastructures. The 2017 Terai Flood which also occurred in the month of August caused a total loss of more than Rs. 63 billion destroying 41,000 houses completely and damaging 151,000 houses partially and temporarily displacing 460,000 people. The 2019 July flood killed at least 117 individuals and injured 80 people, while 38 are still missing. Thirty-two districts were affected by this flood with the displacement of at least 16,520 households with approximately 80,000 people and damaged many infrastructure, food stocks, and crops. The districts of Siraha, Mahottari, and Rautahat were very heavily impacted. Twenty four hours rainfall recorded at Simara was 12.3 inches. Besides these three recent flood events, the 1993 landslides and debris flow took 1,259 lives and destroyed many bridges and dams with a total monetary loss of more than 47,194 million rupees in 44 districts of Nepal. Although not directly related to Global Climate Change, the 7.8 Richter scale Gorkha Earthquake that occurred on April 25, 2015 caused 8,790 deaths and 22,300 injuries and destroyed thousands of villages across the 23 districts of Nepal. Researchers have reported rising temperatures, emerging diseases and parasites, declining annual rainfall, invasive plants, and melting glaciers, while villagers are experiencing dry springs, decline in water flow in springs and rivers, patchy rain events, drought conditions, high winter temperatures, declining agricultural productivity, and highly variable and unpredictable weather conditions. These incidences of natural disasters and climatic conditions warrant expedited launching of strategies and measures for climate change adaptation without any delay.
Planet Earth system consists of four subsystems: lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere. While the lithosphere contains all the land on the surface of the earth, underneath the crust (surface), and the core of the earth, the hydrosphere contains all the solid, liquid, and gaseous water. The biosphere contains all the planet’s living things. The atmosphere contains all the air and earth systems with 78% N2, 21% O2 and 1% Other gases. The atmosphere extends from below 1 m earth surface to more than 10,000 km above the earth surface. About 96% of the 1% Other gases is Argon (a noble gas) and only 0.04% of the 1% Other gases include atmospherically active trace and heat trapping gases called the greenhouse gases. These greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), Nitrous oxide (N2O), fluorinated gases (hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, nitrogen trifluoride, etc.), nitrogen monoxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon disulfide. These greenhouse gases are emitted from various activities including burning of fossil fuels (coal, petrol and diesel, natural gas), biomass burning, landfill sites, livestock and agricultural production, and industrial activities. The long-lived greenhouse gases such as N2O and CH4 are transported to the stratosphere (20 Km – 50 Km above the sea level) where they play roles in O3 destruction resulting in the thinning of O3 layer. The stratospheric O3 layer is necessary for blocking much of the ultraviolet radiation entering into the earth surface and regulating Earth’s radiating balance. On the other hand, in troposphere ( earth surface to 20 Km above sea level) short-lived greenhouse gases such as CO, NO2, NO react with CH4 and other hydrocarbons to form ozone, which is a pollutant causing respiratory illness and crop damages. At lower atmosphere, the reradiated sun’s energy from the Earth surface is adsorbed atmospheric gases mainly by CO2, N2O, and CH4 and cause warming of the earth surface, which is known as “Greenhouse Effect”. Both the destruction of ozone layer in stratosphere and the warming effect in the lower atmosphere by greenhouse gases are driving global climate change, resulting global warming (i.e. rise on the Earth’s surface temperature). The consistent rise on the global temperature after the Industrial Revolution (1750 – 1850 AD) has become a major threat to the Earth system including human.
Of all the greenhouse gases, CO2 is most critical one in relation to its increasing concentration and volume as well as its atmospheric heating effect. Available literature suggests that the volume of atmospheric CO2 has increased by more than 40% compared to pre-industrial era (1750 AD) and has higher than any point in the past 800,000 years. In fact, based on the measurement of atmospheric CO2 concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, USA, which was about 315 PPM in 1950’s has now reached to 410.31 PPM as of August 2, 2019. This steady increase in CO2 concentration has been very closely associated with the global temperature rise, which was below 0o C until 1940, fluctuated positively and negatively during 1940-1980, and then rising consistently above 0o C and reaching almost 1o C in 2010. Therefore, there is an urgency to check the global temperature rise, which is possible only by controlling primarily the emissions of CO2 and other GHGs. Rise on the global temperature influences precipitation, wind direction, ocean currents, and many other weather variables resulting in the changes of existing climates across the globe. Melting ice caps, sea level rise, extreme rain events, flooding, hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, and emerging new diseases and pests are clearly associated with the global warming and climate change. Climate change impacts to lands, waters, forests, food production, plant and animal species, cultural heritage sites, tourism, people’s livelihoods, public health, natural ecosystems, and many others ecosystem processes.
Detecting the destruction of ozone layer “ozone hole” above Antarctic, rising global temperatures, global environmental change, frequent incidences of natural disasters, and other economic and ecological degradation, the United Nations and many other agencies have worked tirelessly in bringing the global community together to tackle the problem of global climate change. They have put remarkable efforts on several environmental/climatic aspects including the understanding of the basic science behind global climate change, ban on the production of ozone depleting substances, predicting effects of climate change, providing policymakers with scientific information on climate change, and developing climate action programs over the past fifty years. Some of the major climate change initiatives taken by the UN can be listed as the creation of the UNEP, UNFCC, Conference of Parties (CoP), IPCC, and hosting annual CoP meetings. Various UN initiatives and undertakings on climate change have resulted a plethora of policy recommendations, action plans, strategies, and future paths for controlling GHGs emissions, assessment of climate change impacts, mitigation measures, adaptation to climate change, and global declarations. Among several declarations, the Montreal Protocol (1987), the Kyoto Protocol (1997), the Paris Agreement (2015), the Sendai Framework for Disaster Reduction (2015) and UN SDGs (2015) keep very high significance when it comes to global climate change, greenhouse gas reduction, adaptation, sustainable development, poverty eradication, and disaster risk reduction and mitigation.
According to 2014 IPCC report, CO2 consists of 76% of the total volume of the global greenhouse gas emissions (65% fossil fuel and industrial processes and 11% forestry and other land use), methane consists of 16%, nitrous oxide 6%, and remaining 2% is occupied by fluorinated gases. Therefore, carbon dioxide is the single most important gas from global warming point of view, however, not to undermine the importance of other gases in global warming. Global agriculture shares about 20% of the carbon equivalent emission of the three main greenhouses gases, CO2, CH4, and N2O. Published in 2018, the IPCC special report “Global Warming of 1.5o C” presents the impacts of global warming of 1.5o C above pre-industrial level, and discusses related greenhouse gas emission pathways. Mitigation measures to keep global warming as close as possible to 1.5o C include: the reduction in energy demand, decarbonization of electricity and other fuels, electrification of energy end use, deep reductions in agricultural emissions, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with carbon storage on land or sequestration in geological reservoirs, and low energy demand and low demand for GHG-intensive consumption goods. Climate change adaptation should be undertaken while ensuring sustainable development and poverty eradication.
As the Paris Agreement sets the goal of limiting global temperature rise less than 2o C, which has already increased by almost 1o C compared to pre-industrial global temperatures, this agreement aims at climate change adaptation by developing countries with sufficient support from developed countries. The climate actions undertaken should be within the context of 2030 UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, the Sendai Framework on disaster Risk Reduction by UN member states presents another critical element with regard to the overall success of the Climate Action and SDGs initiatives. The Sendai Framework recognizes the roles of local governments, private sector and other stakeholders in reducing disaster risk and mitigation. While both the developed and developing countries are heavily focused on the implementation of various climate change initiative and action plans, developing countries are struggling with establishing appropriate linkages between global initiatives and their national, regional, and local climate change action plans and programs. In the absence of an appropriate local framework where these global climate change initiatives and plans fit and operate smoothly, successes in local level climate change adaptation, especially by the developing countries, are far-fetched. In addition, developing countries are in the need of appropriate policy guidance, financial support, business opportunities, capacity-building, technical assistance, research and innovation, and global cooperation in relation to climate change adaptation. 
In the context of the “Asian Brown Cloud” and Global Climate Change adaptation in Nepal, as illustrated in figure 1, the Asta-Ja framework serves as a strong connector between grassroots communities and the national and global level climate change, sustainable development, and disaster risk reduction initiatives. Asta-Ja meaning eight Ja in Nepali letter “Ja”- meaning Jal (water), Jamin (land), Jungle (forest), Jadibuti (medicinal and aromatic plants), Janashakti (manpower), Janawar (animlas), Jarajuri (crop plants), and Jalabayu (climate), the Asta-Ja framework seeks sustainable conservation, development, and utilization of Asta-Ja resources for fast-paced socio-economic transformation of Nepal. The Jalabayu (climate) serves as the most critical and central driving factor for the Asta-Ja system. Any changes on weather or climatic conditions will influence all other Jas. Through the integration of Asta-Ja Framework in the implementation of climate actions, SDGs, and Sendai Disaster Risk Reduction initiatives, the local communities in Nepal will have better clarity on the relationship between the “Asian Brown Cloud”, Global Climate Change, climate change adaptation, natural resource management, income generation, and developing community resiliency. Grassroots communities, local governments, natural resource managers, businesses, and other stakeholders can relate, comprehend, and embrace the Asta-Ja Framework better. Therefore, for expedited climate change adaptation, poverty eradication, and sustainable development at the local level, a triangulated framework (fig. 1) with climate action, SDGs, Sendai disaster risk reduction and Asta-Ja Framework in the backdrop of “Asian Brown Cloud” is suggested. In addition, a strong working relationship between the countries in the region for a fight against the “Asian Brown Cloud” is necessary.",/international,"Tue, 03 Sep 2019 15:42:13 +0000"
37,http://telegraphnepal.com/kashmir-india-an-inherently-autocratic-country/,"N. P Upadhyaya, Kathmandu: Nepali Congress lawmaker Pradip Giri while making a statement on Kashmir in the Nepali Parliament recently, hinted that if India so desired, can make “Nepal as the second Sikkim”.
While making this announcement (perhaps on behalf of the Indian regime?), Pradip Giri unknowingly said “After Sikkim…India has gulped Kashmir”. He has used the word “KHAYO” whose literal meaning is …… “Gulped”.
In saying so Nepali Congress parliamentarian Pradip Giri admitted that Kashmir had been “consumed” by the Indian establishment. Now nothing remains to add.
But yet some “highly” intelligent Nepali media men, my own colleagues, have in an oblique manner begun writing that Kashmir aggression was not an issue that should be of some cause of concern to others since it was an internal matter of India. They hinted that Nepal must not exhibit any concern or whatsoever.
However, my contention has been that “it is not India’s internal matter but instead it is a “disputed territory” awaiting the promised UN plebiscite for self-determination plus pending twelve UN resolutions which has made the Kashmir imbroglio as a “bilateral dispute” in between India and Pakistan.
The fresh UNSC closed door meet this month too talked on the same line. Host of world leaders have urged India and Pakistan to take up the issue bilaterally.
President Trump just the other day in France talked with PM Modi on Kashmir which forced Modi to tell the international media that “we are ready to talk with Pakistan at the bilateral level”.
So we think the Indian occupied Kashmir issue is not an internal issue but a matter that is awaiting a final solution through the execution of the promises made to the people by Pundit Nehru and the United nations on several occasions over these seven decades.
As of why we are interested on Kashmir issue is that, firstly peace in Kashmir is directly linked to the prevalence of peace and stability in the South Asian region and Nepal is a country which falls in this vast landmass. This is our primary concern.
Secondly, Nepal being the Chair of the SAARC regional body, as a sensible and peace loving Nepali we have the right to ask both India and Pakistan to resolve the issue as per the resolutions of the UN and also abiding by the Shimla agreement.
Writes veteran journalist Anil Giri for the Kathmandu Post that “Amid escalating tension between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s move on Jammu and Kashmir, both countries have confirmed their participation of SAARC Council of Ministers at foreign ministers’ level to be held in New York. In September both India and Pakistan will come face to face at the United nations general Assembly. The meet has been arranged by the current Chair of the SAARC. It could be a good start . 
Is the SAARC still alive? Perhaps yes. Let’s hope that both India and Pakistan tone down their rough and tough words being made against each other sine August 5, 2019 over Kashmir.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Nepal has made it known that “bilateral” talks should continue for resolving the Kashmir issue for the regional stability.
We shall write against the Indian annexation simply because if India has the right to poke its nose on Nepal’s exclusive Terai/Madhesh issue (as it poked in the recent past if my friends recall) then why not I should be allowed the right to talk and debate on an issue that the world has taken as one which remains a “disputed territory”.
Why my intimate colleagues were silent when their own country’s Madhesh/Terai was made the target by the Indian management some three years back?
No spin can put a rosy picture on what is happening in J&K as a whole, my own media colleagues should keep this in mind. The dispute remains. Let’s agree to disagree.
If India can intervene in Nepali affairs then why not a sensible Nepali media man be not allowed to talk on a disputed territory which has been all along these seven decades a potential flash point.
Nepal has reasons to get scared with the continued Kashmir conflict.
Mind it, what if India or Pakistan pushed to the wall and one of the two press the nuclear button? In such a scenario, shall Nepal remain safe? Or even the world?
Early this week, the Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan while making a special address to the nation, Monday August 26 said that Islamabad’s Kashmir policy was at a “decisive” point as he slammed India for playing what he called “its last card” and vowing to “take next step”.
He further noted that “If the [Kashmir] conflict moves towards war then remember both nations have nuclear weapons and no one is a winner in a nuclear war. It will have global ramifications.
The superpowers of the world have a huge responsibility…whether they support us or not, Pakistan will do everything possible”.
With Pakistan failing to get traction for its belligerent stand on Kashmir, Prime Minister Imran Khan asked Pakistanis to not get disheartened by the silence of Islamic nations on Kashmir.
The fact is that the Muslim countries have cheated Pakistan in a way that suited those most. To some extent Iran came to the forefront in favor of Pakistanis or say for the Kashmiri people.
He said that Islamic nations may be silent on Kashmir now but there will come a time when they will have to speak up, reports the India Today from Delhi dated August 26, 2019.
PM Khan plans that he will tell the world about this.
He says, “I have shared this with heads of state that I have been in contact with. I will raise this issue at the UN as well”.
PM Khan is to address the UNGA on September 27 next month.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

This will be PM Khan’s first speech at the UN which will give him an opportunity to talk his brain and mind on the Kashmir issue that has evolved of late.
He called on Pakistanis to stop work for half an hour on Friday as a mark of solidarity with Kashmiris. And the whole of Pakistan came to a standstill this Friday.
Pakistanis brought the nation to a standstill at midday Friday as they gathered for “Kashmir hour” to show their solidarity with the disputed region, after India stripped the state of Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and reclassified it as a union territory earlier this month, writes Jennifer Hauser and Bianca Britton, for the CNN August 30, 2019.
Pakistan’s prime minister has once again promised to raise the issue of rights violations allegedly perpetrated by India in the disputed region of Kashmir at the UN this September, as tens of thousands held protests across the country expressing solidarity with the Kashmiris.
“The whole world should have stood with Kashmir,” Prime Minister Khan said at a rally of thousands outside his office in the capital Islamabad on Friday August 30.
He lamented that the world powers and the UN Body too were conspicuously silent on Kashmir.
The United Nations has a responsibility, says PM Khan, to ensure the people of Kashmir had the right to decide their own future through a referendum, he said, but the global body was “standing with the powerful countries”.
Perhaps the UN body is biased, it is so believed in Nepal. For weaker and small countries, the UN has only lip service, it has been noted several times in the past.
A news from the TRT world dated August 23 or 24 states that “The Indian government’s actions have subjected New Delhi to strong condemnation from human rights groups, such as Amnesty
International (AI), which called on the UN Security to intervene in defense of the people of Kashmir.
But in sum, Pakistan has the reasons to conclude that “all that glitters is not gold”. The Muslim countries’ unity is just a farce as has been seen in the issue pertaining to the plight of the Kashmiri people.
Where is the much talked Muslim Renaissance?
In the meanwhile, writes for the Hindu daily (India) Sriram Lakshman from Washington dated August 30, 2019, about the short comment issued by US leader Ilhan Omar of the Democratic Party on the issue of Kashmir.
She says, “I am excited to see so many members joining us in calling attention to what is happening in Kashmir. Please continue to call your members and ask them to speak up. We expect openness from India”.
Ilhan Omar is a democrat elected from Minnesota State who tweeted referring to a comment from Ted Lieu, a California democrat in the US House of Representatives.
The number of lawmakers commenting on Kashmir could possibly increase when the Congress, which is in recess, reconvenes in September, so believes Sriram Lakshman.
Remarkably, in an Op-ed in the New York Times on Friday August 30, 2019, the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that “If the world does nothing to stop the Indian assault on Kashmir and its people, there will be consequences for the whole world as two nuclear armed states get ever closer to a direct military confrontation”.

Let’s now listen and read as to what this distinguished diplomat has to say on Kashmir.
Writes William Milam August 25, 2019 in South Asia Journal in one of his fresh article titled Authoritarianism marches on in South Asia that as the hegemon of South Asia, doing what it wanted to because it could. Perhaps it acted more brutally because unlike Crimeans, many of whom surely wanted to join Russia, very few of the Mulsim majority of the Kashmir valley, wanted Kashmir to be incorporated into the Indian State. Given the history of the past 70 years when it has enjoyed “special status,” which was supposed to mean semi-autonomy, this has been the thin reed the Muslim Kashmiris have held onto as their lifeline to real autonomy, even independence. In fact, the autonomy so dearly held, began to slip away in 1954, which totally disappeared in the years since…..Autonomy was a word for many years in Kashmir, though there was little or none, and India has ruled Kashmir directly and openly, with the help of many thousands of troops, since the late 1980s.
William Milam is the writer and is an American diplomat and Senior Policy Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. The article appeared in the Friday Times on 23 August 2019.
He then adds, “what else can you call India’s action vis a vis Kashmir but an annexation? It flaunted (the) democratic norms as well as international agreements.
Mr. William has served as Ambassador to Pakistan and Bangladesh.
In the meantime, a high drama unfolded at the Srinagar airport as Opposition leaders led by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi reached the region to review the situation in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K).
As soon as Rahul Gandhi alighted from the flight with a dozen of Opposition leaders and dozens of media personnel, he was received by scores of police personnel inside the airport.
Taken aback by the large media presence, the Jammu and Kashmir police roughed up reporters and camerapersons blocking their way out. Some men in colored uniform pushed the journalists in and out of the airport, leading to chaos at the arrival, so writes Mausami Sing for India today dated August 25, 2019.
Similarly, Arundhati Roy says on Kashmir, (sic)” When it ends, as it must, the violence that will spiral out of Kashmir will inevitably spill into India. It will be used to further enflame the hostility against Indian Muslims who are already being demonized, ghettoized, pushed down the economic ladder and, with terrifying regularity, lynched”.
Ms. Arundhati writes this in an article “The silence is the Loudest Sound” in The Caravan dated August 26, 2019. This article was first published in the New York Times. She ventilates her inner feelings and says, “Echoes of fascism in the Kashmir valley”.
And here is Prof. Dr. Claude Rakisits, a strategic analyst interested in South Asian affairs who says that “if what Modi did was for the good of Kashmiris (then) why it is national Indian leaders are not allowed into Kashmir. No spin can put a rosy picture on what is happening in J&K as a whole”.
For the Road: Security forces in Indian-administered Kashmir have been accused of carrying out beatings and torture in the wake of the government’s decision to strip the region of its autonomy.
Shamir Hasmi of the BBC August 29, 2019, heard from several villagers who said they were beaten with sticks and cables, and given electric shocks.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Residents in several villages showed me injuries. But the BBC was not able to verify the allegations with officials.
The Indian army has called them “baseless and unsubstantiated”.

In the meanwhile, the United States on Thursday said that it was “very concerned” about reports of detentions and restrictions imposed in Indian occupied Kashmir.
Speaking to the media, US State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said, “The US is watching the situation in Jammu and Kashmir closely. We continue to call for calm and restraint, including on rhetoric”, writes Suhasini Haidar for the Hindu Daily August 30, 2019.
Ortagus said the US encouraged solving issues between Pakistan and India through dialogue, adding that “they [US] were concerned about the forced detention and curfew.”
Pointedly notes widely acclaimed strategist ‘Michael Kugleman’ in one of his old article titled “India’s sudden Kashmir move could backfire badly” dated August 5, 2019, had hinted that, (sic)
“India may be world’s biggest democracy, but the way Article 370 is being repealed in inherently autocratic –dictated from a distant center with no input from the people most affected”. His article has been published in the Foreign Policy magazine.

38,http://telegraphnepal.com/will-muslim-renaissance-encourage-clash-of-civilization/,"N. P Upadhyaya, Kathmandu: The experienced and the most knowledgeable Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad has set the ball rolling. Where the rolling ball collides will be premature to tell.
Yet the debate has already begun.
The message Dr. Mahathir has preferred to air by being in the friendly country Turkey’s soil July 26 last month if handled and led well by competent leaders with conscience then his idea (which still is in its embryonic form) may restore the lost glory of the Muslim civilization that it was for centuries across the world, but on the contrary if the said idea is led by an incompetent and less knowledgeable Muslim leader(s) then it is almost sure to bring in catastrophe in the world with the painful beginning of what the all-time respected and honored political scientist Samuel P Huntington said of the likely advent of “Clash of Civilization”.
To recall, Samuel Phillips Huntington was an American political scientist, adviser and an academic of the Himalayan order.
Huntington spent more than half a century at Harvard University, where he was director of Harvard’s Center for International Affairs.  He authored the book “The Third Wave of Democracy”.
The third wave of democratization described the global trend that had seen more than 60 countries throughout Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa undergo some form of democratic transformations beginning the early 1990s.
However, the trend that saw the wave of democratization has faded to a greater extent.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Classic case could be Nepal’s Democracy now being run by top class capitalist communists.
If and when Clash of Civilization begins as stated by Professor Huntington then the globe may become an uneasy place to live in for todays’ human beings including those also who now prefer to forge wider unity for the restoration of their lost glory.
However, let’s not discuss the absurd for the time being. The intent for the unity is entirely different here.
Dr. Mahathir during his a four days official visit to Turkey all of a sudden mooted the idea (though not a new one) of what could be called as the “Muslim Renaissance”.
According to the Wikipedia (courtesy the Google) the Islamic Golden Age was a period of cultural, economic and scientific flourishing in the history of Islam, traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 14th century. This period is traditionally understood to have begun during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun Ul Rashid (786 to 809) with the inauguration of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad where scholars from various parts of the world with different cultural backgrounds were mandated to gather and translate all of the world’s classical knowledge into Arabic. This period is traditionally said to have ended with the collapse of the Abbasid caliphate due to Mongol invasions and the siege of Baghdad in 1258 AD. A few contemporary scholars place the end of the Islamic Golden Age as late as the end of 15th to 16th centuries.
If it is this Muslim glory Dr. Mahathir prefers to restore then he would be the best person to tell the world, at least the Muslim realm that these were his schemes and technique(s) to get back to the same prestige of the Islamic world or else, in the existing global politics where political alignment and realignments occur every other minutes, Dr. Mahathir is sure to fail in his pious propositions.
Interestingly, the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan too endorses the school of thought subscribed by Dr. Mahathir. Understandably, who would say no to Unity?
And this the host President Erdogen did while addressing a joint news conference July 26.
The senior world leader Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad said the cooperation between the two countries will help to relieve the Muslim Ummah from being subjugated.
In fact, the use of the word subjugation by Dr. Mahathir must have some meaning and substance.
But what remains yet unanswered because he has yet to spell its literal underlying meaning. It would have been better had the Malaysian Prime Minister talked at length on what he meant by the word subjugation and if so then by whom or which countries?
He however, did not clarify the word “subjugation” and thus left it to be understood by observers what suited to their own preferred versions.
Nepali observers yet wish to opine Dr. Mahathir’s use of the term subjugation could have been directed towards some powerful countries who prefer to take the Muslims and their countries in a somewhat distorted manner which Dr. Mahathir perhaps prefers to dismiss these outdated notions by forging what he calls a “comprehensive” unity among the Muslim countries scattered in different continents of the globe. Mahathir though dismisses but the fact is that the suppression remains intact.
President Erdogen said that “unity among the Islamic world is necessary”.
And here is the biggest surprise of it all.
Dr. Mahathir preferred to begin with this unity among the Muslim countries by including the name of Pakistan whose representation was absent while Mahathir was proposing for such a Muslim unity and President Erdogen was endorsing the Malaysian Premier’s proposition.
Why only the three countries?




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

This is baffling in that how the whim of two countries could, for example, Turkey and Malaysia, without the approval of the third country that is Pakistan could include the name of a country which is absent while declaring such a unity? This is absurd. But yet it did happen and the absent country Pakistan in this case, duly approved it in a beaming mood as if everything was pre-set and that even in absentia, Pakistan appreciated her inclusion in the three country alliance that is, as per Prime Minister Mahathir would work for what is called a broader unity among the Muslim countries.
The Pakistani Minister for Foreign Affairs Shah Mahmood Qureshi on July 27 welcomed the emphasis laid by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad that Pakistan, Turkey and Malaysia for forging a broader unity. Qureshi was then in Islamabad.
Minister Qureshi in absentia had lauded the unity what has been coined as the “Muslim renaissance” by Prime Minister Mahathir and President Erdogen. He was all praise for this tri-lateral alliance.
Minister Qureshi says that “he was privileged to be part of the Ministerial meeting of the three countries on the sidelines of OIC’s Makkah Summit” that was held in Saudi Arabia in the recent months.
This does mean that Pakistan’s assurance was already there for the two countries, Turkey and Malaysia, for such a declaration which is what has happened and come to true.
“If you look at the past, Turkey was the savior of the Muslim Ummah in those days, but for reasons that few are able to understand we now have no Muslim country to stand up and protect us, but that doesn’t mean that this should be forever,” said a somewhat pained Mahathir Mohamad July 26, last month in Ankara.
His hopes are still kicking and alive. But his pain is visible.
Though the inner structure of this (would be) Muslim unity is not known but yet what PM Mahathir perhaps wants is “rebuilding and restoring the strength of Islamic civilization and also desires the Muslim countries to remain united and henceforth work closely being together”.
However, what is not known is whether this “Muslim renaissance” campaign shall include other Muslim countries and expand its scope and reach so that the voices of the Muslim countries will be heard by the powerful countries or not remains yet undisclosed.
The timing of this announcement is intriguing in that the OIC is in itself a big conglomerate of Muslim countries already in existence and yet Turkey and Malaysia think of forging unity (?) among the Muslim countries afresh and that too beginning with only three countries that includes Pakistan?
Is it that Turkey and Malaysia were not that happy with the functioning of the Organization of Islamic Countries?
Has the OIC become so incompetent and redundant that the two matured Muslim leaders felt the need to work for greater unity among the countries which are already in the OIC?
If not then what more Mahathir and President Erdogen desire from what they have declared just in Ankara?




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Look what Prime Minister Mahathir has to say for the most desired unity and to attain what purpose? He says, (sic), “Today, we cannot claim to be a great civilization,” he said. “We are all oppressed and many of us are very backwards to the point of even not being able to set up the government of our own countries.” Muslim countries, he said, should address their dependence on other countries.
Is it that Dr. Mahathir has felt the continued pain of the Muslim community across the world more so in India (and China?) after the Prime Minister Modi’s election victory and the Hindutva fanaticism that has gripped the entire Indian Union? Or he is pained at the manner the Muslims have been demoralized across the globe by powerful countries? Is it that the Malaysian Prime Minister wants to revive the lost Muslim glory (of the Mughals also) which at some point of time remained as a dominant world power or at least in this part of the world?
And more so who is the oppressor as per Dr. Mahathir? So the Muslim countries first should locate and recognize the oppressor first and then take initiatives at forming broader unity as desired.
If not the OIC, then what? One of Dr Mahathir’s closest strategists and thinkers, Rais Husin, has proposed an Alliance of Muslim Nations, which he believes would have the potential to reshape the world order, claims Solto Byrnes in the Erasmus Forum dated 29 July last month.
Mr. Byrnes is a commentator and consultant in Kuala Lumpur and a corresponding fellow of the Erasmus Forum.
“The Islamic world needs a renaissance,” said Huseyin Bagci, an expert in International relations at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara.
The International relations expert further said that “and Prime Minister Mahathir made a right point that these countries (Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia) at least start new projects which make Muslim world compatible and competitive in Islamic sciences, technology, defense, etc.,” Bagci said.
Scholar Bagci agreed saying the three countries have common values in democracy, human rights and free press.
He noted that Turkey, Malaysia and Pakistan stand out from the Arab world.
It is here that the scholar prefers to separate the Muslims living in Turkey, Malaysia and Pakistan with the Muslims living in the Arab world.
Moreover, a free press and the prevalence of a democratic system in the Muslim countries may also distance few countries from the others where free press and democratic system were absent.
These two points too may bring differences among the Muslim countries who are rigid to some extent and thus no “unity” as desired by Malaysia and Turkey.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

part from these short comings mentioned above, there could be more other reasons for Dr. Mahathir’s proposition for a unity to take roots, however, the notion for having unity amongst the countries practicing the same religion mustn’t be discouraged. It is a welcome move provided the goals and the objectives are sacrosanct. Or else, the powerful countries shall prefer to play and finally break the unity.
Having said that, yet it is hard to guess why for is the urgency of such a Muslim renaissance and that too so abruptly? To achieve what? Aimed against which power? Is it China or India whose Muslim population are in trouble at the moment? India being our next door neighbor, we in Nepal understand that the Indian Muslims, in minority, are suffering the worst and that the Hindu terror Machine led by Prime Minister Modi is hell bent on humiliating or even lynching the Muslims in India.
Needless to say, the Muslim countries sharply differ with each other and that is why they are weak comparatively speaking.
In addition, some are rich and others are literally very poor.
The Ankara scholar, according to Anadolu Agency website dated 26 July, says that Arab world is different than the Muslims of Turkey, Malaysia and Pakistan. Both are Muslim countries though.
This in itself could be the beginning of the possible rupture of the yet to be formed unity among the Muslim nations.
Is this rich-poor gulf weakening the Muslim countries? Or the division created by the Shia and the Sunni sects inside the Muslim world itself has made them weaker in essence?
The level of ties of the some Muslim countries with the USA could also make a difference in going together unitedly. For example, Saudi Arabia is comfortable with the USA then Iran is not.
Now the triple Talaq verdict by the Supreme Court of India too in some way or the other may impact in the lives of the Muslim population in some countries. For some, the Indian example could be desirable and adorable one and for others it may be not. It is again this differing opinions on Tripple Talaq among the Muslim countries which shall distance some countries with the other.
The Indian Muslims were themselves divided by this Talaq verdict in India. Debates have just begun.
And the Kashmir issue is being deliberately ignored by some “Muslim” countries fearing that raising Kashmir atrocities committed by India over these seven decades shall damage their bilateral ties with India.
It is here Pakistan falls flat. So how Pakistan should behave with those Muslim countries who have left Pakistan to fight the war on Muslim population alone with India? Should Pakistan fight with those countries? Certainly not. However, all Pakistan can do is to bring in support from these countries. And what about Turkey and Malaysia? Have these countries taken a factual stand that is there on the continued plight of the Kashmir population? It is time Turkey and Malaysia should speak in clear terms. (The OIC meet this time took note of Kashmir issue some months back).
And it is these differences primarily that shall be cashed in upon by those, let’s say some powerful countries or better say the Oppressors as Dr. Mahathir says, who do not wish that the Muslim countries unite for multiple reasons.
The problems of Rohingyas could also be one reason that keeps some Muslim countries at a distance with others.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

So a host of issues and matters of concerns will have impact on the unity to what Mahathir has proposed or say envisioned.
As regards the Uighurs Muslims in China, we don’t have much knowledge about them and thus it would be inappropriate to delve on a topic where we in fact possess least knowledge.
As regards Uighur Muslims, opinions among Muslim countries too may differ for some known and even unknown reasons which definitely are of political in nature. China friendly countries may even ignore the plight of the Chinese Muslims.
However, what we have come to understand very freshly that in a matter of days that in the Indian occupied Kashmir some sort of bombshell is about to explode which might deteriorate the security situation in and around the troubled valley.
Ajit Doval has already entered into the Kashmir Valley with thousands and thousands of military men which may trigger fight in between the two known rivals, India and Pakistan, demanding President Trump’s immediate mediation.
The taming of the Kashmiri civilians must have already begun and they were Muslims.
For the Road: Broader unity must be forged for the larger interest of the people, however, such a unity must not be directed against any other existing civilizations.
One civilization can’t flourish at the cost of other equally important civilization. Care should be taken that existing tolerance between differing civilizations must not get disturbed. We wish Dr. Mahathir a grand success in his “unity mission”. He has pinned high hopes in a nuclear and democratic Pakistan, it is distinctly visible. Now it is time Pakistan should act to fulfill Dr. Mahathir’s desire as a gift. If his gestures brings in unity among the Muslim Countries then why not? That’s all.",/international,"Fri, 02 Aug 2019 04:38:34 +0000"
39,http://telegraphnepal.com/imran-khan-is-a-charismatic-persona-people-rejoicing-dr-sigdel/,"Dr. Anil Sigdel, Director of Nepal Matters for America, Washington D.C
The telegraphnepal.com approached July 27, 2018, Dr. Anil Sigdel who is currently the Director of Nepal Matters for America, based in Washington D.C. for a brief talk on the much publicized Pakistan election wherein veteran Cricketer Imran Khan has emerged with flying colors.
Mr. Khan will be sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Pakistan shortly.
Mr. Sigdel, born in Nepal, obtained his doctoral degree in International Relations from the University of Vienna, Austria.
Below the results of our brief talks with Doctor Sigdel: Upadhyaya.
Q1: The opposition parties in Pakistan have denounced the election alleging that it was not a free and fair election. What say you Mr. Sigdel? 
Dr. Sigdel: “The Election Day was orderly and competitive according to the preliminary assessment of the mission of the European Union observers. As for the restrictions on freedom of expression, or unequal opportunities to campaign, the EU itself does not confirm it but mentions the accusations.
One must respect the fact that Pakistani citizens have exercised their right to vote. And even Liberal Pakistan has also voted, given a mandate to someone new, in a country that is desperate for positive change.

As for the real evidence, I think it is difficult to produce it because what the opposition refers to is the conspiracy of “established powers” such as the powerful Pakistani Army, the part of the judicial power control, and fundamentalist groups among others, to influence the results of the elections in favor of Imran Khan.
Q2: Is it that Imran Khan got elected only because he, as his detractors allege, have had links with the Military establishment at time of the election? Or it is just a propaganda spread by the opposition to malign Imran Khan political credentials? 
Dr. Sigdel:  “It is difficult in Pakistan to make policy without being on good terms with the powerful army. But I would not say it’s a puppet in the hands of the Army, but I can believe that there has been some tactical alliance and some understanding. But for Imran Khan for 22 years, he is fighting in Pakistan politics.
The people of Pakistan have a lot of hope in him, and they are celebrating.
He is a charismatic personality and liberal Pakistan also somehow wants to give him the benefit of doubt. The results of the elections are competitive: And although Imran Khan’s PTI came out victorious, Nawaz Sheriff’s PML-N was first in the province of Punjab, the most dominant in Pakistan’s politics. At the national level, first, PTI, second PML-N, and third is Bhutto’s PPP. PTI has been left without the simple majority of 2/3 – 137 (272), 115
The Army cannot come to the front and govern directly – due to internal and external problems, thus reaching an agreement with someone is their need as well. Nawaz Sheriff was also a selection of Army at the beginning and then he changed into an independent leader in terms of foreign policy as well. How things will go with IK and Pakistan Army it remains to be seen.
Q3: Do you consider Imran Khan as still a play boy as some of his detractors in the West take him or he is a different political personality now? 
Dr. Sigdel: He is a Taliban sympathizer! … It is important that politics is going to have towards extremists in Pakistan. His PTI party has given a lot of money to Madrassas-religious colleges of Islam in his Khyber Pakhtunkhwa base region in the north.

As for the image of the Playboy, it is his past. He himself has said that in the past he has made mistakes. Now he’s been with his conservative life for some time now. If you look at his personal life, politics, and his daily activities and ideas, he is definitely a conservative figure. It’s funny because being a cricket legend, he spoke English like a Briton, it’s a bit contradictory, but he also had his traditional ideas with him. One example, the fact that his two children with their first British wife have a Muslim name says something, that is, he had not internalized Western culture at all, even though it seemed so on the outside.
To sum up, I would conclude by saying this:
# On India: Kashmir issue will gain salience.
# Pakistan preference China.
# Afghanistan- open border—much priority
# Not easy for India which preferred Sheriff
But people in India love Imran, so some window there.",/international,"Sat, 28 Jul 2018 00:52:18 +0000"

When we look back into the border business between Nepal and China, Sino-Nepal Boundary Agreement was done on March 21, 1960.
Author: Buddhi Narayan Shrestha
As a consequence, Nepal-China Boundary Treaty was signed on October 5, 1961. After the agreement and followed by a treaty, border demarcation works with the erection of pillars and markers started jointly in the field.
To materialize the demarcation work, Nepal-China Joint Boundary Committee was formed and field survey teams had been deputed to the border areas. During border demarcation, many of the spots of various segments, the boundary line was demarcated without any disputes.
However, there were some debates, disputes and controversies in 32 places along the boundary, including the peak of Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest).
At the time of demarcation it was adopted by both parties, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence and in a spirit of fairness, reasonableness, mutual understanding and most importantly respecting each other as Nepal and China have the equal rights and status in the international arena. It is commendable that all the disputes, claims and counter-claims were settled forever in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, friendship, mutual understanding and accommodation.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

With this spirit all the issues, except Mount Everest (Sagarmatha) had been settled by the Joint Boundary Committee. Regarding the question of Everest, the dispute was settled at the prime ministerial level and it was ended during the visit of the Prime Minister Chou En-Lai to Kathmandu, as he stated in a press meet on 28 April 1960 that ‘Mount Everest belongs to Nepal’ (Bhairab Risal September 9, 1999, Patrika Weekly).
In connection to the demarcation all the disputes had been settled and resolved amicably by November 1962 with a good understanding, traditional friendship, long term co-operation and mutual trust within a period of one and half years. After the completion of boundary demarcation work, Boundary Protocol was signed by the plenipotentiaries of both the countries on January 20, 1963.
Two issues have been emerged since 2007.
One of them is Border Marker Number 57, located at north of Lapchigaun (Korlangpari Tippa) in Lamabagar area of Dolakha district. There is a discussion on the location of this marker, as Nepal has claimed around 6 hectares of land.
The second issue is the height of Sagarmatha (Mount Everest). China has proposed to write the height as 8844.43 meter on the Nepal-China Strip-map. But Nepal is firm to mention the traditional height as 8848 mtr.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

China has pressed to take the so called rock height of Quomulungma (Mount Everest). On the contrary, Nepal has pleaded that unless and until we measure ourselves the height of Sagarmatha, we shall stuck on the traditional height. The next logic is that the snow height has been maintained for all the mountains by almost all the countries of the world. So the issues have been entangled and stranded.
During the demarcation in 1961-62, the disputed and amicably resolved 32 spots including the Mount Everest and presently emerged two minor issues have been tabulated as followings:

It would be appropriate and justifiable to consider the East India Company’s ulterior motive beforehand in invading Nepal at various eastern, southern and western lands. They had pre-planned objectives in spreading the colonial domination throughout the Indian subcontinent. To this end they covertly prepared themselves and launched war against Nepal. They succe
eded to some extent in dominating the Gorkhali fighting patriots at great cost. Under the cloak of intimidation, threat and coercion, the Treaty of Sugauli was concluded. It would be justifiable and helpful to discuss the mode and method of British offensive aggression prior to assess the validity, legality and occupation of the Nepalese territories by the British under threat, coercion and intimidation on the pretext of the so-called dictated Treaty of Sugauli.
The Sugauli Treaty also known as the Anglo-Nepal Treaty concluded under duress, intimidation, coercion and threat from the invading Colonial Power had forced the kingdom of Nepal to cede one third of Nepal’s territory to the East India Company in 1816. The ceded territory included most of the southern belts of plain lands and that of hilly regions west of the Kali River belt. Nepal was intimidated and forced to cede some territories east of the Mechi River also. After the conclusion of this Treaty, Nepal’s international boundary was transfixed to the Mechi River in the East and Kali River to the west.
Causes and Pretext:
The Mogul Empire was waning and declining in the eighteenth century. Invasion by the rulers of Persia and Afghanistan started in weakening the very foundation of the Mogul Empire. After such invasions the previous governors or agents of the British Empire in India such as Nawabs of Bengal and Oudh in the north and the Nizam of Hyderabad in the South made their mind to assert as independent powers. As a matter of fact, the main legitimate claimants and contenders were the respective native inhabitants including the invading East India Company. European colonialists- British, French and Portuguese were already indulged themselves in colonizing some parts of the territories in the subcontinent. The East India Company was very much concerned on the extension of the Gorkhali rule over these new territories that they planned to colonize within a favorable period of time. Nepal’s conquest or takeover of these parts of regions definitely thwarted the colonial interest. On top of that, the colonial power was very much susceptible about the likely unity and reemergence of the Sikhs, Marathas and Gurkhalis to fight against the colonial invasion and occupation. Taking all these accounts into consideration, the colonial power devised a plan of conspiracy overtly and covertly to thwart the reemergence of the Hindu emerging power unity. The East India Company in its mission got success in its plan to create vacuum and enmity among the Hindu reemerging powers themselves. The Company was not in a position to land the white British contingent in India due to the Napoleonic war effect and the Bengal Army under the clutch of the Company could not match against the Gorkhalis. To this context, the Company corroborated with the Sikhs and other neighboring powers and made an unholy alliance while invading Nepal.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The extended territories of Nepal covered on the frontier of Purnea in the east, on those of the frontiers of Gorakhpur and Saran to the South of Central Nepal and on the frontiers of Bareily in the west. It was common to emerge out some disputes on the adjoining borders of the two forces. The dispute arose since 1806 between Nepal and British India and reached on the height by 1814. The border dispute to the context of Gorakhpur and saran took the serious turn after the Butwal and Syuraj scuffle The Gorkhalis were compelled to capture 22 villages in the Saran district. The Nepali Government was ready and prepared to hand over the 22 districts as to be settled by the Commission. However, the Company mainly on the supervision and dominance of the Marquess of Hasting was determined to extend the British Government’s sovereignty over the lands in India controlled by the East India Company. This mandate was conferred on the renewed Charter of the Company. Thus, the Company’s Government was the first to use force to invade and capture Butwal and Syuraj. As the Nepali forces recaptured these two villages on 29th May, the British planned overtly and covertly to invade Nepal from the west, south and east porous lands. The Government of Nepal could not reassess the mammoth military power of the invader and even ignored the strategic military advise of Bam Shah, Governor of Kumaun, Hastidal Shah, Governor of Doti and Amar Singh Thapa, Governor of the entire far west.
Invasion against Nepal:
The main strategy of the British colonialist was to subjugate whole of the Indian subcontinent. As they succeeded in their mission of subjugation in India, Nepal couldn’t have been spared. Due to the Napoleonic War, they had suspended their invasion to subjugate new territories. As the war with the French terminated by 1814, they instantly devised various pretexts in invading Nepal. To this context, according to the War History Records quoted by various historians in their valuable accounts of this particular war, they had accumulated and collected geographic and other strategic accounts of Nepal from various sources including those of Captain Kinloch in 1767, Kirkpatric in 1793 and Knox in 1804.
Declaration of War was made on 1 November 1814, though invasion started from the earlier periods. In accordance with the invading plan, the Company’s forces waged a five-pronged invasion from Rupar, Saharanpur, Gorakhpur, Saran and Purnea. The first division commanded by Colonel David Ochterlony consisting of 11,500 men was to invade the westernmost part of Nepal. The second division commanded by Major-General Robert Rollo Gillespie was to invade Garhwal. This force consisted of more than 15,000 persons. The third division commanded by Major-General John Sullivan Wood’s brigade consisted of 5,000 regular soldiers and about 1,000 irregulars and was based on Gorakhpur. Major-General Bennet Marley of the fourth contingent, who took responsibility to capture Kathmandu had 8,000 soldiers at his disposal. The fifth division under Captain Barre Latter consisting of 2700 men was assigned to watch the frontier between the Kosi and Tista rivers. This division was in anticipation of order to invade eastern Nepal at the appropriate time. In total nearly 45,000 men and 85 cannons were deployed against Nepal.
Nepal’s compulsion to withdrawal:
The Company’s forces almost simultaneously made force engagement and invaded with superior arms and ammunitions at Nalapani (Kalanga), Jaithak, Jitgarh, Kumaon, Almora, Deuthal and Malaun. The Gorkhali forces fought bravely. The invading forces had to suffer vehemently and could not defeat the Gorkhali forces in accordance with their military strategy. As they had superiority to men and materials, they easily reinforced on the battlefields. Brave fighting forces of Nepal couldn’t get any reinforcement of fighting men or of fighting materials despite the request or demand. They fought to the last of their strength for a long period. At last a few remaining brave Gorkhali patriot fighters had no alternative except to withdraw from the various war fronts and forts.
Effort for Negotiation:
Nepal was bound to withdraw from the battlegrounds as there were not reinforcement of men and materials for a considerable period of time. Nepal by May 1815 started negotiation. The courtiers Gajaraj Mishra and Chandrashekhar Upadhya were sent for this purpose. The negotiation couldn’t take effect as the British wanted that Nepal should handover all lands in the plains together with the territories to the west of River Kali. The British themselves prepared the text of draft treaty with all these provisions for cessions of the Nepalese Territories and sent to the Kathmandu Court for approval. The draft treaty submitted through Gajraj Mishra to Kathmandu contained an ultimatum to Nepal of twenty-one days in accepting the British proposal or stipulation. It also included the provision for payment of cash pensions to Nepalese officials in exchange for terai territory ceded to the East India Company. The effort of negotiation by Nepal failed completely when the Company’s hidden motive and intention was highlighted in the draft treaty. Nepal out rightly rejected the British Draft Treaty. As the proposals of the Company were not approved by Nepal, General Ochterlony was vestd with full authority in initiating a renewed invasion against valleys of Rapti, Makwanpur, Bagmati including to all battle zones held and fought by the Gorkhalis. To this context, Bhimsen Thapa made an alternative proposal to Colonel Bradshaw that cash payment should be substituted for cession of the terai. Bradshaw retorted that the draft treaty should be accepted and ratified first.
Nepal and ratification of the Treaty:
The Company’s forces mounted offensive attacks all over the kingdom of Nepal. By February 1816, they had captured Makwanpur and posed a direct threat to Kathmandu, Capital of Nepal. Creation of such threat and coercion on the part of the British compelled Nepal to accept and ratify the draft proposal that was done at Sugauli on 2 December 1815 only on 4 March 1816. However, this Treaty of Sugauli was amended on the ground of Memorandum presented by Nepal to the Company’s government on 8 December 1816. The amendment arranged to claim Nepal’s sovereignty over the land on the east and cancelled the Arrangement for payment by the Company’s Government to the Nepali officials through the King of Nepal.

International Practice in treaty making: 
A treaty is a basic document containing of agreed provisions between or among the sovereign states. From the time immemorial, treaty making practice could be found. This practice is binding as the tenets of International customary law and is valued as the primary source of the modern treaty law to the context of international treaty law. Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 has accumulated and codified all customary provisions and practices in the new Treaty. Moreover, this Treaty has affirmed in its Preamble that the rules of customary international law will continue to govern questions not regulated by the provisions of present Convention. To this end, ‘treaty’ means an ‘international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international Law’.
It is accepted in international practice that the main purpose to conclude the treaty is to promote peace and stability between or among the sovereign States Thus; provisions contained in the treaty must represent the inner voluntary consent expressed and abided by the treaty making Actors. If the treaty is executed by force, threat and coercion, it loses its binding validity and international legitimacy. Maintaining the binding customary norms of the international law of treaties, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties in Articles 51, 52 and 53 has provided:-
Article 51: The expression of a State’s consent to be bounded by a treaty which has been procured by the coercion of its representative through acts or threats directed against him shall be without any legal effect.’
Article 52: ‘ A treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force on violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.’ And
Article 53: A treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law. For the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.’
Sugauli Treaty and inconsistency:
It is crystal clear that the East India Company threatened intimidated and even coerced the king of Nepal which is transparent from the above mentioned facts and particulars. The British main intention to conclude and make ratification of this Treaty was to legitimize the illegal aggression and belligerent occupation of the Nepalese territories. Nevertheless, this Treaty falls under the category of Treaty of Cession. Various instances are to be found to the context of cession of territories. Legitimate cessions of the territories of another sovereign States are taken places only through voluntary consent and friendly behavior. In the context of Sugauli Treaty all the recognized norms propounded by the civilized community of nations have been disregarded. As the valid process in transferring the territory is made by the Treaty of Cession in good faith and voluntary intention, the Anglo-Nepal Treaty of Sugauli being the coerced and intimidated document cannot be considered as the valid and acceptable legal document to the context of internationally recognized norms, therefore, it is void ab initio. It is already stated that this treaty was forced on Nepal even by attacking the nearest Makawanpur valley when Nepal hesitated or disagreed in ratifying the Draft of Sugauly Treaty prepared by the Company on 2 December 1815. It is clear from the date of ratification on 4 March 1916, approximately after three months. How much coercion threat and intimidation would have weighed down on Nepal.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Transfer of sovereign territories is executed through the mutual agreements by the sovereign entities in the form Treaty of the Cession. International lawyers agree that a cession of territory following the defeat in war is more usual than annexation. They also hold the principle that a cession by treaty is void where the conclusion of the treaty has been procured by the threat or use of force. Examples of voluntary cession may be cited the sale of Alaska by Russia to the United States in 1867, and the exchange of Heligoland for Zanzibar by Germany and Great Britain in 1890. Compulsory cession is illustrated by the cession to Germany by France in 1871 of Alsace-Lorraine subsequently returned to France at the end of the First World War.
Right to claim over illegally occupied territory:
International community of nations started derecognizing such occupation by the invaders especially after the First World War. The Treaty of Versailles that produced the 1919 Covenant of The League of Nations also made provisions in restricting the right to resort war. The Briand-Kellog Pact also known as The Paris General Treaty for the Renunciation of War categorically prohibited recourse to war as an instrument of national policy. The UN Charter went much further and urged all member states to refrain from the use of force except in self-defense. In other words, direct use of force is strictly prohibited without the permission of the Security Council. Taking all these customary and treaty provisions of the International law norms, NEPAL has a right to get back the ceded territories.
Colonial Power, the British left India setting up new sovereign states that claimed sovereign statehood. Pakistan was one of them. Nepal didn’t bother to claim the illegally occupied territories and the government of Nepal is still not interested to raise the issue in international forum. How can Nepal regain its land when there is no claim at all? As it is seen that the vestige of colonial empire is duly transferred to the Republic of India, the sovereign people have every right to claim the lost territory of former Nepal. The outcome could be accepted as decided by the norms of State Practice and that of International Law.
Nepal and India have concluded Treaty of Peace and Friendship on the 31 July, 1950. Article 8 of this Treaty provides: ‘so far as matters dealt with herein are concerned, this Treaty cancels all previous treaties, agreements, and engagements entered into on behalf of India between the British Government and the Government of Nepal’. It is evident that the British invaded and occupied the territories of Nepal to extend the Indian colonial Empire. In relation to the British India occupation of the Nepalese territories, this quoted Article also has nullified the retention and occupation of the Nepalese territories by the Republic of India.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Rights to Self-determination:
Such rights are ensured by the provisions of the UN Charter. The UN Charter is a multilateral treaty and can lead to the formation of customary law. Resolution 1514 (XV), the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, adopted in 1960 states: ‘all people have the right to self-determination; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.’ If this Resolution is strictly observed former subjects of the Nepalese Territories now the subjects of the new sovereign State must be permitted to choose the sovereign status. Again in 1966, the General Assembly adopted the International Covenants on Human Rights. Both these Covenants declared: ‘peoples have the right to self-determination. Thus, the UN has based its policy on the proposition that ‘the territory of a colony has under the Charter a status separate and distinct from the territory of the State administering it.’
Conclusion:
It is evident from the above mentioned contention and argument that Nepal has the right to claim its lost territories as it was illegally occupied by the threat and use of Force. The elite and conscious Nepalese are confounded why the state machinery doesn’t venture to raise this issue formally. Since 1990, the Nepalese people have been designed as sovereign subjects of the country. Therefore, the sovereign craving of the people in restoring the illegally occupied territories to Nepal by the Colonial Power must be supplemented.

Concept of Sandwiched Nepal
For many years the so called architects of the domestic as well as foreign policy used to reiterate the saying Nepal is sandwiched between the two big giants and through this they used to conclude that because of this natural liability Nepal cannot be a prosperous country or full-fledged sovereign and fully independent country. They shifted the burden to the god or nature for this unfortunate state of being located between the two giant neighbors which caused Nepal to become a semi-feudal, semi-colonial and under developed state.
This is a misleading and stupid formulation. It is not the god or the nature to be blamed for the wretched condition of Nepal, but the reactionary system and foreign oppression and that prevailed in Nepal for centuries are mainly responsible for this situation. These are the man made causes. One of the main factors related to it is the wrong domestic and foreign policies.
It is true that our country is situated between the two giants not only of Asia, but of the world as well. To be situated in between the two large countries is neither bad nor good in itself. It all depends on how we behave and deal with them. If we are capable of behaving or treating our two big neighbors, China and India to serve the best interest of the people and state of Nepal, our location will be proved to be more useful than others. We have enough opportunities that we can extract from our natural location. To be situated in between the two big neighbors is not a liability in itself, it is the conscious effort that has to be taken to turn this location to our assets. It should be one of the guiding factors of our foreign policy.
Policy of Equi-proximity: 
The bilateral relation between India and China has been moving through twists and turns. During the 50s the relation between these two giant states seemed to be very warm, based on the slogan of India China bhaibhai (India and China are two brothers). This fraternity turned into hostility during 60s when ostensibly the border issue engaged them in a bloody war which naturally turned them to be the foes. Thereafter the relation between them was too sour, which took about three decades to arrive at normalcy.
In this circumstance it was little difficult for Nepal to adopt a balanced foreign policy with both the neighbors. Our southern neighbor has been able to utilize the 1,800 km. open border and system of free border crossing in its favor to exert its influence in Nepal. Mainly the 1950 treaty, which is considered as an unequal, has been used as a legitimate means to further the influence. The Northern neighbor does not have this advantage, having inaccessible 1, 000 km closed border.
There is broad consensus in Nepal at the question of equi-proximity relation between India and China. In fact this policy only can serve the interest of Nepal by maintaining balance in the relation of the two neighbors and taking benefit from the economic development of them. But in reality this policy has never been implemented. There is a real problem in implementing this policy, because our Southern neighbor is reluctant to this policy.
 




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

When one talks about equi-proximity policy, one has to face many difficulties and pressure. When the late Prime Minister Tanka Prasad Acharya tried to develop the bilateral relation with China, about 50 years ago, he was accused as pro- Chinese until he survived. Everybody knows that the elderly politician was not a Moist or communist, rather he was truly a patriot. 1-lowever, he was blamed as pro-Chinese only because he tried to think independently in foreign relation and for which he thought that developing relation with China was significant for the national interest of Nepal.
In the past, none of the governments were able to implement this equi- proximity policy, because, people who were holding the power were either pro-South or they were intimidated. Part of the foreign policy is economic diplomacy. There are many possibilities that can be explored with China. For instance, tourism is our most important sector for the economic development. We have already opened routes from India for the tourists, but we have become completely unable to open doors for the tourists en route to China. Quite a few years back, Beijing has linked Lhasa through the railways in which it is said almost 30 million tourists arrive in Lhasa every year.
Most of them are Buddhist. If we can extend the railways up to Lumbini the birth place of Buddha, and will be able to attract one third of it, it can be a great contribution in the development of tourism of Nepal. Instead of feeding the people of Humla by Indian rice transported by helicopter from Nepalganj, why we should not open road to the nearby market of Tibet of China and facilitate the local trade with Tibet, in which the local people become able to buy food grains by selling their own products. Looking through different points of view, the equi-proximity policy is properly justified.
Question of special relation: 
There is always a point of debate in the area of foreign policy regarding the question of special relation with India. It is true that Nepal and India has long standing relation, both at the level of the people of the two countries and that of the two governments. There is also open border of 1,800 kms between the two. Both Nepal and India are secular countries having predominantly Hindu population. There is a big question: whether these are the compelling conditions to declare that Nepal and India have a special relation? In a general sense one can say clearly No.
What does it mean by special relation in perspective of foreign policy? It is difficult question to answer. Because Nepal and India do not have special bloc, they do not have special alliance for or against, they do not have anything special that signifies the relation between the two countries as special relation.
There are agreements between the two countries which were signed in different period in different issues. Many of them are transparent but few of them are said to be still unknown to the public. Some of the treaties are widely known to be unequal. One of the most controversial accords is Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950, which is popularly known as 1950 Treaty.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

In the wake of big controversy of unequal treaties being signed between the two countries, the issue of special relation has caused a serious doubt in the area of politics and in the minds of patriotic people of Nepal. The terminology of friendly relation, good relation, excellent relation are generally in use in expressing the relation between the two independent countries. If there is something that signifies the special relation should be opened clearly for discussion. If it is only for the appeasement, the question of special relation should be discarded without any hesitance/hesitation. But till the date, nobody has become able to give convincing answer to this question.
Five principles of peaceful co-existence: 
Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence (FPPC) seems to be a good basis of foreign policy, through which we can establish, maintain and develop bilateral relation with any friendly country irrespective of its size, economic or military strength or political system. What political system is necessary and suitable for individual country is internal matter and the people of that country should decide about it without exception. External interference in the internal affair is completely and totally unacceptable. This objective can be largely achieved if all the states abide by the FPPC. Though no state in the world has challenged this principle openly, but the imperialist and expansionist states practice some principles which are quite opposite to the FPPC.
Nepal is an under developed, one of the poorest country of the third world. It is situated in between two giant neighbors. Based on various aspects the suitable basis of foreign policy for Nepal is FPPC. It is said that the basis of foreign policy of Nepal for many years has been FPPC. But in many cases Nepal was not able to maintain its independent character and stand by the FPPC. We should make the FPPC as basis of foreign policy for strongly safe guarding our national interest, not for its sacrifice. There are many instances that prove that Nepal has become unable to safeguard and promote its national interest. This situation should have to be completely changed.
Foreign policy should be developed:   
Foreign policy is not something isolated and separate from the domestic policy. It is rather the reflection and complementary of the domestic policy. There is no any scope of doubt that Nepal is undergoing through a process of political transformation and change. But the foreign policy is almost same as before. It is quite obvious that it should correspond to the transformation of Nepalese society and change in the domestic policy, otherwise there is a danger that the foreign policy will drag the domestic policy backward, which will obviously be a retrogressive step. Therefore Nepal needs the foreign policy to be developed which should correspond to the new political transformation, changes and development.

Conclusion: 
Nepal is one of the poorest third world country situated between the two giant neighbors. It is not correct to say that it is sandwiched in between the two huge states. We should not work with the sandwiched mentality. We can work and struggle as an independent country, which can formulate and implement correct foreign policy which can safeguard its national interest in best way. The general basis of foreign policy should be Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. Significant part of our foreign policy is to formulate correct policy in dealing with our two huge neighbors, for the benefit of our country, for which policy of equi-proximity with the two neighbors seems to be correct.
The other component of our foreign policy is to do away with all the unequal treaties signed in the past. But it is not a simple and an easy subject, because our southern neighbor will not be happy with this decision. The government should be bold enough to achieve this objective. The foreign policy is not something isolated or separate from the domestic situation and policy, rather it is reflection of it. It is fairly obvious that Nepal is undergoing through a process of transformation and change. This should be reflected in the foreign policy, which still remains the same. Therefore we should have to develop a new foreign policy that corresponds to the new political development of Nepal.

43,http://telegraphnepal.com/will-maos-china-help-preserve-nepals-sovereign-status/,"N.P. Upadhyaya; Kathmandu: As the saffron clad BJP leader Ms. Pragya Thakur and Minister Ashwini Choubey believe in the ‘Cow urine theory’ then should not Nepal’s incumbent Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli alias Kha. Pra. Sha. OO (abbreviated) should try the same Cow Urine for his damaged renal impairment and that too for free of cost?
As Nepal is comparatively a cold country than India, so the mother Cow that are born in Nepal must ooze healthy Urine which, as is the Indian theory which has been duly backed by Baba Ramdev-a thug Yoga Guru-is gaining more currency in the present day Hindustan or Bharat alias former British controlled landmass, if consumed by our ailing Prime Minister Oli then it can yield unbelievable results which is in Nepal’s fiscal interests as well.

It is the prevalence of this “greenery” and fertility in the Nepali land that the Maoists leaders like, for example, Dr. Babu Ram Bhattarai and Comrade Prachanda who have had even rejected the Indian government’s “secured hospitality” that the two were specially provided in India preferred to land ultimately in Nepal and the “carrier” was none less than our own towering political persona, Late Girija Prasad Koirala ( Rest in peace sir) who had been told by “Father Shyam Saran” to take them back to Nepal and capture the entire power structures in Kathmandu”. Since then Prachanda has begun loving “green” and his entire family members, are swimming in the green pond nonstop. Thanks RAW republic.
And in the process, the Indian orders made to Koirala was that together with the Maoists and the other five parties who had been agitating against the then Nepal sovereign, must converge at a point and up root the institution of the Nepali monarchy. And they did it.
In the recent years, Singapore for our “expensive” Prime Minister Oli is definitely a home away from home.
In addition to all these grandiose and Oli-fied propaganda, Prime Minister Oli has begun taking extra tutorial classes to his juniors in the Nepal Cabinet through not the Skype but known as a new technology what is known as “tele-presence”.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

This provides and inkling into the very possibility of PM Oli quite frequently visiting Singapore for his treatment. Not bad idea if the State money is free. But why it should be free for the PM only? In far flung areas inside Nepal people even have no penny to buy Para-cetamol tablets. Is the nationalist-communist-expensive PM listening?
The question thus is Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli paying the Singaporean Hospital bills from his personal pockets? This is the million dollar question where the lay men were more interested than, frankly speaking, in PM Oli’s health conditions. Indeed they wish him a good health and long life as a human being.
With due respect to PM Oli, he is the servant of the nation who has no authority to play kabaddi with the tax payers’ money.  The people are not Oli’s servants.
With malice to none more so to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli what the people would wish to tell him modestly but in a frank manner that “You have already proved yourself as the most “luxurious” Prime Minister ever we have had in the history”.
This is the message from this paper to Nepal PM that henceforth pay yourself for your health-repair if you love your people. That’s it. Plain and simple. It has been too much.
(We are speaking the people’s voices).
But if Mr. Prime Minister you have been paying the Singaporean hospital bills from your personal pocket then we apologize for whatever we have written against you.
Now let’s change the topic now.
Comrade Prachanda has become restive these days more so after the RAW man Amar Bhusan, released his book ‘Inside Nepal that claims “for the ouster of Nepali monarchy, the Indian intelligence agency RAW” had taken the meaningful support of then Delhi residing Maoists leader Prachanda”.
With this bombshell Prachanda appears shaken from within and thus his followers have begun disseminating the content of the book as a mere fiction-story.
Yes it is but the smart writer Amar Bhusan gives his book a twist and says that “it is based on a true story”. The question is how can a fiction story be so close to our own sad story that has robbed this nation not so in the distant past?




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

A treaty with India was signed by the Nepal Maoists according to some reliable sources in Nepal, on June 2002.
This has been in an implied manner accepted by senior analyst Bharat Dahal who once upon a time was himself a Maoists leader. People take his versions in good faith.
But Bharat Dahal left the Maoists’ fake uprising when he knew that the entire people’s war had been a design manufactured by the Indian government using Nepali nationals.
The fact is that much ahead of the publication of this book, the people in Nepal who were not the signatory of the “India drafted 12 point New Delhi agreement” knew it that it was late Koirala and the Maoists supremo when got “glued” under the instructions or say “orders” of the then Italy born Sonia Gandhi controlled Indian regime which was led by proxy Prime Minister Dr. Man Mohan Singh.
But the Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran later catapulted Nepali politics and since then the national politics is in the lap of the Indian establishment.
The publication of the Amar Bhusan’s book has come at a time when the Republican leaders’ installed by the Indian regime, as is presumed, have failed to take their “subjects” into confidence.
Beginning his daughters and the in-Laws and their near and distant relatives of Prachanda too have become an integral part of the Republican order.
This does mean that the one who most benefited from this Shyam-System is surely Comrade Prachanda and thus Amar Bhusan’s assertion that he sought the assistance of Prachanda in unseating the Nepali monarchy for good appears very close to the truth.
Even if it were a fiction then it fits into Delhi’s jacket gifted to Comrade Prachanda.
Ok let’s think for a moment that Prachanda was not in the game for the ouster of Monarchy so why he is so much scared? Though he is scared but yet has to clarify his stance.
In yet another “instructed structured twist” Mr. Madhav Kumar Nepal-the one who preferred the Indian military’s invasion of Nepal in order to tame King Birendra in 1990, has said that the Delhi 12 point agreement had not been drafted by the Indian side but by those political leaders who were the signatories of the said agreement.
Mr. Nepal’s fresh revelation, made in 2019, at best had been debunked by the then Indian foreign minister (who later became the Indian President) Pranav Mukherjee (the perverted brain and a declared hater of Sonia Gandhi) right back in 2009 had told the Al Jazeera TV that “the greatest achievement of his life was to send the Nepal Maoists to Kathmandu from Delhi and capture the power structure of Nepal so that the Maoists could serve the Indian administration for all time to come”.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

By the way, Madhav Nepal’s daughter has reportedly studied MBBS in India and that under free government scholarship. This perhaps says something.
The MBBS scholarship from India, if correct, was not in fact free Mr. Nepal to his daughter. There is no free lunch in Indian diplomacy. Is Mr. Nepal shielding India then from his side?
Listening to Mr. Nepal’s irrelevant and twisted version, Mukherjee and Shyam Saran must have received electrical shocks.
The cleverest of all among the Nepali leaders is Mr. Narayan Man Bijukche from Bhaktapur. Look how clever he is.
He signed the 12 agreement in Delhi which means that he too was in the good book of the Indian government. But why he is against the 12 point agreement now?
So he is the one who remains answerable to the Nepali people. Then we shall talk of Mr. Chitra Bahadur K.C.
And now let’s take up the arrival of Chinese State Counsellor and Minister Wang Yi.
The Chinese dignitary was here at a time when in the past two weeks his Nepali counterpart, the crane elevated Pradip Gyawali has changed his statement on Kashmir twice and let’s presume that Gyawali will once again may have told the Minister Wang that he stands to his first statement wherein he had stated that Kashmir issue was a dispute to be bilaterally resolved by India and Pakistan.
So where Nepal stands on Kashmir, the Chinese understand. However, observers fail to understand that why Chinese President is so excited to visit to Nepal when he knows better that the entire Nepali government and the ruling leaders love and honor India more than the Indian nationals but possess no sympathy for China?
China has big challenge in Nepal from Blockade master PM Modi on matters of preserving Nepal’s continued independence and sovereign status. This the Chinese must understand.
Presence of RAW agency is the biggest challenge for China in epal. 
And now Comrade Prachanda in his fresh bid to bring himself closer to the Chinese regime, has shaken the national diplomacy, if ever it had since the advent of this republican which is running under the whims of India controlled Nepal albeit in the front are Nepali nationals.
He has suddenly changed his camps and switched from US to China. The US too made a blunder by inviting him and his wife to the US for treatment without checking his left and right and his grand habit of double speak. Prachanda duped the US Ambassador on Venezuelan crisis if His Excellency the Ambassador Randy Berry recalls. How the things went in between Prachanda and the US embassy is not our business to elaborate. It was indeed their internal affair.
A political man who could not remain faithful to mother Nepal, how he could be he close to the US or for that matter China? It is here Ambassador Berry failed summarily. He is basically a Delhi’s man. If any confusion ask former US Ambassador James F Moriarty.
Since India cancelled Minister Wang Yi’s scheduled visit to Delhi and so the minister flew to Pakistan and thus chances remain slim that President Xi will visit India this October end. Minister Wang attended the trilateral conference with Pakistan, Afghanistan and China. The conference was a success.
China, high placed sources say that is not happy with the developments in the Kashmir area which as per China, India has intervened into China’s territorial integrity. If so then it could be easily understood that China and India may once again come face to face. In such a scenario as it stands today, China and Pakistan are together.
Sources say that Chinese have built several bridges in their territory which the Indian government considers to have been built inside the Indian landmass. It is this dispute which may invite 1962 “fatal battle” once again.
However, the Pakistan, China and Afghanistan trilateral conference in Islamabad went well to the satisfaction of the attending three countries.  Needless to says, this conference took place close on the heels of the abrupt cancellation of the US-Afghan Taliban peace talks. It is here that the the Pakistani role must come into action for multiple political reasons.  A Joint statement too has been issued after the conclusion of the three nations meet held in Islamabad. 




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Look the fun: Nepal’s PM Oli too met Chinese Foreign Minister in private much the similar way as he have had talked with Minister Shankar from India. What PM Oli may have talked with China’s minister puzzles the Nepali nationals because the domestic population know a bit of his personal tilt. Yet if China is happy then why should observers be unhappy?
But China’s President Xi Jinping must visit Nepal just for the Nepali people. The people love China. If China settles the Lipulek issue with Nepal then love and honor for China and its people shall scale new heights.
But will President Xi listen to Nepal’s plea? And above all, will China help Nepal in preserving its endangered national sovereignty like what Marshal Chen Yi used to assure Nepal in the good old days of Chairman Mao? If not how China is then a reliable partner of Nepal?  That’s all.

44,http://telegraphnepal.com/1299-2/,"N.P. Upadhyaya, Kathmandu: Nepali Congress parliamentarian Pradip Giri spoke of the chances that if India so desired can gulp Nepal a la Sikkim or at best make Nepal another Bhutan.
Some even claim that he was told to speak so but we are not sure whatever he said was his own “brain” or an injected statement?
Whatever it may be, let’s not discuss it in details as the “rest” we understand better.

Nepal’s Foreign Minister Pradip Kumar Gyawali, in fact a crane elevated political man, changed his statement on Kashmir once again. But yet he is a modest political creature.
Prior to the arrival of BJP card holder S. Jay Shankar in Nepal, Indian aggression on Kashmir was an issue that, he said, demanded bilateral talks between Pakistan and India and that the occupation in Kashmir by India could destabilize the South Asian region. This he has said as the SAARC Chair.
This is what he used to say which had in fact surprised many a brains in Nepal as to how he “could dare” to make a statement that went opposite to what India desired from this satellite state ( close to a protectorate).




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Mr. Shankar appears to have jolted Nepal during his Kathmandu stay hinting to await for yet another Economic Blockade and apparently for fear of losing the ‘current post’ and also for averting the blockade, “made” our foreign minister to speak while attending a meet in the Maldives that “since it was an Indian constitutional matter and thus whatever she does with the constitution should not bother us”.
Gyawali in an indirect manner admitted to the utter shame of the Nepali population that Nepal has already went to the lap of the Indian regime. There should now be no illusion in the political acumen of “nationalist” KP Sharma Oli and his ministers.
Who they are stands now exposed. But with this Nepal’s existential threat has come to the front.
But whatever our elevated Minister says of Kashmir to please India, the fact will remain a fact and the fact is that Kashmir has now taken an international dimension and the world community have been talking of the plight of the Kashmiri population beginning the black day of August 5, last month.
Beijing must have understood as to where Nepal stands and how the Nepali leaders should be taken on any international issue, for example Kashmir.
Now Nepal has also pegged its foreign policy with India’s as the Nepali currency has been tied up with the Indian currency. The next step is merger with the Indian Union? Isn’t Mr. Foreign Minister?
Shame on entire Nepali population including this scribe. Nepali people should now mourn the demise of Nepal’s Non Aligned Policy which had kept us all along “sovereign and independent”. The rest is history now.
Again back to Pradip Giri: Giri later clarified that Nepal should adopt a competitive-smart diplomacy which is equipped with the ability that allows Nepal to talk straight with the Indian side and push its grievances in a free and frank manner. (Isn’t he talking the absurd?).
Gyawali was coerced by Shankar and so he chose to change his stand on Kashmir not from the Nepali soil but pleased India by being in the Maldives.
We sympathize with our Foreign Minister. But if he has the habit of changing his statements every now and then with the change of places then let’s presume that he can once again change his statement on Kashmir if he is in Bangladesh or is back even in Nepal.
Thanks Shyam Saran for this Republican order. Grand but loaded gift you installed.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Mr. Shankar, the one who pressed Minister Gyawali hard is a highly qualified but heartless personality whose meanness we have already experienced during the last Indian blockade imposed on Nepal in the year 2015.
If taken in the light of the erratic behavior of Minister Shankar, Mr. Giri is correct but the manner he presented his saying inside the Parliament was simply frightening.
Some even took Giri’s talk as to have been a “subtle” signal from the Indian regime through NC parliamentarian Pradip Giri.
Nothing is impossible in RAW controlled Nepal, it is not only talked but strongly believed.
Needleless to say, after Giri’s bombshell, here comes the real villain of Nepal-the Indian Viceroy Manjeev Singh Puri who apart from his “micro-managing” of Nepal in earnest has begun travelling districts after districts collecting the needed and the required “information” of some Nepali political leaders perhaps with an avowal that “time permitting” which of the leaders of Nepal could be “used and overused” for securing and ensuring the security interests of the Indian establishment prior to materialize ‘the target Sikkim’.
His travel here and there could be, some say, to change the regime even.
Ambassador Puri was found asking how much popular Bhattari is. This perhaps explains the Indian design which could be in the pipeline.
RAW, says an estimate, is present even in areas where Nepal government is absent.
Only the Indian Ambassador(s) have the exclusive rights in Nepal to move freely without seeking the “required and the needed” permission from Nepal’s foreign Ministry.
Sovereign and Independent Nepal has turned into the personal fiefdom of the Indian Ambassador Manjeeb Singh Puri.
He is the undeclared ‘His majesty the King of Nepal’, as the people have begun taking him these days. Shame on all of us. Removing the real King we have brought this alien King.
Listening to the plight and the unequal treatment meted out to them by the Central Indian government, Nepal’s Gorkha soldiers apparently have approached the Nepal Government in the recent months which is why the Nepal Government has tentatively told the Indian establishment in no uncertain terms that “Let’s bring out some substantial improvement in the Nepal-India-Britain tripartite treaty that governs the Gorkha recruitment both in the former British Colony, the Indian republic and the Colonizer-today’s United Kingdom.
The Gorkhas serving in Britain too have begun demanding equal treatment at par with their British Counterparts.
While writing this story, what has come to our notice is that the Indian government in a calculated manner made null and void the Indian citizenship of those Nepali population who have been living in Assam for more than centuries.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The exodus of the Indian-Nepalese is likely to begin and they will definitely enter the country of their ancestors.
But the story doesn’t end here.
A comfortably qualified intellectual with ….bend has joined the Pradip Giri’s structured strategy if it could be taken as that.
This gentleman openly says that Nepal must trim its military strength and do not think of bringing in of a benevolent dictator.
For the record, such a statement has come to our knowledge decades and decades after but it came at a time when the nation has yet to analyze the inner meanings of what Pradip Giri meant when he said that “should India so desire, Nepal can easily turn into Sikkim.
The threat to Nepal’s existence thus is increasing from none other than from our own distinguished intellectuals. Are these Nepali nationals Nepal’s real enemies? Who knows?
I am in full knowledge and now could recall that trimming of the Nepal Army was primarily “suggested” by sitting Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai during the early nineties.
He advised the then monarch King Birendra to think upon the proposal pushed by him, read PM Bhattarai, for downsizing the military strength in Nepal.
A puzzled King, (let’s presume so) must have been traumatized internally by his Prime Minister’s somehow or the other an “anti-national” proposal.
However, the King without feeling disturbed and losing his cool composure told the Interim Prime Minister Bhattarai that, (sic) “ Look PM, I know that neither Nepal Army can fight with India nor with China for long. But yet don’t you think that the Nepal Army shall keep Nepal sovereign and independent for a few more minutes or even as long as an hour if the unexpected happens”?
A pin drop silence prevailed for few minutes in between the King and his PM. The PM got the message and he since then dropped the army trimming idea.
It was this Prime Minister who during his first visit to India signed a Nepal-India joint communique dated June 10, 1990 which was no less than a “Treaty” with India which made Nepal over dependent on India as if the Indian dependency were not enough.
So guess where the tilt lay of this Nepali Prime Minister? (RIP).
Some Nepali nationals “love and honor” India more than their own motherland. But why? Keep on guessing.
Now after decades and decades, this high flying intellectual once again has floated the same idea which had then been pushed by Nepal Congress highest functionary-Krishna Prasad Bhattarai.
Draw your own conclusions if you can and understand as to why this “slogan” of downsizing of the Nepal Army has cropped up at this critical time? What could have been the real motive? Whose instructions are being followed and why?
Yes. Nepal Army’s track record too is not that lovely. Our national Army is as many business sectors as could be handled from catering to constructions of …..
Our “once upon a time distinguished” Nepal Army is yet to try to open Saloon and Beauty parlors et al. This should not mean that we have no trust on our Army.
Though we have high regards for the Nepal Army, however, the Army’s track record is dismal after the advent of this republican order.
Nepal Army must begin soul searching.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Yes Nepal should be ready to cut the strength of its army if India, the source for Nepal threat for existence, accepts Nepal’s Zone of peace Proposal.
The ZOP pushed by Nepal King Birendra was to keep Nepal free from the Indian threat. India did not recognize Nepal’s Zone of Peace proposal though some hundred sixteen countries have had endorsed the Nepali proposal including the US under President Ronald Reagan.
India’s summary denial means that Nepal’s existential threat remains intact and that too from the fascist India which has very freshly annexed Kashmir-an internationally recognized disputed territory awaiting UN plebiscite.
If India guarantees Nepal’s continued existence as a sovereign nation (keeping some powerful countries as guarantors) then Nepal would be ready to cut down the size of its almost “redundant” army which has, thanks, kept itself engaged in a joint drill with the Chinese Army as of now.
All in all, Nepal is being encircled by enemies, some paid and some working voluntary perhaps. But who shall work for free in these hard times?
No wonder then one Indian retired RAW functionary has asserted that “we in the RAW dismantled the Nepali monarchy and facilitated the entrance of the Republican order in Nepal by convincing Comrade Prachanda”.
But yet our political animals claim that they were instrumental in the advent of the Republican order. Is this Bihari national Amar Bhusan, the author of the book “Inside Nepal” is correct or what our politicians bark is the reality? The RAW gentleman should have also mentioned as to who the media men were who helped the RAW initiative then in lieu of hefty Indian currency? He however, kept it a secret for reasons that could be understood…
Now when the RAW admits then what remains to be told?
However, the RAW officials’ version of overthrowing Nepal’s monarchy with the tacit assistance of the Delhi residing Comrade Prachanda is being given a twist and being termed as a “fiction”.
Why is this bending of the fact? No wonder it so happens in Nepal. That’s all.",/national,"Thu, 05 Sep 2019 19:36:30 +0000"

University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Louisiana, USA
Almost 68% of Nepal’s nearly 29 million people depend on agriculture for livelihoods. Nepalese agriculture contributes about 33% to national GDP. The National Sample Census of Agriculture 2011/12 showed a total of 3,715,555 households engaged in crop production (having > 0.01 ha land) and 115,538 households engaged in the production of livestock only (having < 0.01 ha land) in Nepal. About 90% of agricultural land is devoted to the production of cereal crops and remaining 10% under cash crops; and, the Terai, Hills, and Mountain regions contain, respectively, 70%, 26% and 4% of total agricultural land.
Nepal’s agricultural productivity is at a very low level. In order to increase agricultural productivity, timely availability of improved seeds and other agricultural inputs, access to sustainable technologies and practices, and presence of required infrastructure for agricultural development is necessary. Conversion of agricultural lands to other uses is another major problem in Nepal. In 2015, total agricultural land area dropped to 4,228,548 hectare, which was less than 142,262 hectare as compared to 2001. Widespread degradation of agricultural lands due to soil erosion, compaction, depletion of plant nutrients, acidification, soil pollution, destruction of soil structure, loss of soil carbon, and decline on soil biodiversity is another major concern. Land degradation is also occurring due to landslides, debris flow and deposition, sedimentation, river cutting, overgrazing, and deforestation.
Nepal’s agricultural trade indicators over the past four decades show a very alarming trend. Nepal had an agricultural trade balance of US $14.3 million in 1979-80 which turned into a negative agricultural trade balance of US $151.6 million in 2002, and an import of agricultural goods worth over US $2 billion in the 2017-2018 fiscal year. There is a widespread concern among local communities, national media, farmers, agriculturists, intellectuals, policy makers, and other stakeholders in relation to increasing agricultural imports, food safety and security, agricultural unemployment, outmigration of farming communities, land abandonment, and the conversion of agricultural lands in the country.

About a decade ago, I published a groundbreaking framework of Asta-Ja meaning eight Ja in Nepali letter, Jal (water), Jamin (land), Jungle (forest), Jadibuti (medicinal and aromatic plants), Janshakti (manpower), Janawar (animal), Jarajuri (crop plants) and Jalabayu (climate) as fundamental resources for economic development and socio-economic transformation in Nepal. This publication has been followed by a series of other publications on Asta-Ja Framework, which include, policy framework, strategic framework, capacity building framework, management of Asta-Ja system and the focus of Asta-Ja on national planning and development. Asta-Ja Framework suggests “Jalabayu” as the driving force for all other elements (Jal, Jamin, Jungle, Jadibuti, Janashakti, Janawar, and Jarajuri) and require full consideration of all eight elements while utilizing Asta-Ja resources for economic development. For example, for sustainable crop production (i.e. Jarajuri), all other seven Jas must be well utilized, conserved and developed. In other words, no sustainable crop production is possible without conservation of land, forest, water, availability of appropriate Janashakti, and adequate consideration of Jalabayu. Medicinal and aromatic plants could be incorporated in agricultural system. The eight principles of Asta-Ja Framework: community awareness, capacity-building, policy decision making, comprehensive assessment, interrelationships and linkages, sustainable technology and practices; institutions, trade and governance, and sustainable socio-economic transformation and community development provide practical guidelines for design and successful implementation of policies and programs relating to Asta-Ja resources at the grassroots level.
Asta-Ja Framework along with Michael E. Porter’s Four-diamond model can guide us in developing agriculture as a vibrant and sustainable enterprise. Competitive price and product differentiation are critical elements for national competitiveness according to Porter’s model. Nepalese agricultural produce should be cheaper than foreign produce and there should be clear differentiation between Nepalese agricultural produce and the foreign ones. Nepal has competitive advantage on organic agriculture. High hills in Nepal are best suited for off-season/in season fruits and vegetables, vegetable seeds, and other high-value agriculture. Smallholder farming coupled with favorable agroecological conditions put Nepal in exceptionally advantageous situation for organic agriculture. Organic production will increase the competitiveness of Nepalese agriculture especially fruits and vegetables, dairy, poultry, pigs, goats, spices, and fish. For cereals, an increase on agricultural productivity could be the short-term goal, while organic cereal production could be the long-term goal.
Nepalese agriculture could be very competitive internationally if handled correctly. There are five drivers of agricultural development in Nepal.
They are: 

Smallholder mixed farming system,
Incentives,
Pro-poor market,
Infrastructure, and
Policies and programs.

These five drivers of agricultural development must the focal points while designing agricultural development strategies and programs in Nepal. Just like the Dutch are implementing “Circular Agriculture” to enhance sustainability of their farms and agriculture, Nepal must promote mixed-farming system for sustainable agriculture and competitiveness. Negative aspect of open border especially in agriculture is a major challenge for development. Obviously, various policy measures including strict border control and restrictions, product certification, eco-labeling, and community awareness would be necessary.
The cooperative movement has become the top national agenda of the Government of Nepal since the 1950s. Currently, a total number of 34,512, with a total membership number of 6,305,581 operate in Nepal. These include: savings and credit (13,578), multipurpose (4,371), agriculture (10,921), milk (1,658), consumer (1,423), fruits and vegetables (193), tea (108), coffee (155), Jadibuti (184), bee keeping (93), communication (143), health (128), sugarcane (48), Junar (45), and other coops (999). Agricultural cooperatives can take part in production agriculture at the local level. They can also take part on local level agri- marketing (input supplies, output collection, small-scale processing/packaging). Price guarantees and support, crop and livestock insurance, value-chain, branding, capacity-building, and farm machinery would be some of the key areas that cooperatives need help from the government.
Supply chain management always has been a major challenge for efficient production and marketing of agricultural commodities. Many farmers are struggling for better prices for their produce, governmental support, and marketing of their commodities. On the other hand, the rising urban population is resulting in increasing demand for food and other commodities. Small cooperatives formed in rural areas are not capable of undertaking bigger roles in processing, packaging, storage, and marketing of agricultural products primarily due to their limitations on capital and human resources, smaller volume of produce, lack of knowledge, and lack of necessary infrastructures. Therefore, regional and national marketing initiatives need to be undertaken by corporate or private businesses, corporations, or other joint venture entities who can invest in the necessary logistics, transportation, storage, and human resources. This brings an opportunity for vertical integration of cooperatives with corporate or private businesses, corporations, and similar other companies in the agricultural supply chain.

Nepalese diaspora can contribute to agricultural development through joint ventures together with Nepal’s financing agencies and local investors on agribusinesses. They can invest on a wide spectrum of agro-industries, value addition, water harnessing, irrigation, agri-tourism, laboratory facilities, and local business. Nepalese diaspora keep high potential for small, medium, or even large investment. Appropriate policies, rules, and regulations and possibly some incentives should be in place in order to attract private investments from Nepalese diaspora.

Back then to the era of 1950s, the time the tradition of presenting annual budgets promulgated in Nepal, many things are rolling-over the roads leading to fiscal accounts, government expenditure and earnings. They, since then, showed many hopes and beliefs that the country is marching towards the prosperity, by then, unfortunately rooted towards prosperity of “Family-regimes” -the RANAs, “Royal Diasporas” and continuing then-after to the so-called “democrats” and “revolutionary icons”. The flame illuminating the hopes for the prosperity never extinguished, nonetheless, people started thinking “are we just sitting below the lights, and because of that we are not feeling any brightness” (in Nepali, batti muni adhyaaro”), or, we are mis-guided, cheated, and brushed with chants and slogans of populist words/theories. It’s our duty to identify the real cause and suggest accordingly to the concerned authorities.
Now, let’s move to the philosophy of economics.
“Classical free trade” philosophy started in the 18th century- hats off to the wishful thoughts of Adam Smith. The era of 1970s, the time world started to play the economic orchestra and served for the process of economic liberalization, privatization and globalization. In fact, is started to boom the fiscal properties, and bringing ideas for reaching alchemy of economic development. After the cessation of the Second World War, numerous appreciative opportunities, such as breakthrough of economic discourses and innovations started to make “resilient economic practices”. Emphasis were also started to strengthen the diplomatic relations among nations for economic liberation(s) and paradigm shifts for a prosperous and sustained economic growth. As a result European countries and United States of America were able to trigger the pace of the economic and social developments at their own level. In spite of these, anomalies in economic and social theories may exist in different countries, as per their strategies to address the public necessities.
Now, let us go back to local level from the global euphoria of economics. I wrote similar, more-or less-same thing before (June 2015), and now trying to give a flash back and mapping if I can provide answers to some questions that were raised by then. The fundamental question: what we achieve -in terms of economic development, social development, and many other cultural developments so far, in the country? I concluded, “We- all are confused, every pennies/rupees of the country’s economy are confused”. The “Confusion” is- we have claimed that we are marching towards “socialist economy” (please refrain the definition from any political theory). Here, “socialist economy” is used to represent the proper/democratic distribution of resources to people and provide economic opportunities to people. “Socialist economy” for enhancing the pillars of basic needs of the people, such as in the education, health and so on.
Author: Ranjan Parajuli, PhD
Like in 2015, again I started wondering what should be the point of penetration that I need to make to cover the above global and local socio-economic foundations, and check if we achieved anything. Records of December 2018 showed the annual GDP growth rate of 7.1% (in 2014, was 6%) – good, but trade deficit averaged to -307 million USD (from 2001-2018). The economy, which is heavily supported by remittances (as of 2019, this amounts to about 22-25% of GDP), is fragile.
The fragility is due to growing failures in improving diplomatic gestures and relations; increasing dominance of “sick vendors” in transacting labour across the border; increasing ’interest of cutting down foreign labors” in many countries, and lots of insecurities labors are facing till date. Agriculture, one of the important tools to ensure “sovereignty”, is degrading-despite majority of the population are believed to be pursuing agrarian business, its contribution to GDP is one-third. There are some positive indicators such, as gross national savings (33.94% of GDP in 2015) was slightly above the word average; investment was (28.94% of GDP). Meanwhile, unemployment rate hovers high, around 50%. It does not mean that there are no any hopes for improvement, there are, but the threats prevail- if growth of economic indicators can be sustained. The only way to sustain is- how we a make the cash flow more vibrant, how we utilize the capitals for oscillating the financial flows for increasing the benefits and enhance the financial liquidity. The next question then arise is- will these be able to support “socialist-economy” as defined above?

World Bank said that Nepal has acquired attractive progress over the last few years by being able to reduce the population living on less than $1.25 by half compared to the situation seven years back, i.e. from 53% to 25% between 2003 and 2011. Furthermore, one of the recent studies of Asian Development Bank (ADB) also stressed that the thresholds of $1.25 per day might not be the measure to accommodate the extent of extreme poverty in the region, for instance, it is also essential to integrate the repercussions of factors such as the cost of consumption specific to Asia’s poor; spurs in the food costs and vulnerability to natural disasters, climate change, economic crises, and other shocks to the economy. There are also claims that the social indicators e.g. education, health and gender mainstreaming are also in progress. Appreciating these progresses, now the next question is how to utilize these social capitals to transform the physical capitals into financial capitals and have the return in the same order or alike. I started wondering again, “what would be the primarily pre-requisites for such transformations?” are these progresses enough to make an equal pace with other adjoining Asian countries, at least?” Are all these revealing the fact, even though there are some positive figures, but insignificant to increase the welfare to the population, insufficient to make the economic system more resilient? For example, consumption stood at 76% of the GDP (for 2016-2017), which is the main growth driver, but how sustainable it is (since it is mainly rooted due to increasing remittance)? The question will exist, at least, until and unless a clear strategy to define “foreign employment” and balance of “local labour forces” are not in place.
The distribution of economy should be rooted with the earnings. For this, I have a simple sentence, if I have money in my pocket, or if I have capacity to put money in my pocket then I owe the capacity to purchase goods in the market.
Here, “I” mean “country”, “money = economy” “purchase goods= social welfare provision costs”. Then, what are the pre-requisite tools to support this? Of course, again the “economy”: “balance of payment”, “public spending”, “and private spending” and the nexus among them. The budget balance (% of GDP) for the year 2017 was -3.3% (expected to be -4.6% of the GDP). Later back few years, the average share of exports to the GDP between 1996 -2013 was 21.7% (i.e. this proportion is running out of the GDP) and for the same period the import share was 8.7% of the GDP, at 2014 price. The government expenditures of the country for 2014 was 19.2% of the GDP, the Economy Watch revealed it. The overall balance for the year 2013 was 5.2% of the GDP. Until and unless, proper utilization of the resources is not made, it would be just myth “welfare based economic development”. Should I say “distributive economy” if I cannot put ample of money in the basket and pulling out more than I have on it. Rest assured, the government of Nepal, and the financial “kingpins”.
Then, I felt to jump back with the same obvious claims- “the major challenge to the country’s economy is its inability to integrate the domestic economic system/sub-systems with the regional and global economies and upscale the benefits of the globalization”. A clear example is that how and in what extent we have been able to practice our economic diplomacy with the north and south corridors of the future uprising economies; are we utilizing the benefits of our strategic locations of residing on such geo-political plates where two points of economic corridors China and India are growing? In one of the study it is further stressed that among all of our constraints to upscale the economic growth, the weak “economic diplomacy” has been a vital component particularly after the 1990s. The questions thus arise from these are:
(i) What sort of policies and regulations did we and should we now have to make for the advancement in the production system, transformation and exchange of goods and services among other countries,
(ii) What was our basis of exchanging the labour forces in different corners of world,
(iii) What kind of economic and political negotiations we made to ensure the sustained and healthy working environment of Nepalese people working in different stressful areas, and if did nothing remarkable what we should do now
(iv) What are our national norms and guidelines to increase the foreign investments, etc. These are the food for thoughts at the political level, I wish some of them have been practiced, internalized, integrated, and or, if not, whether will be made in the near future by our political mainstreams?

Borrowing ‘theory of relativity’ here, “the physical laws have to be recognized and comparability should be made, as a basis to measure and move for progress ahead”. A quick snapshot analysis among our peers. Economic performance of Nepal is painfully lacking behind from last three decades while other South Asian economies were enjoying the growth in some of the economic indicators. If per capita growth is regarded as an indicator then the country’s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) have been the lowest in the region. As of the statistics published by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in April 2015, it was argued that with the price of 2014, the per capita GDP of Nepal was estimated at around $2200-$2300 compared with $2900-$3000 for Bangladesh, $4600-$4700 for Pakistan, $5400-$5800 for India, $9700-$10,000 for Sri Lanka, Bhutan $7400-$7600, and $11,000-12,000 for Maldives. In terms of per capita GDP, as of last decade and in the price of the year 2000, the status of per capita GDP of Nepal in 2007 was the status of Sri Lanka which was in 1960, Pakistan in 1970, and India and Bhutan in 1980. So what went wrong? Some probable answers to this could be:
(i) Lack of diplomatic integrations in the economic reformations and weakening after 1990s,
(ii) Political and economic insurgency because of the so-called “peoples’ war for a decade of 1996-2006, halting all the accessibilities to social and economic structures,
(iii) Ill-considerations in the economic and financial disbursements in the periodic development plans and inability to rationally utilize huge chunk of allocated money etc.
So, where and how we headed up to here (this pulse of time)?
A unique “capacity enigma” is inherent with our economic situations, i.e. it has always enough capacity to collect revenues and allocate budgets to invest in the basic infrastructures, but never succeed to spend its funds, especially the capital budget. For instance, in one of the news it was reported that the average capital expenditure absorption rate (the difference between planned and actual capital expenditure) was about 71 percent in the last decade. So, here is the barrier to economic development, as if capital budgets are put in a “brown sack” and placed in a ditch and buried. So can we expect anything, such like growth is going to happen from such ill-plans and implementation modalities? I think the only thing that may happen with this is that it will rotten the balance of payment, purchasing power capacity and so on. So, it is the necessity of the government’s administrative system to fix the problems related to such fragile efficiency of utilizing the capital budgets. We are entreating foreign aids and loans every year, but never cashed-them in an objective manner’. The scenarios that showed the unfortunate situations where we were unable to spend the amount should justify the fact. Foreign aid accounts for 22% of the government budget and half of government’s capital expenditure.
We often claim that accessibility, affordability and availability of goods and services are the key drivers of development, and most importantly for the sustainable access to development carriers and their use. Per capita electricity consumption of Nepal is far below than other adjoining south Asian countries, (134 kWh, as of 2014), road density (108 km per 100 sq. k land, as of 2000, which is indeed not much increased so far), irrigated land (28% of the total agricultural land, as of 2014), GDP per unit of energy use (5.78 in constant 2011 PPP dollars), whereas other South Asian countries has progressed in a multi-fold scale compared to our country. I am sure that no remarkable changes are made in the improvement of such status, as in the past decades we have been doing nothing, but uttering a lot on never-ending political deadlocks and just manifesting the development budgets with no any real meaning of providing tangible returns to public and entrepreneurs. Hence, provisions of significant services to public are with nothing new flavours added; so, then what happened to the allocation of budgets and their disbursement modalities? Financial returns from such attitudes can thus never gain a capacity for reshaping the socio-economic status of the population. Have we ever realized the budgetary plans really addressing such issues and have we ever felt this at the implementation level? I am not sure, whether it has. ! If anyone felt these, I would be happy to learn.

We can see tremendous opportunities to repair economic systems and make our spending rationale in some distinct clusters (improvement of public service, social securities, financial securities and soft loans to small and medium entrepreneurs etc.); to maintain the surplus and manage the prevailing deficits in the fiscal budgets. Higher capital spending is required to build physical infrastructures, to increase the road density, increasing the effective energy intensity, health and social services. If the country cannot make the spending, then it can at least allocate the unspent funds as in the form of special development investment packages, clearly highlighting the economic sectors that can be considered periodically to have chance to utilize them, wherever relevant. For instance, it can allocate special public investment funds to upscale the cottage industries, trade and business, in addition to the normal planned budgets and to increase the quality and quantity of services. Having money in the ”ditch” can never be smarter than disbursing them to the public and private entrepreneurs in a planned and definite regulated manner, providing the potential beneficiaries of such funds subsidized interest rates, so that it can maintain the momentum of cash flows in an economy. These are the ways of putting money to “my pocket” so that I owe capacity to “distribute”. Is this happening? May be the provision of “come crores of national earnings directly to parliamentarians” can do- should people believe, No not at all. PM Oli and the peers, I am afraid-is this your theory for leading towards “socialist-economy”?
It has been said that despite of poor and ineffective management of financial flows in the agriculture system, it has always been able to support the balance of payment of the country trying for bringing to the positive sides, particularly because of the earnings from the export commodities, especially to India. For instance, although GDP registered an impressive 5.6% growth in 2007/08 compared with 3.0% in 2006/07, the surge was largely due to timely rains leading to a good harvest of main agricultural crops and to a rise in tourist arrivals, and not due to major improvements in economic fundamental foundations. So, should we always depend on such natural gifts and always remain happy saying “we have them” or make a corridor where the economic tram can be guided, operated and controlled and rationally use them. Please be assured the planners the drivers sitting over the economic wings of my country. Despite such realizations, it was never treated rationally with effective monetary tools, whether subsidising on the upfront capital cost that are required for their sustained growth. If the problem is capital budget, we have enough un-spent. I agree that there could be some legislative and conflict of interests in the disbursement of such funds, but the government can promulgate laws stating, “in the cases of country political and administrative system unable to make sufficient public spending the remaining chunk of funds can be utilized in development activities in agreed proportions”. Budget is a tangible quantity, it can be measured and thus it should be able to say, the taxed amount shall be utilized in such a manner so that the discouraged products would create market for sustained and qualitative products which make displacements in the conventional market. For instance, if it says, “we will increase the import tax to petrol” then it should also say that “while doing so we will encourage our beneficiaries to use renewable sources and the government can assist financially by this much of amount while doing so”. Necessary discourse can be initiated and can also plan the budget realizing the capacity that we owe. It should be embodied with required funds and plans of financial disbursement. Having such, then the un-spent capital budgets can be used proportionately in the agreed and prioritized activities. The sector can be periodically prioritized and assisted. There could be other options as well. I can see the roads paving towards the “social welfare enhanced economy”, ways leading for “enhancing the guts of the poor”. Do you see, Ministry of Finance, and other allied wings to upgrade rural employment and economy of the country?
Now the country has drafted the constitutions and aided regulations/laws, thus it is the right time to look back and think ahead-what can be done, and what we are doing right now. The country has “majority ruled” government and found “full-fledge” government running for 5-years after many decades. The politicians and government officials, especially leaders are uttering many welfare-oriented doors. Nevertheless, to ensure and strengthen the claims, harmonisation and consistency among the political class, institutions, and the bureaucratic systems are needed, which is indeed “flowing down with river streams” with no benefits. It should be the time to revise the economic policy of the country and to be assured that the economic system can facilitate to narrow the gap between poor and rich; increase the social securities in the form of improving the access to basic pre-requisites for the advancements of the social capital of the country. The constitution has the same “belief” and “the direction”, isn’t it?

Taxation policies, their allocation and management as such should be formulated ensuring their utilization for enhancing the physical capitals of the country. National consumption is the value of goods and services bought by people, where individual buying would act to aggregate the financial flows over time and space. Hence, consumption is normally the largest GDP component, and its level and dynamics can be treated as one of the strong indicator to judge the economic performance of a country. The fiscal policies of our country thus should also put forward how the national consumption can be up-scaled, identify the barriers in the path, and then delineate necessary provisions to guarantee the fixation of problems in the next fiscal budgetary years. I hope leaders, planners, bankers and administrative mechanism knows how to look on such prospects. I am not an expert on such.
So, is the cloud roaring above the cabinet house, uttering, “Provision of social welfare-based economy” and “leading for socialist-economy” is really a myth, disguise or felicity? Rest assured our financial hubs.

Put simply, security is a physical, mental, and psychological feelings, relative to time, space, environment, and consciousness levels of the people concerned. As, nothing in life, especially at the micro level, is more or less unrelated to security, misunderstanding arises regarding the meaning of security, at times. When talking about security, therefore, answers to three basic questions/ variables – security for/ of what (e.g. human right? religious minority? marginalized groups?), security from what (challenges/ threats such as violence? poverty? drug-trafficking? human right abuse?), and security with what (means and instruments) need to be made clear.
National Security and National Security Strategy: 
In layman’s terms, National security implies security and protection of national interests from the internal and external threats/ challenges. And how a nation-state secures, maintains, and promotes its national interests in the context of existing threats and challenges is what is termed as National Security Strategy (NSS).
NSS is also defined as the art and science of developing and using the instruments of national power in peace or war to secure national objectives capitalizing on the nation’s sources of power.
To formulate a sound NSS, a nation needs to invariably identify certain constants/ variables which include:

National vital interests/ objectives,
Threats/ challenges to these national interests,
Available sources and instruments of national power, and
Ways to effectively employ the instruments of national power to secure national interests.

NSS is the foundation stone for all other national strategies including economic, social, and political. NSS needs to be regularly updated for timely course correction as required by new technology and changes in national and international security environments.

Over the past two centuries, Nepal could not have a balanced security strategy/ policy mainly because the Nepalese rulers equated and maintained their family, clan, and regime interests as national interests. It was because of such self-serving security thinking that Nepal suffered a strategic defeat in Nepal-East India Company war (1814-1816 A. D.), and was condemned to survive as a semi-colonial nation-state throughout the Rana regime. Even after the Rana regime, Nepal’s territorial integrity and sovereignty repeatedly suffered owing to wrong definition of national interests.
Nepal’s growth as a free, independent, and a sovereign nation-state in future is, therefore, contingent on its capability to establish and pursue a practical and balanced security strategy/ policy that realistically takes into account Nepal’s true national interests and unique geo-political location. For this, first and foremost, Nepal needs to correctly identify its national purpose and vital interests.
Background: In South Asia, some of the latest examples of major external threats to national interests that the small nations experienced are: Indo-Pakistan war (1972 A. D.) resulting in the birth of Bangladesh; merger in 1975 A. D. of Sikkim into India; and deployment of Indian troops to Sri Lanka in 1987 A. D. and to Maldives in 1988 A. D. The latest major natural disaster which some of the South Asian states (India, Sri Lanka) also faced was the devastating Tsunami of 2003 A. D.
The major external challenges to national interests modern Nepal confronted in the past include: 
The Chinese invasion (1792 A. D.), in which the Chinese troops marched right up to Betrawati river and threatened Kathmandu itself; the war of 1814-1816 A. D., in which Nepal lost major portion of its territory; and the Indian ‘blockade’ (?) in 1989-1990 A. D. Moreover, Nepal faced a decade long Maoist insurgency as a major threats, inviting political instability and foreign power interferences. Besides, Nepal suffered number of major natural and manmade disasters, the most devastating of which were the earthquake of 1934 A. D., and Koshi river dam outburst (2008 A. D).
Sources of threats to national interests, thus, could be Natural (ecological) and manmade, external (state and non-state actors / powers), or internal agencies. However, to-date several other challenges also pose grave threats to national interests. For Nepal, those challenges could be natural/ manmade, military, psychological, political, economic, social, demographic, cultural, religious, subversion, infiltration, and espionage.
Nepal’s Crucial Strategic Vulnerabilities: 
Nepal is sandwiched between India and China, which are respectively 22 and 75 times bigger in size than Nepal. While Nepal’s population is approximately 27 million, each of its neighbors, has well over one billion mark. The nearest access to the sea is the Bay of Bengal, which is 1127 km spanning the territory of India. Nepal maintains negligent direct land routes to countries other than India. Nepal remains not only land-locked, but also practically ‘India-locked’. The supply routes for Nepal’s survival are, thus, insecure, and its economy remains most vulnerable. Moreover, one school of thought maintains the possibility of grand strategic bargaining involving the disputed territories (Aksai Chin and Arunanchal Pradesh), Tibet, and the existence of Nepal as a sovereign nation.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

India is Nepal’s sole external market for hydropower and water export, implying that Nepal cannot enjoy much leeway in developing its water resources.
Moreover, Nepal is bound by the unfavorable strategic treaties including:

Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950 and
Major river treaties including

Koshi- 1954,
Gandak- 1959, and
Mahakali-1996



The Indo-Nepal international border is open (devoid of natural barriers) and unsecured, rendering the Terai belt (Nepal’s economic and political core area without any natural defense) vulnerable to several types of threats military, economic, demographic, political, psychological, smuggling, and humans and drugs trafficking.
Nepal lacks strategic depth. Its economy is very weak and primitive agriculture-based. And the impact of global warming on Himalayas, which are subject to avalanches and glacial lake outbursts because of global warming, could be catastrophic for Nepal (and South Asia and world).
Nepal, at the moment, lacks centripetal force to strongly hold the nation-state together. National unity is deteriorating. Nepal’s large numbers of political parties are vulnerable to manipulation of internal and external forces. Nepal suffers identity crisis and continuous cultural invasion. While Nepal suffers from the crisis of national leaderships and lack of national consensus on vital national issues, various ethnic and regional groups are demanding for separate states.
Threats to Nepal’s Vital Interests-External:
For Nepal, the most obvious external threats as well as opportunities could be its immediate neighbors India or China, either of which is very much capable of militarily invading and occupying Nepal within a short span of time. However, Nepal is most unlikely to face such a direct foreign military invasion because of its geopolitical location, the short-term and long-term implications of such invasion, and the elements of uncertainties involved in such an adventure. Moreover, if the foreign powers, especially Nepal’s immediate neighbors, seriously want, they may achieve their ends more easily and economically by means and ways other than direct military intervention.
India and China already are water stressed economies. Water is becoming a key security issue in Sino-Indian relations and a potential source of enduring discord, which will not spare Nepal. Other external threats could include: economic blockade and energy crisis; encroachment of international border; construction of series of unilateral embankments close to ‘No man’s land’; grand design promoting ‘Akhanda Bharat’; sustained cultural invasion; infiltration of Nepalese leaderships, bureaucracy and security organs; manipulation of mainstream and regional political parties for the control of the government; armament race or major wars/ conflicts (including nuclear) in South Asia; unilateral damming, diversion, and interlinking of international rivers; regional and international instability; mass migration of people caused by the impact of ecological disaster in South Asia; and international terrorism.
Threats to Nepal’s Vital Interests – External/ Internal:
External forces are more likely to exploit internal sources to further their interests, which are camouflaged in different terms and conditions. Some of such most likely threats are: sustained political instability caused by fractious political parties and self-serving political leaderships working under foreign influence; external manipulation of Nepal’s new Constitution writing process; Nepal government’s disregard and indifference to the border encroachment; ‘hyper-dependence’ on India; illegal trafficking in humans, synthetic drugs, narcotics, counterfeits, and small arms and explosives; money laundering, organized crime, and cross-border ethnic violence; short-sighted treaties and agreements that could be made in future; activities promoting to ‘Greater Nepal’; control of Nepalese media from abroad; uncontrolled and hostile activities of INGOs within; religious and ideological fundamentalism/ extremism; and, endemic transcendental diseases like HIV/AIDS.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Threats to Nepal’s Vital Interests – Internal:
Some of the major internal challenges to national vital interests/ objectives include: crisis of national leaderships enjoying trust and confidence of all Nepalese; lack of consensus among the major political parties on what constitutes national purpose and vital interests; doubt over the credibility of the CA for writing of new Constitution on time; partisan politics prevailing over vital issues such as national political system, federation of Nepal, integration and rehabilitation of Maoist combatants, the questions of identity politics raised by ethnic and regional groups; declining national unity and centripetal force; politicization of national institutions including judiciary, educations, bureaucracy, and security forces; ill/ myopic management of Nepal’s vital resources ‘water’ and geopolitical/ geo-strategic location; very low economic growth rate; widening socio-economic disparity between the haves and haves not; and, the possibility of economic meltdown.
Other internal challenges to national interests are:
Increasing number of armed groups; massive corruption, increasing culture of violence, crime, and disregard for law and order, and criminalization of politics; controversial citizenship issue; underdeveloped civil-military relation; regional, ethnic and class differences, social discrimination, insecurity of marginalized groups; brain drain of population; centrifugal force gaining ground; rising violence leading to internal displacement of people; and, over population.
Most Dangerous Threat to Nepal’s Vital Interests: 
The most dangerous security threat to Nepal may come from internal cultural conflicts including:

Inter-religious -Hindus versus others like Muslim, Christians
Inter-ethnic/ Racial- Khas/ Mongols, Madhises versus Tharus, and
Inter-regional- Pahades versus Madhises

Such cultural sort of conflicts are most likely to trigger chain reaction across the nation-state and invite regional and international interference.
If the ongoing situation of political instability and lawlessness carries on infinitely, Nepal is bound to face the destiny of a ‘failed state’, which certainly invites foreign intervention.
Due to open/ unsecured border, Terai with almost 50% of the total population and serving as economic and political core, remains very vulnerable to several types of threats. The self-serving leaderships holding the reigns of national power could be equally dangerous to vital national interests. Moreover, the worst outcome of an unwise federation of Nepal could be the disintegration and ultimately disappearance of sovereign Nepal from world map.

Annette Baker Fox in her classic work The Power of Small States, Diplomacy in World War II, wrote The distinctive power of great states flows from their military strength For the Small state, diplomacy is the tool of statecraft. Historically foreign policy has been a vital tool of Nepali statecraft and test of statesmanship. The nature of politics which is witnessing fundamental changes in the entire spectrum of issues/interests, institutions and actors in a crucial time (21st Century) and location (in Asia between India and China) makes Nepal’s foreign policy formulation and conduct of diplomacy particularly challenging now. Dealing with simultaneously cooperating and competing regional and global super-powers embroiled in their own internal upheavals in a rapidly changing global political and economic order and strategic equation demands access to right information and ability to interpret it with knowledge, understanding and experience. Historical intricacies and new complexities seen through the eyes of simple convictions, outdated dogmas or vested interests distort comprehension; policies based on them can lead to unintended serious consequences. In Hypotheses on Misperception, Robert Jervis rightly points out perceptions, when they deteriorate into misperceptions, can create havoc. To avoid such misperceptions creating further havoc, the following constitute the major issues of foreign policy as instrument of securing Nepal’s national interests.
Relations of Trust and Confidence with India and China: 
Historically Nepal is the meeting point of two great civilizations and today it is one of the epicenters of competing interests in an impending global paradigm shift. Located between two global economic and strategic powerhouses, Nepal can greatly benefit from developments taking place in India and China today. However, it is essential to realize that proximity adds vitality but also sensitivity and complexity in interstate relations demanding high priority and careful handling. As late Prof. Yadu Nath Khanal, the most respected Nepali diplomat scholar wrote long ago our foreign policy will breakdown at the point where either India or China looses faith in us and concludes that her vital national interests and sensitivities do not receive proper recognition in our conduct of relations. Changing global and regional political, economic and security needs and the seriousness of the challenges faced by the South Asian states, particularly extreme poverty and threats from terror networks have made things more complicated.

Time and space have created unlimited potential for aid, trade, tourism, investment, technology and employment. But everything depends on the ability to put our own house in order, restore peace and rule of law, produce exportable goods and services and build relationships of trust and confidence with both our neighbors. Post-1990 Nepali politics could neither forge consensus on national interest nor strengthen institutions and empower individuals of caliber in foreign policy with whom our international partners, particularly two neighbors felt they could talk in confidence. Internal bickering and external interests undermined institutions, undercut rather than support and promote people with potential. After takeover, royalists completely misjudged domestic politics and foreign policy. So, not only did post-1990 order crumble, whole old Nepal collapsed.
Republican Nepal faces the same challenges, only worsened by political turmoil, past rhetoric and current summersaults of parties and people in power. In this age of unprecedented remote viewing and listening saying something here something else there or saying one thing but doing another only expose politics and diplomacy to crisis of credibility and confidence. Credibility and confidence deficits seriously affect Nepal’s national politics and international relations, particularly with the two neighbors. So, one of them feels the need to (volunteer?) We will help to protect Nepal’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity while the other feels so exposed that it feels compelled to apply its own ‘Monroe doctrine’. In this sensitive relationship, vain debates, name-calling and finger pointing only raise risks of more external involvement in internal power contests. So, domestic politics is the biggest problem of Nepal’s foreign policy today; restoration of trust and confidence with all our foreign friends and partners, but most importantly India and China is the top priority of Nepal’s foreign policy making and conduct of diplomacy.
Even before recent concerns that Myanmar may be seeking to develop nuclear weapons South Asia in general and Nepal in particular has been the most nuclear-locked region and nation in the world. South Asia has been described as the most dangerous place on earth. Some thinkers have since long talked and written about the possibility of Nepal becoming one of the central fronts in the global war of ideas.
Now some well informed Nepali analysts have started raising the possibility of Nepal becoming a ‘Kuruchhetra’ battlefield. A well known Indian defense specialist has gone so far as to predict a war between India and China before 2012. Both Indian and Chinese media and local language websites portraying each other as the main sources of threat only flare up the underlying tension. Officials on both sides are trying to manage the effects of such media hype. Both sides realize the importance of their growing trade and economic relations. Conflict between them will make their respective dreams of the Asian Century difficult to realize. But for those indifferent to the sufferings of others, who use violence as instruments of politics, economics, religion or tradition and thrive on conflict and chaos what would be a bigger prize than a war between two Asian giants with largest populations and armies, fastest growing economies with huge reserves to spend on arms?

On normal circumstances these views could have been overlooked as provocative propaganda. But considering the post-Cold War global paradigm-flux, the on-going turmoil, extra-regional interest/involvement in South Asia and Nepal’s own painful and traumatic experiences these views need to be examined much more carefully. The central Himalayas may be emerging as one of the epicenters of the impending global paradigm shift. Nepal needs a vigorous diplomacy of confidence building and cooperation to prevent escalation of tensions in our vicinity and certainly make sure no one tries to play one neighbor against the other but instead try to do whatever we can to promote friendly relations between them.
India’s pre-eminent position in South Asia and its economic growth potential will further enhance its standing as an emerging global power. China with its economic and military capability and as a global power is also an observer of SAARC. The informal avenues provided by the SAARC summits could be useful venues for a confidence building measure for peace and stability in the Trans- Himalayan Asia.
Tibet looms large in China-South Asia relations. The Presence of the Dalai Lama and large number of Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal cannot be wished away. The advocates of traditional Tibetan cause may see the present Dalai Lama as their last best hope whose departure from the scene would greatly weaken their cause. Thus Dalai Lama’s age and health could exert pressure on the supporters of Tibetan cause to intensify their campaign, perhaps around some of the anniversaries as they did before the Beijing Olympics. China may succeed to get Nepal to clamp down harder on the Tibetan refugees but preventing unrest within or the outflow from Tibet will depend on China itself. As a large power India can exercise its options. But, given the centrality of Tibet in Nepal’s relations with China, how they respond to the diverse demands of the various national/international actors, remaining steadfast to the One China Policy but without compromising its traditional stand as an open and tolerant society are going to test the political strength and diplomatic skill of Nepal’s republican rulers.
The best interest of Nepal is in nurturing a relationship of trust and confidence with both India and China. Rising China, Shining India and changing Nepal create new opportunities for all sides to strengthen the age old friendship for the benefit of the people of all three countries in the new century. But close geographic proximities and historic cultural ties must be nurtured by sincerity in mutuality of interests and benefits based on respect, trust and confidence.
Pro-active international role:
Vitality of relations with neighbors does not preclude pro-active role internationally. Strengthening relations with the new US administration, further deepening traditional friendship with UK, European Union, Russia, Japan, Germany and France are some of the other priorities. Greater visibility in the UN, exploring possibilities for membership of the Security Council lost two years ago or actively seek the Presidency of the UN General Assembly which Nepal has not had the opportunity to preside, enhanced Nepali role in UN peacekeeping work and greater UN economic assistance are other priorities of Nepal’s 21st Century diplomacy. Chairmanship of the LDC Group in New York is important but it must not be a consolation prize, at the cost of membership and leadership in other more important organs of the UN.
Active role in SAARC: 
A South Asian scholar characterizes the people of South Asia as Insecure, malnourished, ill and saturated with the fear of brute strength, violence is their only recourse and hatred their only wealth.
Nepal recently gained invaluable experience in resolving violent conflict peacefully. Leadership of wisdom could have launched a new Nepali initiative to address the chronic problem of poverty and political violence in South Asia with the elder statesman who presided over the political transition in Nepal playing the lead role in the regional and international arena rather than getting bogged down in the politics of national and personal self-annihilation. Such a forward looking and ambitious project, however requires leadership of wisdom, foresight, trust and confidence and counsel of comprehension and competence.
Establishment of the SAARC Secretariat and location of South Asian and Asian regional headquarters of several United Nations, other international inter-governmental and Non-governmental Organizations (INGOs) at Kathmandu has been one of the successes of Nepal’s foreign policy. However, since their establishment Nepal has not been able to play the kind of active role in them or utilize their valuable presence in promoting peace and cooperation in the region and the world and in the process promoting its own national interest.
Economic (Development) Diplomacy):
Trade, tourism, employment, investment and technology transfer are important dimensions of economic (development) diplomacy. Through a more active role in the WTO, International Financial Institutions, important capitals and leadership from the capital, if Nepal could convince major donors to write-off international debt (in which we spend close to 10 percent of our annual budget in debt servicing alone but some other least developed countries have already succeeded in having it written-off) what would be a bigger achievement of Nepal’s diplomacy?
Forward looking and Dynamic Diplomacy:
The suggestions this writer first made for opening new embassies in the remaining G-8 capitals (read Canada), Australia, Korea, Brazil and South Africa as part of a new dynamic and forward looking foreign policy after the successful People’s Movement of 2006 have already been implemented. Opening new embassies in the remaining G-20 capitals: Italy which is also a major international centre with offices of important multilateral agencies like the World Food Organization (FAO), World Food Program (WFP) and International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD); Afghanistan the new SAARC member undergoing difficult experience from which Nepal could learn a lot and thousands of Nepalis are believed to be working there; Nigeria, the largest country in Africa, one French speaking Africa; Vienna to look after UN offices and the IAEA besides bilateral work with Austria; Nairobi for the UN offices including UNEP and HABITAT and a separate ambassador to the WTO in Geneva could be some new aspects of promoting Nepal’s national interests through a dynamic and forward looking foreign policy. Of course, the cost-benefit of opening new diplomatic missions abroad needs serious thought. (The author is a former ambassador and a foreign policy expert)

Excerpts from a paper by the author at a South Asia Study centre seminar held October 21, 2009, Kathmandu, which was first published in The Telegraph Weekly on 2010-01-13.",/national,"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 02:51:05 +0000"
49,http://telegraphnepal.com/nepal-failing-federalism/," Prof. Durga D. Poudel, USA: On August 2, 2009, I published an article entitled “Federalism in Nepal: Issues and Concerns” in one of the online portals in Nepal, stressing a need for a thorough discussion on advantages and disadvantages of federalism before adopting it in the country.
Obviously, the ultimate goal of any administrative and political structure of a nation revolves around strengthening national integrity, enhancing prosperity, empowering people, protecting society, and promoting culture and tradition.
The 2009 Federalism article read:
“The historic Jana-Aandolan II culminated into the declaration of the republic in Nepal on May 28, 2008, after the constituent assembly polls. 560 of CA members voted in favor of the republic, ending 240 years of monarchy. However, the question remaining in many Nepalese minds even after several years down the lane is how is it that we ended up with the declaration of the federalism in our interim constitution without having sufficiently debated or discussed the viability of federalism in Nepal? This issue of national significance, unitary vs. federal, is critical for Nepal’s prosperity, pride, and national integrity. As a matter of fact, available literature suggests that a unitary system of governance is followed by about 170 nations, including England, France, Japan, and Bangladesh. Decentralization is extremely important for the success of a unitary system. I believe even if the interim constitution declares Nepal as a Federalist nation, it is still worthwhile and not too late to debate the pros and cons of federalism and take the right course of political action that ensures national integrity, empowers the people, protects our societies, enhances prosperity, and promotes our culture and traditions. While acknowledging the federalist’s views of the empowerment of ethnic groups and communities, right to self-determination, decentralization of governance, enhancement of the competition for development among the federal states, and even control on increasing population growth of Kathmandu Valley, I firmly believe that we need to seriously debate and discuss the viability and long-term impacts of federalism on national integrity, prosperity, equity, and resource allocation. Some of the issues and concerns regarding federalism in Nepal are as follows:
1. Danger of national disintegration:

The issue of national disintegration is perhaps the most important and frightening one. Available literature suggests that more than two dozen states have already disintegrated, including Somalia, Russia, Congo-Kinshasa, Nigeria, and Yugoslavia among others. Many of these states have gone through ethnic violence, chaos, and finally disintegration. Yugoslavia can be cited as an example for disintegration due to ethnic federalism. Marshal Joseph Broz Tito, the communist leader of Yugoslavia, acted on the devolution of powers from central government to ethnic and linguistic communities through the 1974 constitution. This eventually resulted in ethnic tensions and the disintegration of the state. Thus, the once kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918-41) has now turned into seven different nations (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Kosovo). The series of conflicts and the political upheavals resulted in the dissolution of Yugoslavia that had a similar population size as Nepal. Kosovo was declared independent in 2008, resulting in the final obliteration of Yugoslavia. It is important to understand the ethnic and linguistic composition of Yugoslavia prior to its disintegration. It had eight major ethnic groups: Serbian (35%), Croatian (19%), Muslim (8.9%), Slovene (7.8%), Albanian (7.7%), Macedonians (5.9%), Yugoslavs (5.4%), and Montenegrins (2.5%), and six major languages: Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, Macedonian, Albanian, Hungarian, and Italian. Not having a national majority of any ethnic or linguistic group and the imposition of ethnic federalism was perhaps the major cause of Yugoslavia’s eventual disintegration. Bolivia can be cited as another example of a nation with political turmoil and chaos due to ethnic federalism and indigenous nationalities.
2. Size of the nation:




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Just by looking at neighboring Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, we can see how small Nepal is in size as a nation. Do we really need to divide this nation for efficiency in governance or other reasons, especially during this age of inclusiveness, globalization, information technology, and communication?
3. Equity issue:
Not all the federal states will emerge as equally prosperous. States that are better endowed with natural resources and better economic policies and programs would prosper more than those with a lower natural resource base and incompetent developmental endeavors. Skilled manpower will have a similar scenario. Most qualified and dynamic individuals will congregate in the state(s) that can provide the most attractive benefits while other states may lack the trained manpower for even minimum fulfillment of states services such as health, education, engineering, etc. The poorer states will remain poor since there is no reason for the national government to substantially divert revenues generated from prosperous states. Prosperous states still need federal funding for their further development. This will certainly propel the equity issues among the federal states. While our concern is minimizing the gap between the rich and the poor, how is federalism going to positively contribute to social justice and equity?
4. Cost of governance under federalism:
It is obvious that additional governance mechanism will increase the cost of governance. While the nation is starving for resources to supply food, medicine, hospitals, and other critical facilities, how logical will it be to embark upon a system that results in a substantial increase on administrative budgets and expenses due to federal infrastructures and logistics?
5. Allocation of available natural resources:




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

There is no doubt that Nepal’s economic transformation relies on the sustainable utilization and the development of agricultural and natural resource base. A federal state without access to a sufficient natural resource base would undoubtedly lose its competitive edge for economic transformation. Conflicts in resource ownerships and utilization among the central government and the federal states may often be very serious and complicated. How does federalism ensure this very issue of equitable resource allocation among the Nepalese from Terai to the Himalayan region is extremely challenging. The author feels that it may never happen.
6. Type of federalism:
What type of federalism are we talking about – “Layer Cake” or “Marble Cake” or a different one? Will the state be more powerful than the center (Layer Cake) or the center will be equally powerful (Marble Cake)? Although initially federalism was envisioned as a weak Center, and more power was vested among the states, it is not presently happening. Whether it is China or the United States, major environmental programs, infrastructures, natural resources conservation and development initiatives, socio-economic transformation agendas, welfare programs, and research and development activities are increasingly federally funded and managed. This means even if we embrace the ideology of the autonomous state or empowered state, in the absence of significant involvement of the central government, there is no possibility for the states to develop. Hence, national government still has to continue its heavy involvement of infrastructural, industrial, educational, and socio-economic development of the nation.
7. Economic growth
There is no doubt that poor economic conditions are one of the major causes of political unrest, upheavals, and revolt in Nepal. It is noteworthy to observe our neighboring nations of India and China for their political structures and their recent economic development. While India is a federal nation with federal states based on languages and ethnicity, China is a nation with a unitary system. Despite being under these two contrasting diverse governing systems, both nations have realized amazing economic growth in recent years and are emerging as major economic powers in the world. Both nations are becoming the global hubs of science and Information technology. What is the common underlying factor between the two nations that has caused both to successfully achieve magnificent economic growth? Certainly, it is not federalism or political structure. It is their embracement of globalization, development of private sector for economic growth, generation of employment, political stability, peace and security, and governmental commitment. On the other hand, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, one of the nations with ethnic-federalism, is seriously struggling for economic growth. Thus, federalism does not necessarily ensure economic growth and prosperity, nor is it necessary to have federalism for a nation’s development.
Without any doubt, we are passing through a critical phase in the political history of Nepal. It is our obligation to think deeply, understand correctly, analyze the situation objectively, and take the appropriate future course of actions aptly keeping in mind the national integrity, the society, our norms and values, as well as our culture and traditions. Looking at the views presented in Constituent Assembly and vision for the new constitution, it is not difficult to assess that there is a national need for an in-depth analysis, discussion, debate, and conclusion with respect to federalism in Nepal. While we must envision the development of a Nepalese society that is free from any kind of subjugation and discrimination, it is important to have an appropriate political structure and governance system for a fast paced, overall socio-economic transformation of the nation. Restructuring of the state, that has been under the unitary system of governance for the last 240 years, on the basis of ethnicity, language, or even natural resources will obviously pose a great challenge.”
Nearly after 10 years of the publication “Federalism in Nepal: Issues and Concerns”, and more than one year of implementation of federalism in Nepal, issues and concerns raised on federalized governance about 10 years ago have become more relevant and even more pressing. There are widespread reporting of cases of malpractices, corruption, misuse of resources, encroachment of public lands, illegal logging, bribes, killings, rapes, human trafficking, over-extraction of natural resources, and social disorder in the country. Corruption and briberies have become so rampant that even the Chief of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority has been caught red-handed recently receiving 78 lakh rupees bribe. Corruption scandals like wide body airbus, 33 Kg gold, Swiss bank deposits, and various construction companies’ ruthless cheating of the nation constitute recent media highlights in Nepal. Government expenditures for the purchase of 1,600 vehicles, salaries and allowances for elected officials under federal system, and expenses on office buildings and spaces specially provincial and local governments include just some of the expanded governmental expenses due to federalism in the country. In this context, there are many questions in relation to federalism that Nepalese society is seeking urgent answers. Some of these questions include, how justifiable is this enormous expansion of government size and related expenses for a country that is increasingly experiencing trade deficit, unemployment, declining agricultural productivity, and rising public debt? How would federalism address natural resources conservation, development, and utilization issues that crosscut political boundaries? How would provincial and local governments build their capacities for planning and development? How would you control corruption, which is already so rampant and massive in every sector of the society including political, governance, judiciary, security, and private sector, by expanding administrative structure further to provincial and local levels under federalism? How would you ensure fast-paced economic development, good governance, social justice, and socio-economic transformation of Nepalese society? Federalized administrative structure also requires high level of capacity-building at the local, provincial, and national level for coordinated planning and development, policy decision-making; project formulation, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation; and for overall development of the nation. In the absence of appropriate capacity-building, enforcement of strict anti-corruption measures, and the availability of necessary financial and technical resources, ominous signs are already visible in the society that federalism is resulting in more corruption, misuse of resources, poverty, and social unrest. Lately, public frustration on federalism is increasingly surfacing through various media, public sentiments, and political statements. Major factors responsible for failing federalism in Nepal include excessively high cost of governance, lack of capacity-building, massive corruption, implementation failure of developmental projects, lack of coordination of governmental activities, federalism-imposed tax burden on public, and, more importantly, implementation of federalism without thorough discussion about its relevancy in Nepal.

Last but not the least, Nepal Finance Ministry had estimated an initial cost of Rs. 800 Arab for the development of basic infrastructure to start federalism in Nepal, while World Bank estimates 3-4% of Nepal’s GDP per year, which comes to be another Rs. 400 Arab, for next four years for transitioning into federalism.
In 2017/2018 Fiscal Year, Nepal Government appropriated Rs. 225 Arab to Provincial and Local Governments and Rs. 150 Arab was transferred. However, the sub-national governments were able to spend less than half of the allocated funds. Thus, there exists a twin problem of finding large amount of funds to meet the expenses of federalism and meanwhile developing efficiency that is necessary for productive spending of the money. Obviously, most expenses of federalism must have to come from people’s pockets. This simply proves that federalism is too costly for Nepal.",/national,"Sun, 17 Feb 2019 03:40:59 +0000"
