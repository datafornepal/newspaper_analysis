FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/weak-institutions-hit-economic-growth/,"Poor spending performance by public institutions a challenge for the economy
KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

The ordinance will now be sent to the President for certification.
The Authority, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister, is being set up prior to the international donors’ conference, scheduled for June 25, which aims at seeking support from the international communities to rebuild Nepal.
When the ordinance is certified, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala will nominate four ministers and three experts as members of the high-level body, according to Minister for General Administration Lalbabu Pandit.
Likewise, Vice-Chairperson of the National Planning Commission and Chief Secretary will be members of the Authority.
The post-earthquake Reconstruction Authority will have a chief executive officer also. It will oversee all reconstruction works in the earthquake-hit districts where physical infrastructures have been damaged.
Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam informed that there will be a separate committee of foreign consultants that would be constantly supporting the Authority in its job.
According to the government’s assessment, the tremors caused damage worth Rs 513.38 billion to physical infrastructure and assets, and inflicted income loss of another Rs 187.08 billion.
The government has set the target to collect more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors for the post-earthquake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
 Objectives of International Conference on Nepal’s Reconstruction

KATHMANDU: The government has set the target to garner more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors’ conference being organised on June 25 for the post-quake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
A study of losses caused by the devastating Gorkha Quake on April 25 and its aftershocks in various regions across the country shows that physical infrastructures worth Rs 512 billion were damaged by the quake and over Rs 666 billion was needed for reconstruction, rehabilitation and new construction.
The government is preparing to collect the assistance by presenting the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) report in the conference prepared by the National Planning Commission for the same.
According to the PDNA report, over Rs 399 billion is necessary for reconstruction and rehabilitation tasks in cultural heritage, education, health and human settlement sectors.
Similarly, Rs 117 billion is needed for reconstruction of agriculture, industry, irrigation and tourism sectors.
Likewise, the PDNA report estimates that it will cost Rs 74.26 billion for reconstruction of media, community infrastructures, hydropower, transport and drinking water and sanitation sectors while Rs 75.11 billion to recover the damaged gender, social security, nutrition, employment, environment and forest areas into previous position.

Aiming for interconnected energy junction for economic growth through cross-border power transmission lines between Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Myanmar, the concerned stakeholders of the said countries have sought setting up of a new type of energy trading.
During a discussion held here on Wednesday, the participants highlighted some similar key characteristics of the region, including rapidly growing energy demand, significant seasonal complementarities and large but unevenly distributed primary energy potential mostly coming from hydropower.
They also identified some challenges to the region’s electricity systems. For instance, electricity supply is irregular and has been unable to keep up with the demand.
Inefficient, costly and pollution intensive power sources have also increased the transmission losses, the participants said, adding that effectively addressing these challenges require crossborder energy trading.
Ashish Garg, general secretary of Independent Power Producers’ Association – Nepal (IPPAN), informed that the concerned stakeholders agreed on the need to arrange necessary framework to establish cross-border power connectivity between the aforementioned countries. In this regard, the meeting recommended encouraging specific cross-border power projects between Indian sub-regional countries and Nepal based on specific advantages involved, joint benefits and costs of generation capacities, he informed.
Emphasising multiple economic, social and environmental benefits of increased cross-border energy cooperation and cross-border energy trade, the participants stressed on the need to expand power trade between Nepal and Myanmar with India as a transit country. “This level of connectivity can bring significant benefits in terms of incentives to produce and price power efficiently and flexibly by Nepal,” said Garg.
Moreover, the participants suggested putting in place an effective cross-border institutional body to coordinate among national regulatory mechanisms of member states. But in the long run, it would require additional efforts to harmonise access rules, develop protocols for grid management especially ensuring minimum grid code and establishing favourable and non-discriminatory transmission charges, they said.
They also underscored the need for proper functioning of South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation framework, Bhutan, Bangladesh, India and Nepal framework, among others, for robust regional trade and cooperation — including energy trade — between various authorities.
The discussion programme was jointly organised by IPPAN and Confederation of Indian Industry and Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia. The programme was participated by representatives from the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation, Nepal Electricity Regulatory Commission, Embassy of India in Nepal, Japanese Embassy in Nepal, Japan International Cooperation Agency, International Finance Corporation, International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development and Asia Foundation.

The World Bank has approved an additional credit of $200 million (equivalent to Rs 22.82 billion) for the implementation of the Earthquake Housing Reconstruction Project (EHRP) in Nepal.

An agreement to this effect was signed today between Shreekrishna Nepal, joint secretary at the Ministry of Finance and Faris H Hadad- Zervos, World Bank’s country manager for Nepal.
The EHRP and the second additional financing contributes to Nepal’s umbrella Housing Reconstruction Programme (HRP), which aims to rebuild earthquake-resistant core housing units by providing housing grants to eligible beneficiaries who have enrolled in the programme, as per the World Bank.
Moreover, the World Bank said that the second additional financing will scale up EHRP’s support to the government’s HRP by financing reconstruction of an additional 86,680 houses in the 32 districts affected by the 2015 earthquake.
“The government of Nepal expresses its sincere appreciation to the World Bank for this assistance and its continued support in the post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction efforts of Nepal. This support is instrumental and it will help to achieve the government’s commitment to complete individual housing reconstruction by this fiscal year,” said Joint Secretary Nepal.
The government has been implementing the post-earthquake housing reconstruction project since August 14, 2015, with a credit amount of $200 million. The first additional credit of $300 million was approved on December 15, 2017. As of January 31, 2020, out of 683,367 beneficiaries enrolled under the EHRP in 14 most-affected districts, 99 per cent have received the first tranche, 82 per cent have received the second tranche, and 71 per cent have received the third tranche of the housing grant.
“Five years hence, a lasting memory of the Nepal earthquake is that of the resilience of the people of Nepal,” stated Faris Hadad-Zervos of the bank. “We join Nepal’s development community in continuing support to the government to help families affected by the earthquake rebuild their lives.”
Implemented by the National Reconstruction Authority, the EHRP adopts an owner-driven housing reconstruction approach that promotes earthquake-resistant building techniques and materials and aims at improving long-term resilience through a culture of safer and sustainable housing and settlements.
Under the project, eligible beneficiaries receive grants of Rs 300,000 each for reconstruction of houses in compliance with approved reconstruction guidelines in three tranches.
The impact of the earthquakes is estimated at 35 per cent of Nepal’s gross domestic product with recovery needs of about $7 billion.

The Department of Money Laundering Investigation (DoMLI) has started a probe into properties of those who have been dragged into the corruption case in the Lalita Niwas land grab scandal.
The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), on Wednesday, had filed a corruption case against 175 individuals, including former deputy prime minister and Nepali Congress Vice President Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, former ministers Dambar Shrestha and Chandra Dev Joshi for their role in Lalita Niwas land grab scam. The anti-graft body has also named Rukma Shumsher JB Rana and his family members as defendants in the case.
Roop Narayan Bhattarai, director general at DoMLI, informed that the department has already started investigating the properties of those involved in the corruption case including high-level political leaders and bureaucrats.
“We had already started a probe into the assets of those suspected to be involved in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. We have intensified the probe in line with the corruption case filed by the anti-graft body recently,” said Bhattarai.
Though the CIAA investigation of those seen involved in the Lalita Niwas land grab case is limited to this case only, Bhattarai said that the DoMLI is carrying out an investigation into all the assets of those who have been accused and whose source is suspicious.
“The investigation is ongoing and we will soon reach a conclusion,” he added.
Meanwhile, Bhattarai also said that the department is carrying out a series of investigations on suspicious properties of various other people, including business leaders and corporate houses.
The CIAA has accused NC Vice President Gachhadar and former minister Shrestha of embezzling Rs 96 million each. Similarly, former minister Joshi has been accused of embezzling Rs 70 million.
Former secretaries Deep Basnyat, Chhabi Raj Panta and Dinesh Hari Adhikari have also been indicted in the case. The anti-graft body has accused Basnyat and Panta of embezzling Rs 96 million each. Likewise, Adhikari has been accused of embezzling Rs 70 million.
The CIAA has stated in the chargesheet filed on Wednesday that the government had duly acquired 284 ropanis land of Lalita Niwas, but after restoration of democracy in 1990 the land plots were illegally transferred in the names of various individuals.
The CIAA has said that the accused in the Lalita Niwas land grab case colluded with government authorities to transfer land plots to their names.

With almost 30 per cent of construction work of the India-backed 900-megawatt SJVN Arun-III completed so far, the developer company inked the financial closure of the hydroelectric project with seven banks here today.
Officials of five Indian banks, two Nepali banks and SJVN Arun-III Power Development Company penned an agreement to invest a total of Rs 101.28 billion in the project. The company will chip in an additional Rs 27 billion as equity investment.
According to the pact, among the Indian lenders, State Bank of India will invest Rs 35.52 billion, Punjab National Bank Rs 15.29 billion, Canara Bank Rs 15.28 billion, EXIM Bank of India Rs 12.25 billion and Union Bank of India will invest Rs 7.63 billion. Among Nepali lenders, Everest Bank will invest Rs 10.22 billion and Nabil Bank will provide Rs 5.13 billion for the project.
Arun-III is an export-based project, which will bring the largest-ever government-to-government level foreign direct investment from India worth nearly $1.2 billion.
On Tuesday, Investment Board Nepal had granted Arun-III project permission to ink financial closure with the aforesaid banks.
Nand Lal Sharma, chairman-cum-managing director of Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd, India — which has been tasked with building the project — said the project was scheduled to be completed by 2023. “But we plan to complete it before schedule.” He added that the company had faced hurdles at the project site, including lack of proper road access to transport equipment on time.
“Nevertheless, we have received tremendous support from the Nepal government to cross the hurdles in a timely manner,” he said. Sharma added that the project had so far achieved almost 30 per cent progress in physical work and 12 per cent in financial work till date. “At present, we are executing construction work through our equity investment worth Rs 27 billion,” he said.
Meanwhile, Anil Shah, CEO of Nabil Bank, said the bank had made the investment to gain experience in large-size hydel projects in collaboration with multi-national firms.
“We believe that Nepali banks and financial institutions need to gain experience to handle large-size investments.”
The project has accelerated the civil, hydromechanical and electro-mechanical works, simultaneously.
The company had awarded the aforementioned works to an Indian firm — JP Construction — which has already started executing construction work. SJVN stated that it would start construction of a 400-kVA high-voltage cross-border transmission line from March.
IBN and SJVN had inked a pact in November 2014 for the project development agreement of ArunIII hydropower project. The project was supposed to start generating energy by 2020 as per the earlier agreement. However, IBN and SJVN reached an agreement later to complete the construction of the project by 2023.
Arun Dhaiman, CEO of the project, said there had been noticeable momentum in major work of the hydropower project, such as construction of headrace tunnel, audit tunnel and powerhouse.
Apart from shares being allocated to locals and free energy to the affected areas, the government will get Rs 330 billion as royalty in a period of 20 years and the project will also provide 21.9 per cent of the generated energy free of cost.
The project will generate 400 million units of power every year.
As per the agreement with IBN, the developer will hand over the ownership of the project to the government of Nepal after 20 years of commercial operation.

Bankers have urged the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) to change the method of calculating interest rate spread through the mid-term review of Monetary Policy.
At discussion programme held by the central bank today, the bankers said that provisions aimed at reducing profit of banks will affect the entire banking and financial sector and asked NRB to review such provisions.
“It is high time to promote merger and acquisition policy of banks and financial institutions (BFIs) to make the financial sector more reliable and robust. However, provisions related to spread rate calculation and others have been affecting banks, which need to be reviewed,” said Bhuvan Dahal, president of Nepal Bankers’ Association (NBA) — the umbrella organisation representing 27 commercial banks in the country.
He added that the government policies should not affect the income of banks BFIs are expanding their services and network and making huge investment in technology and security.
In August, NBA had officially objected the NRB’s decision to revise the formula to calculate the spread rate that banks are required to maintain. The change in the calculation of spread rate will directly affect the income tax being paid by banking sector and also hit lending capacity of banks, as per NBA.
According to NRB’s rule, banks cannot include their interest-earning from investments in government securities while calculating the spread rate as allowed earlier.
The central bank has also barred banks from incorporating the earnings from investment in the spread rate calculation.

Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has said it will invest Rs 335 billion for the construction of infrastructure in the aviation sector over the period of five years.
According to Pradeep Adhikari, director of CAAN, the authority plans to spend Rs 250 billion for international aviation infrastructure and its related land acquisition. Out of the amount, the government will spend Rs 150 billion for the first phase of construction work at Nijgadh International Airport (NIA). Similarly, the authority plans to spend the remaining amount for full fledged operation of the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), Pokhara Regional International Airport (PRIA) and Gautam Buddha International Airport (GBIA).
For the purpose of land acquisition for the international airports, CAAN plans to spend Rs five billion.
As per CAAN, Rs 46 billion will be spent for the construction of domestic airports. The amount will be spent to transform Biratnagar, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Mahendranagar airports into regional airports within five years.
The aviation authority had already developed a master plan for the four aforementioned domestic airports.
According to Rajan Pokharel, director general of CAAN, the construction work will be carried out by acquiring the necessary land simultaneously. The land acquisition cost for the domestic airports has been estimated at Rs 34 billion.
CAAN had invested Rs 89 billion in air infrastructure in the past two years. A large amount of that money was spent on land acquisition worth Rs 33 billion and the remaining Rs 49 billion was spent for the construction of infrastructure of the international airports.
As per the authority, it spent Rs one billion for land acquisition and Rs six billion for construction works of various domestic airports across Nepal in the aforementioned period.
“We are planning to increase the capacity and upgrade the airports located in the Tarai region so that Airbus and Boeing aircraft will able to land and take off from there,” said Pokharel, adding the airports in the mountainous and hilly regions — where only twin otters are being operated currently — will also be upgraded so that they can accommodate at least 40-seater aircraft.
Meanwhile, in the press briefing programme today, Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Yogesh Bhattarai claimed that NIA will be operational within the next five years.
“The government is serious about bringing the airport into operation at any cost.”
Minister Bhattarai said that along with TIA’s expansion, construction of PRIA, GBIA and NIA will be completed within five years. “We plan to increase annual tourist arrivals to 10 million by next five years and we need to complete the construction all the aforesaid airports to handle such a large numbers of foreign visitors.”

Nepal Telecom (NT), a state-owned telecommunication company, has declared that it has successfully expanded its 4G telecom service in all 77 districts of the country.
Speaking during an event organised to mark the 16th anniversary of Nepal Telecom here today, Dilli Ram Adhikari, managing director of NT, announced that the company had successfully tested its 4G telecom service in Simikot, the headquarters of Humla district, on Tuesday.
Humla was the last district that was to be connected to NT’s 4G service.
According to him, with the successful expansion of its 4G service in Humla, NT has become the first and largest telecom service provider of the country.
Till date, NT has installed 3,683 4G service compatible base transceiver station (BTS) towers across Nepal and has also set up 200 towers recently that are only 4G compatible.
Stating that the telecom company is expanding its service as per the demand from the consumers, Adhikari said, “We plan to upgrade 2,200 BTS towers to make them 4G compatible while add new 640 4G BTS towers across the country soon.”
He further said that the company has started to implement the federal system and is in the process of converting its regional offices into provincial headquarters to provide effective service to NT subscribers. “We are gearing up to facilitate the government in realising its vision of ‘Digital Nepal’.”
Meanwhile, addressing the programme, Minister for Communications and Information Technology Gokul Prasad Baskota called on the firm to rise up to the challenges that crop up with the changing times while simultaneously enhancing its quality and service.
Minister Baskota also took a swipe at the trade unions and said, “The government will not tolerate anyone trying to permeate politics in state companies that provide essential services. Those interested in politics should join the political parties.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/india-may-allow-import-of-palm-oil-from-nepal/,"Kathmandu, February 5
India seems to be positive about resuming the trade of refined palm oil from Nepal.
Officials at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies (MoICS) informed that the Indian authorities are willing to allow Indian traders to import refined palm oil from Nepal, which has been halted since January 10.
Aimed at taming Malaysia, India had imposed a blanket restriction on import of palm oil. This directly affected the trade of Nepal’s top export item — refined palm oil. Since then, the government has been holding bilateral discussions (both formal and informal) with India to resume the palm oil trade.
A week after the Indian government stopped importing refined palm oil from Nepal, the government on January 18 had formally asked the southern neighbour to allow Nepali traders to export the commodity in the Indian market. Since then, authorities of the two nations have held series of formal and informal discussions to lift the ban for Nepal.
“Indian authorities seemed positive towards allowing its traders to import palm oil from Nepal during the formal and informal discussions held at various levels,” informed a source at MoICS, adding that India, however, is yet to officially respond to Nepal government’s request for exemption from the ban on import of refined palm oil.
Sources at MoICS said that commerce secretaries of both nations are holding discussions every day to resume the trade of country’s largest export item to Indian market.
Nepal has been urging India to lift the ban on import of refined palm oil from Nepal citing that the country is not a bulk exporter of the product and that Nepali traders export palm oil in small packages ranging from one kg to 15 kg, which are widely used by Indian households.
“Our palm oil exports account for a mere one per cent of Indian imports of the commodity,” informed Nabaraj Dhakal, joint secretary at MoICS.
“We are hopeful that the ban on import of refined palm oil from Nepal will be lifted as India’s import restriction on the product did not primarily intend to curb import of the product from Nepal.”
Nepali traders import crude palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia, process and package it here, before sending it to India. Although Nepal does not have competitive or comparative advantage in exporting palm oil to India, its rising export in recent months had played a crucial role in raising the country’s export base and narrowing the trade deficit.

Tulasi Prasad Gautam, administrator of EPF, said they have already started the process to establish the company.
“We have already proposed to the Ministry of Finance to amend the existing EPF Act and include necessary provisions to establish a stock dealer company.”
“As per talks with the ministry, it will soon amend the EPF Act and table it at the Cabinet for approval,” he said, adding, “As per our understanding with the concerned stakeholders and the ministry, the act will be amended in this Parliament’s winter season.”
According to Gautam, EPF will establish the company with other stakeholders, including banks and insurance companies, as shareholders, where EPF will hold the majority stake in the company.
He further claimed that the company will be the largest-ever stock dealer company in Nepal and will be able to hold shares worth billions of rupees of different companies.

Most of the Chinese-contracted projects operating in Nepal have been stalled since one month due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
While the skilled and semiskilled Chinese workers who had returned home to celebrate the Lunar New Year have been unable to return due to travel restrictions following the rapid spread of coronavirus, import of equipment has also been halted, thereby affecting numerous infrastructure projects, including hydropower and airports.
The affected projects — that are being built by the Chinese contractors — include Rasuwagadhi Hydropower, Tanahu Hydropower, Upper Trishuli 3B, Melamchi Dirinking Water Project, Upper Tamakoshi, Huaxin Cement, Gautam Buddha International Airport, Pokhara Regional International Airport, Melamchi Drinking Water Project and construction works of parking bays at Tribhuvan International Airport.
As the China government has temporarily barred its citizens from travelling abroad without prior permission, Chinese workers have not returned to Mid-Bhotekoshi, Sanjeen, Nyadi, Marsyangdi, Dorde Khola hydropower projects, among others.
Kul Man Ghising, managing director of Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), informed that 111-megawatt Rasuwagadhi Hydropower Co Ltd — a subsidiary company of NEA — has already submitted a letter seeking ‘force majeure’ for the construction works. “Should the situation remain the same for another month or two, the company will be forced to declare emergency and halt all construction works.”
Informing that supply of all necessary hydro equipment has been affected as well, Ghising said, “Depending on how the situation pans out, the completion date of projects could be pushed back by at least six months to one and-a-half years.”
“We are currently gathering necessary information and carrying out an initial assessment of the loss caused by coronavirus.”
As per hydropower developers, more than 1,000 workers associated with different hydropower projects are currently stalled in China due to the coronavirus epidemic.
According to Kumar Pandey, vice-president of Independent Power Producers Association- Nepal (IPPAN), more than 30 under-construction hydropower projects have been affected due to coronavirus outbreak due to lack of necessary equipment and semi-skilled and skilled human resources.
Stating that it was too early to get a clear picture of the impact of the virus on hydropower projects, Pandey said the developers could face losses amounting to billions of rupees, which in turn could even massively hit the economy.
Rajan Pokharel, director general of Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, said that around 350 Chinese workers engaged in different airport construction projects are stuck in China. “We have been informed that some 200 Chinese workers involved in Pokhara Regional International Airport and 50 workers in Gautam Buddha International Airport (GBIA) are currently stalled in China.”
Likewise, 100 Chinese workers, who were scheduled to land in Nepal for construction of new parking bays and parallel taxiways at the TIA, have also been unable to come due to the travel restrictions. The project has already been awarded to a Chinese contractor — China National Aero Technology International Engineering Corporation.
Pokharel further said the GBIA project is facing equipment scarcity related to airfield lighting system, including runway and approach lights. “We had planned to visit a factory in China to finalise the equipment, but our plans have been put on hold because of the pandemic.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/oversight-mechanisms-should-simplify-regulatory-works-instead-of-making-them-more-complex/,"Though Nepal Electricity Authority has eliminated load-shedding from the country, the power utility has been facing major problems of power tripping due to the low capacity of its distribution and transmission system. The country will have excess energy from next fiscal year when 1,000 megawatts of electricity will be added to the national grid, along with the completion of the 456MW Upper Tamakoshi hydroelectric project. At the moment, NEA is working to reinforce and upgrade the transmission and distribution system for reliable power supply and increased electricity consumption. However, NEA too has not been spared from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, as most of the projects, including generation and transmission and distribution systems, are being handled by Chinese contractors. In this context, Umesh Poudel of The Himalayan Times caught up with Kul Man Ghising, managing director of NEA, to learn what the power utility has been doing in terms of making reliable its distribution and transmission system, among other issues. Excerpts:
NEA has eliminated load-shedding from the country. However, power supply is still unreliable due to some constraints in distribution and transmission system. How long will it take to address such issues? 
Our distribution system may seem unreliable owing to some technical issues. This is because the entire distribution system has not been upgraded, while the consumption of electricity is increasing. While dust pollution is a major problem in Nepal, the power insulation process becomes more affected due to the rain. Coupled with increased demand in the winter season, all the transformers, feeders and cables are overloaded. Because of this, we have been facing the problem of power-tripping. Hence, we have accorded high priority to instal, repair and maintain the entire transmission and distribution system. We are now installing double-circuit high-voltage transmission line network in the problematic areas to supply reliable electricity to the customers. We have recently added more than 500 transformers in Kathmandu Valley and more than 7,000 transformers across the country. This is the transition phase. So, after the upgradation of transmission and distribution systems is completed, we will be able to supply reliable power to the consumers. However, it will obviously take some time. Additionally, after we urged the consumers to increase the use of electricity — which was aimed at gauging the actual demand in the country — we have witnessed the problem of power tripping in certain areas. But this will eventually lead to a power saturation phase, and consequently reliable supply. Currently, NEA is working to add more substations, transformers, and expand multiple high-voltage transmission line networks. However, there are certain challenges. For example, we are facing some opposition in certain areas related to land acquisition and other social issues, where the locals are not providing the land and right of way for the transmission line. Regarding power tripping in Kathmandu Valley, it is primarily because the locals of Lalitpur district are obstructing the construction of Lapsiphedi-Matatirtha-Chapagaun transmission line.

The country is scheduled to generate surplus energy from next fiscal year. How is NEA planning to manage the surplus power and increase power consumption?
From next fiscal year, additional 1,000 megawatts of electricity will be evacuated in the national grid. Basically if we are unable to upgrade the existing transmission and distribution lines, customers will be unable to consume as much electricity as they want. We have already formulated a master plan for generation, transmission and distribution of power. So, we need more financial support to implement the plan so that our capacity can be enhanced and reliable supply of power can be ensured. At present, the distribution lines in most of the industrial corridors and major cities are overloaded. So, we need to instal alternative transmission lines in those areas, but we are facing problems related to funds and land acquisition. The federal, provincial and local governments should cooperate with us so that our plan can be materialised. Once our transmission and distribution lines have been made robust, we can focus on increasing local consumption. Since energy consumption is high in urban areas, we have been focusing on them. Currently, 80 per cent of the population has access to energy. As per the government’s vision, we need to complete rural electrification within next two years and we are also working towards realising that vision. We recently sought expression of interest from global contractors to instal 50 electric charging stations across the country. The number of stations will be increased in the future, as per demand. Actually as the country is on the cusp of generating surplus energy, we should also consider shifting our mass transportation system from fossil fuel to clean energy. However, this may take some time. We have submitted a proposal to Nepal Electricity Regulatory Commission to lower the power tariff for general consumers so that they can be encouraged to use induction stoves, electric vehicles, among other electric appliances. The government must also raise the price of cooking gas. However, as industries are the biggest consumers of electricity, I believe the government should provide incentives to establish new industries across the country. Currently, the demand for electricity in the country goes up during the day and drops at night. So, we are going to synchronise our grid system with that of India to supply excess power to the Indian power market. As per the concept of energy banking with India, we will supply excess energy to India in the wet season and import equal quantum of energy in the winter season through the Dhalkebar-Muzzaffarpur cross-border transmission line.
Subsidiary firms of NEA that have been assigned different projects often miss the deadline. What is causing the delay? 
As we all know, a number of projects led by NEA were affected by the earthquake in 2015 for almost two years. Similarly, some projects were affected owing to issues of contractors. However, construction of most of the NEA-led projects at present is efficient. Some projects have been delayed due to different geological issues, while some are due to weaknesses of contractors. It takes time to cope with geological issues while NEA will sort out issues related to contractors to ensure smooth project development. The primary cause of delay in NEA-led projects are the different geological surprises in the project sites and natural calamities while inefficiency of contractors and consultants has also led to delay of a few projects. Sadly, there is no instance of any hydropower project in the country being constructed on schedule.
The country has not been able to start any reservoir hydel projects. Why is it so? 
Compared to run-of-the-river (RoR) and peaking run-of-the-river (PRoR) projects, reservoir projects take more time. We have finalised the 635-megawatt Dudkoshi reservoir project and we are currently dealing with the financing aspect of the project. Similarly, other reservoir projects, including Tanahu Hydro, are being constructed. However, some projects have been delayed due to social issues. Such issues have been addressed immediately through collective efforts.
The power purchase agreement of different hydel projects has been halted for almost nine months. Where actually is the problem? 
The NERC must give approval to every PPA. Though NEA could take a decision regarding PPA earlier, everything related to the PPA today needs approval and authentication from the commission. Project developers have to undergo a longer procedure to get the PPA approved by the commission. The process could be expedited if the commission dealt with the policy- and tariff-related issues, while allowing NEA to deal with basic issues related to PPA on its own. Personally I believe that oversight mechanisms should simplify regulatory works instead of making them more complex.
The coronavirus outbreak has hit not only China but is spreading across the globe, including Nepal. How do you think will this affect our power generation, transmission and distribution projects as most of the contractors and equipment are from China? 
The coronavirus outbreak has become a major concern for us. Most of the contractors and necessary equipment — including transformers and gas-insulated high-voltage switchgear systems being used in our hydropower projects, transmission lines, substations and distribution lines — are from China. At present, we have not been able to send our technical team to China or call the Chinese technical team to inspect our projects as per the contract agreement. As per the Chinese officials, factories have been closed down due to the fear of the coronavirus. So, it will hit our equipment supply system and there will be delays in our projects. Most of the Chinese who were working in our projects had gone home for the Chinese New Year and now they cannot return as the Chinese government has not authorised people to go abroad without their prior permission. Our projects will be affected due to shortage of technical manpower and equipment.
You are in the last year of your four-year tenure at NEA. How far have you accomplished your plans and commitments? 
The day I joined NEA as its managing director, I had expressed my commitment to focus on three things — end load-shedding, make NEA profitable and make Nepal self-reliant in electricity. Interestingly, the problem related to load-shedding has been ended, NEA has started making profits and the country is almost self-reliant in hydroelectricity. Nepal is self-reliant in electricity in the wet season, while it will take some more time for the country to be self-reliant during the dry season. The import of electricity from India is in a decreasing trend — and this is despite the fact that there has been a significant rise in demand of electricity in the country. Nepal will start exporting electricity during wet season from next year while import of electricity during dry season next year will be minimal. Now the challenge remains to make Nepal’s hydropower sector reliable. Reliability of any sector depends on the reliability of the entire system in the country. Construction of transmission lines should go in line with the production of hydroelectricity. Similarly, we also need to ensure reliable distribution of electricity by developing necessary substations at different places and upgrade existing substations. The other challenge is to ensure access of every Nepali to electricity. When I joined NEA three years ago, access to electricity was at around 62 per cent of the population, against 80 per cent at present. We are preparing to announce 40 districts as districts with 100 per cent access to electricity this year. Ensuring every district with 100 per cent access to electricity is a challenge that we should focus on today.

The government has said it will start specific market monitoring targeting different hatcheries and poultry firms in the country from Tuesday amid rising price of chicken in the domestic market since the last few weeks.
Chicken price, which was recorded at Rs 280 per kg a month ago, has reached Rs 400 per kg in the retail market in the recent days.
Netra Prasad Subedi, director general of the Department of Commerce, Supply and Consumer Protection, said that market inspection will be carried out from Tuesday as the price of chicken is increasing unnaturally.
“Complaints have been registered citing that poultry entrepreneurs are arbitrarily hiking the price,” said Subedi, adding poultry entrepreneurs and farms found to be raising chicken price arbitrarily will be penalised.
Meanwhile, poultry entrepreneurs have said that the rise in price of chicken is due to inadequate supply in the market. “As the production of chicken has come down drastically, its price has gone up,” said Rishi Ram Poudel, central senior vice-president of Nepal Hatchery Industry Association.
It is to be noted that hatcheries had stopped production of chicks for two weeks in December and destroyed ready-to-hatch eggs to pressurise government to raise the price of chicken citing growing loss amid surplus production.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/ministries-asked-to-submit-details-of-projects/,"Kathmandu, February 3
The National Planning Commission (NPC) — the apex body that frames the country’s development plans and policies — has asked all ministries to submit the details of ongoing projects and new projects to be incorporated in the budget for the upcoming fiscal year 2020-21 within February 27.
NPC has sought project details for the upcoming fiscal budget based on the provision of Financial Procedure and Fiscal Accountability Act, 2019, which delegates the authority to the apex planning body of the government for assessment, pre-evaluation (appraisal) and examination of the projects and programmes and their concurrence for execution at the federal level through establishment of the project bank on the basis of various analytical approaches, including cost-benefit analysis.
Moreover, the legislation states that only projects approved and authenticated by NPC and included in the project bank will be incorporated in the budget. NPC plans to start implementing the ‘project bank’ concept from the upcoming fiscal budget and details of projects to be included in the budget have been sought from ministries accordingly, informed Sushil Bhatta, an NPC member.
The commission plans to make the project bank fully functional by 2022-23.
“Implementation of this concept in a full-fledged manner will discourage the tendency of incorporating pork barrel projects in the budget. We will start its implementation from the budget for upcoming fiscal year itself,” said Bhatta.
Along with this, implementation of the project bank concept will also ensure good governance, enhance decision-making and credibility of development projects, resulting in desired outcomes from public expenditure in development projects, opined Bhatta.
As per standards set by NPC, projects to be incorporated in the project bank will have to pass three different stages — project identification, project appraisal and project selection and prioritisation.
The project identification process involves five steps — idea generation, strategic fit assessment, preferred option selection, pre-feasibility study and project concept note.
Following the approval of the project concept note by NPC, line ministries are required to conduct feasibility study and/or detailed project report (DPR) for establishing project viability, which is done through the project appraisal process. The final output of this stage is project proposal of each individual project.
Project appraisal is a structured way of assessing a project to check its viability and to establish the justification of the project for allocation of resources it demands for implementation.
The third stage that a project must pass to be incorporated in the project bank is the project selection and prioritisation. This final stage is an important and crucial stage in project portfolio management to ensure allocation efficiency in development plans. This stage establishes a strong linkage of projects with sector development strategies and their integration in the national development plans. This integration requires prioritisation of projects on the basis of their contribution to national development and their selection based on available resources.
“Implementation of the project bank will not only be important in discouraging pork barrel projects but will also help expedite project construction and development activities,” added Bhatta.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/alphabet-shares-fall-as-google-misses-on-sales-youtube-revenue-disappoints/,"
SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet Inc’s new Chief Executive Sundar Pichai unveiled sales figures that investors have long demanded, but shares fell 5% as Google’s advertising business and the new data about YouTube and Google Cloud broadly disappointed.
Pichai had sought to counter slowing revenue growth in the company’s main advertising business by pointing to the Silicon Valley firm’s younger units.
But Pichai’s reveal that Google’s YouTube video streaming unit is generating ad revenue at a pace of $15 billion annually put it below rough estimates as high as $25 billion.
Divulging 53% quarterly revenue growth for Google’s cloud services compared with a year ago meant it grew slower than the business it is trying to catch up to, Microsoft Corp’s Azure. It reported a 62% quarterly rise in sales last week, or 39% when considering some cloud services Microsoft sells through other units.
While financial analysts applauded the new transparency from Alphabet, some questioned executives for the second time in the last four quarters to explain why overall revenue has been missing or just barely meeting their expectations. Sales growth dipped below 20% in three quarters during 2019, compared to just once in the previous three years.
Alphabet has blamed currency exchange rates and its constant tweaking of features, saying that it is not focused on quarterly marks.
“We continue to be very focused on the benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience,” Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat responded to an analyst. “But there will be variability over time because we’re very focused on what’s in the right long-term interest.”
Shares of the company fell about 4.5% in extended trading to $1,416.
“The stock was priced for perfection, and a top-line miss was enough to send it lower,” said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. “YouTube was impressive at $15 billion for the year, Cloud less so at $8.9 billion.”
Other financial analysts said YouTube’s ad revenue was underwhelming too.
“YouTube is smaller than generally assumed, but on the flipside, search seems to have accelerated and is growing faster than feared,” said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities.
Google through its namesake search engine as well as properties such as YouTube has been the web’s biggest draw for advertisers for a decade, enabling it last month to become the fourth listed company to top $1 trillion in market capitalization.
But new concerns have emerged among investors about whether its dominance will last as U.S. antitrust regulators investigate Google and as Amazon and Facebook Inc continue to grow their ads businesses globally. Both beat analysts’ expectations last week.
Alphabet’s overall sales in the fourth quarter were $46.08 billion, up 17%, compared with an average estimate of $46.94 billion among financial analysts tracked by Refinitiv.
Google ad sales in the holiday shopping quarter were $37.93 billion, up 16.7% from the same period last year
Alphabet’s expenses have ballooned with hiring of thousands of salespeople, building of new data centers and marketing the Google brand through hardware and other ventures.
For the fourth quarter, Alphabet’s total costs and expenses rose 18.5% from a year ago to $36.809 billion.
Porat said hiring and infrastructure spending would accelerate in 2020.
Alphabet’s fourth-quarter profit was $10.67 billion, or $15.35 per share, compared with the analysts’ average estimate of $8.787 billion, or $12.53 per share.
Hardware sales fell in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago, Porat said. Results could suffer further from any protracted work stoppages in Asia as companies combat the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China, she said.
Google last week temporarily shut down all its offices in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan due to the coronavirus. It has thousands of engineers across the region, including a hardware engineering center in Taiwan.
YOUTUBE PREMIERE
In December, Google CEO Pichai gained the additional role of Alphabet CEO from Larry Page as he and fellow co-founder Sergey Brin stepped back even further from day-to-day management.
The new YouTube disclosures under Pichai showed ad revenue grew 31% compared with last year.
Pichai also said YouTube, which has 2 billion monthly users, generated about $750 million in subscription and other non-advertising revenue, but did not reveal a figure for the year-earlier period.
Pichai said YouTube had 20 million paid subscribers between YouTube’s Music and Premium ad-free viewing packages, and separately had 2 million paid subscribers for YouTube TV, which competes with Dish Network Corp’s Sling TV and Walt Disney Co’s Hulu to stream television online.
Amazon recently said it has 55 million music subscribers, while Apple Inc last year announced 60 million such subscribers. Sling had about 2.7 million subscribers as of last year, in line with estimates for Hulu.
Shares of Alphabet were up 28.1% in the last 12 months entering Monday, compared with 21.8% for Facebook shares, 23.5% for Amazon, 68.1% for Microsoft and 88.7% for Apple Inc .

As investor confidence has been steadily rising in recent days due to the positive signs from the government to promote the country’s sole secondary market, the Nepal Stock Exchange (Nepse) index has consequently been on a bullish trend since the last few weeks. Keeping with this trend the Nepse index surged by 1.60 per cent or 21.26 points to cross the threshold of 1,340 points after nearly 20 months to 1,346.64 points today.
The last time the index had closed at the 1,340-point mark was on May 17, 2018.
Share investors’ confidence can be attributed to numerous reasons including seasonal factors despite some problems of liquidity to invest in the secondary market. The share investors’ sentiment had earlier been boosted after Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada had hinted that the government would support the secondary market.
Radha Pokharel, chairperson of Nepal Puzibazar Laganikarta Sangh, said that the market had been on an upsurge due to the investors’ positive sentiment and confidence.
“The market is on a bullish run, hence investors are investing more money in the market.”
As a result, the sensitive index, which measures the performance of class ‘A’ stocks, today rose by 1.77 per cent or 4.99 points to 286.75 points.
The float index that measures the performance of shares actually traded also went up by 1.69 per cent or 1.59 points to 95.65 points.
Apart from trading and life insurance subgroups, all the sub-indices witnessed gains today.
Among the gainers, one subgroup increased by more than two per cent and four ascended by more than one per cent with the remaining gainers rising by less than one per cent.
Banking — subgroup with the highest weightage in the stock market — soared by 2.35 per cent or 27.04 points to 1,175.96 points. It was followed by manufacturing, which advanced by 1.94 per cent or 47.78 points to 2,513.93 points.
Meanwhile, non-life insurance went up by 1.72 per cent or 101.52 points to 6,002.96 points. Likewise, development banks subgroup increased by 1.59 per cent or 28.32 points to 1,809.78 points and microfinance subgroup rose by one per cent or 22.13 points to 2,229.70 points.
However, trading subgroup shed 0.08 per cent or 0.62 point to 785.91 points and life insurance dropped by 0.01 per cent or 1.09 points to 7,557.44 points.
Altogether, 5.35 million shares of 175 companies were traded through 20,635 transactions that amounted to Rs 2.07 billion today.
Grameen Bikas Laghubitta Bittiya Sanstha saw the highest gain with its share price rising by 9.93 per cent to close at Rs 498. Similarly, Naya Nepal Laghubitta Bikas Bank’s share also surged by 9.89 per cent to Rs 789 and Mithila Laghubitta Bittiya Sanstha went up by 9.88 per cent to close at Rs 801.
Among the top losers were Guheshwori Merchant Bank and Finance whose share price fell by 5.03 per cent to Rs 132 and Synergy Power Development that dropped by 4.72 per cent to Rs 101.

The Indian government through its budget for next fiscal year 2020-21 has allocated INR 7.5 billion (Rs 12 billion) to finalise the detailed project report (DPR) of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project (PMP) and also to prepare DPR of the Sapta Koshi High Dam project.
As per the Union Budget of India, the DPR of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project will be finalised through joint efforts in coordination with the government of Nepal. It also states that preparatory works to prepare the DPR of the Sapta Koshi High Dam and Sub-Koshi Diversion Project will also be expedited.
The budget has stated that it will also cover the Sunkoshi-Marin Diversion Project, which is being developed for flood control purposes.
It has said that due to the annual floods caused by various rivers flowing from Nepal, the Sapta Koshi High Dam project and Sunkoshi-Marin Diversion Project will help to reduce the damage caused by floods and river erosion in selected river catchments.
On December 1 last year, highlevel officials from both countries had agreed to extend the tenure of the team of experts of the PMP by one year to December 2020 to finalise the DPR of the PMP. The DPR of the project has already been prepared by Water and Power Consultancy Services (WAPCOS) Ltd, an undertaking of the Indian government.
However, both the governments are yet to endorse it due to the issue of downstream benefits.
Both Nepal and India have agreed to give life to the 4,800-megawatt capacity multipurpose project, to be constructed on the Mahakali River of the Far-Western Province of Nepal along the India border.
The Pancheshwar Development Authority, which has been assigned the responsibility for the construction of the project, however, has yet to finalise the necessary policy documents, final bylaws, administration policy and human resources policy of the project development agreement.
The Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project was conceived under the Mahakali Treaty between Nepal and India in 1996. Apart from generating electricity, the project will provide irrigation facility to 0.13 million hectares of land in Nepal and 0.24 million hectares of land in India, in addition to other incidental benefits, including flood protection.
Meanwhile, on July 27 last year, government officials from Nepal and India held a meeting to discuss the problems created by the Koshi River, and proposed Koshi High Dam and Sunkoshi-Marin Diversion Multipurpose Project. But, the 16th meeting of the joint team of experts was not able to make any concrete decision regarding the DPR of the project, among other issues.
However, the meeting had reviewed the progress made in areas of environmental impact assessment studies, resettlement and rehabilitation plan, Glacier Lake Outburst Flood studies, power potential studies, power system and power evacuation studies and drilling activities at Koshi High Dam site.
The ambitious multi-billion dollar project will provide irrigation facilities, control floods and generate 3,000 megawatts of electricity.

Private telecom company, Ncell, has said that it will pay its outstanding capital gains tax (CGT) liabilities by June.
Ncell, which has already paid Rs 4.5 billion out of Rs 22.4 billion remaining CGT liability determined by the Large Taxpayers’ Office (LTO), has asked for permission to allow the company to clear its remaining tax liabilities in four instalments within June, informed Revenue Secretary Sishir Kumar Dhungana at the meeting of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Parliament held today.
As per him, Ncell has sent a letter stating that it will pay Rs 4.54 billion each by the end of March, April, May and June.
However, Dhungana said that the LTO is yet to respond to Ncell’s letter that sought the instalment facility. “Ncell is already delaying the tax clearance process. The company will be levied 15 per cent interest per annum on the pending tax amount that it should clear,” he informed.
Following the verdict of the Supreme Court (SC), which determined Rs 22.44 billion as the remaining CGT liability of Ncell, the LTO had given the company an ultimatum to pay Rs 22.6 billion (including interest) on December 23.
As the Ncell CGT controversy is also being dealt with by an international tribunal, which had ordered the government to halt CGT collection from Ncell, the telecom company had been in a dilemma about whether or not to pay the tax.
However, by depositing Rs 4.5 billion as CGT today, the telecom company has started complying with the SC verdict and the LTO direction.
At the meeting lawmakers also asked the government not to allow Ncell to use the additional frequency that the company won through spectrum auction held on December 19. Nepal Telecommunications Authority has not awarded the 9Mhz frequency that Ncell won in the 1800Mhz band asking Ncell first to clear its CGT liability.

The country’s trade with China has been halted completely following the closure of the Rasuwagadi border — the major trade point between the two nations — due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The government shut Rasuwagadi border on January 28 to prevent the spread of coronavirus after the number of infections in China soared. As a result, Nepal-China trade has been completely halted.
China is Nepal’s second largest trading partner after India. While Nepal exported goods worth Rs 863 million to China in the first five months of the current fiscal, the country imported goods worth Rs 88.6 billion from the northern neighbour during the same period.
Nepal primarily exports handicraft goods to China and imports ready-made garments, footwear products, chemical fertilisers, electrical goods, machinery parts, pipes, raw silk, telecommunication equipment and television equipment and parts from China.
“Hundreds of Nepal-bound containers have been stalled in parts of China following the closure of the entry point. Nepal-China trade is certain to be affected as China copes with the outbreak of coronavirus,” said Kamalesh Agrawal, vice-president of Nepal Chamber of Commerce.
Trade with China will resume only after the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control, but nobody knows when that will happen. Agrawal added that the market would soon start facing shortage of Chinese goods and there were also chances of Chinese goods becoming dearer. “We hope the coronavirus outbreak is controlled soon and international trade with China becomes normal,” he added.
Meanwhile, the price of Chinese garlic has already skyrocketed in the domestic market following a halt in its import from China. The domestic market largely depends on Chinese garlic. The halt in supply has resulted in more than twofold rise in the price of garlic over the past one week. Though Chinese garlic was available at around Rs 300 per kg in the domestic market a week ago its retail price went past Rs 600 per kg today.
Officials at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies said nothing could be done at the moment to address the current halt in trade between Nepal and China with the northern neighbour adopting precautions to cope with the coronavirus outbreak. “We’ll closely monitor the domestic market to ensure that prices of Chinese goods are not hiked arbitrarily,” Nabaraj Dhakal, joint secretary at MoICS, told THT.

According to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association (FeNeGoSiDA), gold was traded at Rs 75,500 per tola on Sunday and went up by Rs 500 a tola to reach Rs 76,000 per tola on Monday.
The price remained constant on Tuesday. Although on Wednesday, the bullion price declined by Rs 400 a tola to Rs 75,600 per tola, the price of the precious yellow metal went up by Rs 700 a tola on Thursday to be traded at Rs 76,300 per tola in the domestic market. However, on Friday gold price declined by Rs 300 a tola to close the trading week at Rs 76,000 per tola.
Gold price increased by Rs 800 a tola during the review period compared to the closing rate of Rs 75,200 per tola in the previous week.
Meanwhile, silver price declined slightly in review week.
According to FeNeGoSiDA, silver was priced at Rs 895 a tola on Sunday and went up by five rupees per tola on Monday to be traded at Rs 900 per tola.
However, on Tuesday silver wiped out the gain of the previous day as it declined by five rupees a tola to Rs 895 per tola.
On Wednesday, price of the grey metal slumped by Rs 25 a tola to Rs 870 per tola. However, its price rose by Rs 10 a tola each day on Thursday and Friday to close week at Rs 890 per tola.
Compared to its closing rate of Rs 885 a tola in the previous week, silver price rose by five rupees per tola in the review week.
As per FeNeGoSiDA, along with the panic regarding novel coronavirus epidemic, rebirth of tensions between Iran and the United States increased the appeal of the bullion in the review week. Likewise, the strengthening of the US dollar also affected gold price in the domestic market.
In the meantime, Reuters reported that gold prices rose on Friday and were heading for their best month in five as worries over economic growth due to the fast-spreading coronavirus boosted appetite for safe havens.

Himalayan News Service Kathmandu, February 1 Buddha Air, a private airline company of the country, has started its direct flights in Kathmandu-Rajbiraj sector from today.
With ATR 72 aircraft, the company has begun operating one daily flight in this sector. As a promotional fare, the airline has set ticket price at Rs 2,500 per person.
As per the company, the flight service will benefit passengers from Saptari, Udayapur, Siraha and Sunsari. Moreover, as Rajbiraj is also a significant place for religious and tourism activities, the company believes this flight operation will facilitate passengers travelling to nearby religious and tourist destinations via Rajbiraj airport.
Likewise, Rajbiraj is also quite near the border side areas of Saharsa, Supaul, Nirmali, Birpur, Raghopur, Pipara, Pratapganj and other destinations of India. Hence, the flight operation in this sector will enhance the travel convenience for tourists from both Nepal and India, Buddha Air stated.
Until now, only Shree Airlines was operating regular flights in the Kathmandu-Rajbiraj route. Earlier, Shree Airlines had halted the flights on this route citing low occupancy rate but had resumed the flights again.
Amid this, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) is renovating the Rajbiraj airport. CAAN recently completed the construction of a new terminal building at Rajbiraj airport, while the blacktopping of the runway is ongoing. It also plans to prepare a master plan for the development and expansion of the airport.
Meanwhile, Buddha Air is set to begin direct flights in Pokhara-Biratnagar route from February 3.
The company will operate three flights — Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays — in this route.
Buddha Air is now operating flights to Pokhara, Biratnagar, Bharatpur, Bhadrapur, Bhairahawa, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, Surkhet, Janakpur, Simara, Tumlingtar, Rajbiraj and mountain flights in the domestic sector.

KATHMANDU: At a time when the country is marking Visit Nepal Year 2020, stakeholders, experts, panellists, students convened in an interaction themed ‘Academia-Industry Interface on Tourism & Hospitality’ to discuss challenges and opportunities, in Kathmandu, on Friday.
With the motive of highlighting related issues to students, Nepal Academy of Tourism and Hotel Management (NATHM) organised the event today.
Speaking in two different sessions, guest speakers and panellists shed light on various issues and interacted with delegates from Pokhara, Chitwan, Kathmandu and others in the event.
Welcoming the guest and delegates, NATHM’s Executive Director Durga Dutta Dhakal said the interaction programme would help to forge a collaboration between academia and hospitality industry to usher development of human resources.
NATHM’s Deputy Head of Department Surya Kiran Shrestha highlighted challenges galore in the hospitality industry such as low salary at entry-level, brain drain, political interference during the recruitment process, low turnover and stressed the need of a paradigm shift in hospitality education.
Although Nepal produces at least 12,000 fresh graduates, a majority of them leave for foreign countries seeking jobs due to low employment opportunities in the country, Shrestha lamented.

Tourism expert and keynote speaker Ravi Jung Pandey said, “Interactive and collaborative mechanism should be established between the academia and hospitality sector. Pandey said this referring to the creation of a win-win situation for both the parties.
“Though regarded as a critical challenge to the hospitality-tourism education sector in Nepal, less has been suggested about the right path and strategy of cashing on partnership and aligning the benefit of both the academia and industry. Each of the above mentioned potential areas of avenues needs to be explored in detail to identify the nitty-gritty of Nepali tourism and developing the right strategy to make them work,” Pandey shared.
Likewise, speaking in the event, Nepal Association of Tour & Travel Agents (NATTA) President Achyut Guragain stressed on the conceptual as well as practical excellence of graduates and executives working in the sector for the sustainability of the industry. He also urged the concerned stakeholders to organise travel fair, travel mart to attract tourists rather than spending millions on advertisement abroad.
Addressing the event, Sreejana Rana, President of Hotel Association of Nepal and Executive Director of Hotel Annapurna, urged the government to implement the SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) from deluxe hotels to home-stays operating in the country to maintain the standard.
Rana further shared her experience of more than two decades in the industry, urging the young generations not to refrain from doing small things — from cleaning to picking up trash if they really wanted to succeed in the field.
“Going abroad for an internship is not a bad idea, but you should always stick to your roots to serve your culture and values to the customers after returning to Nepal. Every day is a new day and never stop learning,” Rana, first female executive director in the industry, shared.

Guest speaker Dorjje Sherpa, Managing Director of Gokarna Forest Resort, shared his two-decade wide experience in the hospitality industry and urged the academia to think beyond the traditional learning and teaching methods. He pointed out that time has come in Nepal to design curriculum focusing on value sharing rather than training them to offer service with a smile to guests.
Ghanshyam Upadhya, acting secretary of the tourism ministry, said, the government has given an emphasis on tourism development and the tourism policies are incorporated in the constitution.

During the event, a group of nine researchers from Bachelor of Travel and Tourism Management (BTTM) made a presentation of their recent interesting finding of ‘Sati Devi Trail/Route’ in Kathmandu.
Team member Sanjay Nepal said, referring to their team leader and mentor Dr Rajiv Dahal, “We knew about the Sati Devi Trail from Hindu myths and decided to explore Kathmandu valley to find a new and exciting trail to help pilgrims looking for spiritual attainment. Another team member Muna Aryal said the project is ongoing to reveal other facts about the trail. It is believed that Sati Devi’s remains fell on various areas in Kathmandu as Lord Shiva carried her for final rites.
During a panel discussion, students and delegates interacted with Digbijaya Koney, CEO Gandaki Treks and Expedition Pvt, Abishek Bikram Shah, MD Chandragiri Hills Pvt, Junu Maleku, Country Manager Cathay Pacific Airlines, Bipin Nepal, Chief Instructor at NATHM, Ashish Shrestha Co-founder Honey Guide App, Dr Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, Senior faculty member of MHM in NATHM.
Answering question put forth by one of the participants referring to low pay for fresh graduates and attraction to foreign lands, Abishek Bikram Shah said, “love your country, keep working hard and you will succeed one day.” He said, one doesn’t have to be extra-talented to succeed in life. “All you need is dedication, passion and confidence.”

Fellow panellist Junu Maleku urged the participants to keep alternatives if Plan A fails in life. Likewise, Bipin Nepal urged the students to be themselves and enjoy their work and life not expecting too much.
NATHM’s Bachelor in Hotel Management (BHM) coordinator and senior instructor Binod Aryal said, “Experts imparting their knowledge and experience would help the students to understand the real-world scenarios.”

The programme was organised on August 16 and 17 at Kanjirowa National Secondary School in collaboration with Robotics Association of Nepal (RAN) and Nepal Robotics Project, USA, according to a press release issued by the organiser.

The main aim of the training was to promote STEM — focusing on both the practical and theoretical aspects of robotics in Nepal, reads the statement. As many as 28 participants from 18 schools were involved in learning about the fundamentals of STEM education, drone making, aerodynamics, principles of flying, among others.
Kapil Dev Regmi, Chairman of Kanjirowa School, highlighted that Nepal’s education system required a practical approach to encourage the students for innovation and research rather than promoting rote learning. He was hopeful that such training will be given priority in more schools in future.
Participating teachers had an opportunity to interact with one another and share their experiences on the condition of STEM education in Nepal. The programme was led by some innovative engineers having extensive knowledge of robotics and latest technological advancements in the field.
Michael Kronmiller from Nepal Robotics Project, US, Aliyah Pandoliff from Kashmir World Foundation, US, and Prof Sandra Magnus, former NASA Scientist and Astronaut sent messages for the success of the programme and expressed their interests to work further with Kanjirowa in STEM education in the future too.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/education/government-bars-pupils-from-pursuing-non-academic-courses-abroad/,"Kathmandu, June 12
Nepali students, who wish to pursue non-academic courses, like vocational education or language courses in countries such as Australia and Japan, will not be allowed to do so from now onwards, thanks to the government’s radical move aimed at curtailing the rights of high school graduates to make choices. What’s more, students who have not completed Grade XII will not be allowed to study abroad.
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology published a notice today stating that students who have completed Grade XII or equivalent will be given ‘no objection letters’ to study abroad only if they intend to pursue academic courses of bachelor’s level or above.
Students cannot study abroad without obtaining ‘no objection letters’. These letters are also essential to get foreign currency exchange facility.

“We will issue no objection letters even to those who wish to pursue technical and vocational education, language courses and academic bridge courses, which are similar to language courses. But those students will have to provide evidence to substantiate they will get enrolled in a university to pursue academic courses after completing vocational or language courses,” said MoEST Under-secretary Maheshwor Sharma.
This move will largely affect students intending to study in Australia. Many Australia-bound Nepali students join technical and vocational institutions. This is common among those pursuing nursing.
Technical and vocational education, which is a non-academic course, generally prepares students for the job market, as it is designed by conducting studies on the needs of several industries. Countries such as Australia, Germany and Switzerland are well known for their technical and vocational education courses.
The latest move will also hit students who leave for Japan to pursue language courses. Many of them have not even passed Grade XII.
The latest provision introduced by the government clearly states that students will not be given permission to study abroad if they have not completed Grade XII. At present, not many students prefer to study abroad before passing Grade XII, but the new provision prevents parents who can afford to, or students who wish to, from doing so.
“The new provisions were introduced on the basis of the law which states that students can only get enrolled in foreign institutions if they intend to pursue higher education,” said Sharma. He added, “We now define higher education as tertiary education and not education attained in Grade XI and XII.” Earlier, the government used to define education provided in grades XI and XII as higher education. This has changed after the government started recognising grades XI and XII as a part of high school.
“The government should not have introduced such a provision without holding consultation with stakeholders. This blanket provision will not do good to students planning to study abroad. Students should be allowed to go abroad if they can attain quality education,” said Kedar Bhakta Mathema, former vice-chancellor of Tribhuvan University.

Loughlin, who starred in the television sitcom “Full House,” and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli filed papers in federal court in Boston waiving their personal appearances at an arraignment hearing and asking to have not guilty pleas entered on their behalf.
They are among 50 people accused of participating in a massive scheme that allowed wealthy parents to use cheating and $25 million in bribes to help their children secure spots at well-known universities like Yale, Georgetown and USC.
California college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer pleaded guilty in March to charges that helped parents facilitate cheating on college entrance exams and bribed coaches at universities to falsely present their children as athletic recruits.
Prosecutors allege that Loughlin (54) and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USC’s crew team, even though they did not row competitively, to help them gain admission.
Loughlin and Giannulli provided Singer photographs of their daughters in order to create fake athletic profiles for them, which a USC athletics official in exchange for bribes then used to support recruiting them, prosecutors said.
The couple and several other parents were originally charged in March with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Prosecutors secured an indictment on April 9 that included an additional charge of conspiring to commit money laundering.
Several other parents charged alongside Loughlin and Giannulli also filed papers seeking to waive appearing at an arraignment and have not guilty pleas entered for them. A federal magistrate judge granted their requests on Monday.
In all, 33 parents have been charged in the college admissions scandal. Of those, 13 have agreed to plead guilty, including “Desperate Housewives” TV star Felicity Huffman. She is scheduled to plead guilty on May 21.

ULYSSES, KANSAS: A 16-year-old Kansas boy will soon earn his high school diploma — and a few days later he’ll travel to Harvard to collect his bachelor’s degree.
Ulysses High School senior Braxton Moral will attend both commencement ceremonies in May, becoming the only student to successfully pursue a four-year high school degree and a bachelor’s degree from Harvard at the same time, The Hutchinson News reported .
Harvard has changed the rules, Braxton’s father Carlos Moral said, so his son will “the one and only” reaching that milestone. Braxton Moral will be 17 when he gets his diplomas.
Carlos Moral said they began to realize their son was special when he was in the third grade.
“They told us: ‘You need to do something. He’s not just gifted. He’s really, really gifted,’” he said.
Braxton Moral skipped the fourth grade.
The Ulysses school district allowed him to take some high school classes while he was still in middle school. Before high school he took a class offered at Fort Hays State University. Then he was admitted into Harvard.
Braxton Moral simultaneously studied at the high school and the Harvard Extension School. The program typically serves adults who work and can’t attend classes on campus full time.
Ulysses High School math teacher Patsy Love served as the proctor for the Harvard program, administering Moral’s tests in Kansas. Moral spent the summer before his junior year at Harvard’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
“We constantly are monitoring Braxton to make sure he is not too overwhelmed,” said Julie Moral, Braxton Moral’s mother. “No achievement is worth him being unhappy.”
Braxton Moral is on track to graduate from the Bachelor of Liberal Arts program, with a major government and a minor in English, said Harry Pierre, associate director of communications for Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education.

KATHMANDU: Mahendra Morang Adarsha Multiple Campus in Biratnagar is to provide re-totalling and college migration forms to students inside college premises.
The college agreed to provide the forms after a student lodged a complaint at ‘Hello Sarkaar’ section of the Prime Minister’s Office in Kathmandu, arguing that as the college did not provide re-totalling and migration forms, students were compelled to buy these from stationery where the owners denied them VAT bill.
The complaint was forwarded to Tribhuvan University with priority. It was later forwarded to the TU Office of the Controller of Examinations by Information and Public Relations Division of the University.
Consequently, all colleges in the eastern region of the country have been directed to ensure availability of the forms inside college premises. Joint Controller of Examinations, Arjun Bikram Khadka, shared this information.

KATHMANDU: First-of-its-kind internship and job placement fair has been organised in the capital by an engineering college, targeting fresh graduates.
Sagarmatha Engineering College (SEC) and its sister concern Sagarmatha College of Science And Technology, in collaboration with Zobfindr, organised the ‘Internship and Placement Fair’ with the theme ‘Sagarmatha – Institution to Industry’ in its college premises in Sanepa, Lalitpur, on November 17.
The event was organised targeting fresh graduates and eighth-semester students of IT and Engineering for internship and job placement.
Students of BE Civil, BE Computer, BE Electronics and Communication, and BSc CSIT from various colleges across the country received an opportunity of an on-the-spot interview for internship and job at a single venue. On-the-spot interview with top IT and engineering companies of Nepal was the main highlight of the event.
Dakshina Shrestha, Associate Professor and Head of Training and Placement Unit said, “The event was organised with an objective of helping students liaise with the industry and job market to make a smooth transition from college to corporate life. Many graduates were placed by online interviews. Overall, it was a win-win situation for both companies and graduates. The feedback we received was excellent. We were requested to organise such event every year.”
Sixteen of the leading Nepali companies working in the field of information technology and engineering like Javra Software, Leapfrog, Vianet, Karkhana, Fuse Machine, Wikimedians Nepal, among others had participated in the event.
One of the representatives from Javra Software, Technical Manager Dev Narayan said, “When I came here I expected a huge crowd, and students seeking jobs. That is what happened. I feel this is a good initiative taken by the college. I feel, definitely, a lot of engineers will be selected through the event.”
The event witnessed a participation of around 700 students.
Organisations working in related field like Malaya Foundation, Virinchi College, Himalayan College of Management, Sudreeshya Academy, Halftone Designs, Broadway, Start Technology, Sukrabar, and Way 360 had sponsored this open event.

BOSTON: The latest crop of US Rhodes scholars has more women than any other single class, and almost half of this year’s recipients of the prestigious scholarship to Oxford University in England are either immigrants or first-generation Americans, the Rhodes Trust announced Sunday.
Among the 32 winners is Harvard University senior Jin Park, the first recipient covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation.
Park, 22, of the New York City borough of Queens, arrived from South Korea with his parents when he was 7, studied molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, and founded a nonprofit to help undocumented students apply to college.
He hopes to become an immigrant advocate, saying it’s important for him to use the opportunity to better others, not just himself.
“When you grow up as an undocumented immigrant in America, that understanding that your talents don’t really belong to you in the traditional sense, that you have to share the fruits of your labor with others, that’s just something you learn,” Park said.
Alaleh Azhir, a 21-year old senior at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, emigrated from Iran when she was 14 — and is also one of 21 female scholars named Sunday. The New York City resident hopes eventually to become a doctor and will study women’s and reproductive health at Oxford.
“I’m just a passionate advocate for women in general and that’s mostly because of my background,” she said. “I thought that the way I could advocate for women could be by advocating for their health.”
At Chapman University in Southern California, Vidal Arroyo, 21, reflected on his unlikely path to becoming his school’s first Rhodes Scholar.
“As a Latino, a first-generation college student, and a train commuter to college, winning this scholarship means so much to me because it sheds hope for students from backgrounds like my own who have to overcome multiple barriers in pursuit of a higher education and a better future,” said Arroyo, who plans to study engineering science at Oxford.
And Eren Orbey, a 23-year-old senior at Yale University in Connecticut, whose parents emigrated from Turkey, hopes studying at Oxford will bring greater “context and clarity” to his writing. He is a regular contributor to The New Yorker magazine and is working on a book about his father, who was slain in Ankara when he was just 3, and the killer.
“I’m interested in studying the ethics of revenge and forgiveness,” Orbey said Sunday by email. “I think that our culture and media coverage often condescend to immigrants and survivors of trauma. In my writing, I hope to recast tragedy and strife as occasions for growth and heroism.”
The US Rhodes scholars join a separate, international group of scholars representing more than 60 countries.
Rhodes Scholarships provide all expenses for at least two years of study at Oxford. They were created in 1902 in the will of Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman and Oxford alum who was a prime minister of the Cape Colony in present-day South Africa.

LONDON: Football legend David Beckham has visited Indonesia – where one in three children have been physically attacked in school – to see how his charity, the 7 Fund, is combating bullying.
The A-list celebrity and former England captain launched the fund to protect the world’s most vulnerable youngsters in 2015 with the United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF).
“I feel very proud to see how my 7 Fund is helping UNICEF tackle bullying and violence in schools in Indonesia, and is ultimately keeping children, especially girls, safe in their schools so they can continue their education,” he said.
Bullying and violence are among the biggest worries for young people in Indonesia, with more than 1 in 5 teens aged 13 to 15 – or 18 million students – experiencing it, leading to mental health problems and school dropouts, UNICEF said.
The 7 Fund teaches children who have been bullied and former bullies to educate others and trains teachers to keep children safe. Bullying has been reduced by almost a third among the 7,000 children who have taken part in pilot programmes, it said.
“I spent time with an amazing young girl – Sripun – who was voted by her peers to take part in an anti-bullying programme to help stop violence in schools,” Beckham said in a statement.
“This has increased her confidence and she’s hopeful that other students won’t have to go through the same bullying experience she did.”
The fund — named after Beckham’s lucky number on his England and Manchester United shirts — focuses on children at risk of violence, abuse or disease.
Beckham, a father of four, has said that he hopes his own children will be proud of his work with the 7 Fund, which also has projects in Indonesia, Nepal, Uganda and El Salvador.

Speaking at the 18th Annual General Meeting of Educational Journalist Group here today, he said the government had to give priority to education.
“The quality of education should be improved now that the local levels are responsible for handling and managing school education,” he said.
Around 40 per cent of budget is being sent to the local levels and preparations are also on to hand over different projects currently being handled by different non-governmental organisations to the local levels.
Similarly, former education minister Dhaniram Paudel said despite the handover of the education system to the local levels, the Ministry of Education, Department of Education and district education offices should handle the education system.
Madhu Prasad Regmi, secretary at the Ministry of Education, said 23 responsibilities of the education sector had been given to the local levels without hampering the educational system.
As all the basic and secondary schools are being handled by the local levels it will be easy to manage resources for the education sector from local resources, he added.

Kathmandu
Teachers are guides for students providing students with valuable knowledge, which help students to excel in their studies as well as life in general. Teachers with decades of teaching experience in various colleges share important tips.

Study on a regular basis
Teachers suggest that students should give regular time to their studies. However, they say there is no fixed hours that they should set aside.
“Regular reading is a must,” says Bharat Kumar Bhattarai, who has 30 years of experience as a Nepali lecturer. He suggests students to prepare notes right from the beginning of the academic year and go through it regularly.
Saroj Pyakurel, Accounting lecturer in different colleges in Kathmandu, says that there is no fixed hours that students should give to their studies. However, according to Pya-kurel, who has 14 years of teaching experience, students should give as much time as they can daily, in which they would be able to understand the lessons taught every day. “Students themselves should decide how much time they should give regularly on a daily basis so they understand the lessons,” he suggests. He stresses that during holidays too, students should set aside at least three hours for revisions.
Educationist Prof Dr Bidya Nath Koirala says that the time students should give to their studies depends upon their nature. Some students learn fast and some slowly, so students themselves should find out how much time they should give to their studies according to their learning ability.

Tips for exam preparation
Educators suggest that students should go through all the topics of a subject in order to obtain good marks in exams.  Nepali lecturer Bhattarai suggests students to divide time according to the importance and marks of the topics. “For the exams you should not study selecting a few topics, but study all the topics in the text with the intention to understand each topic thoroughly.”
He says that students who select only few a topics to study for exams will not be able to do well. “Every topic in course is inter-related, and if students do not understand earlier topics, they will not be clear about the next chapter too,” he opines.
He also suggests students to prepare for exams by noting down important points of each chapter. Besides this, he says that students, who prepare notes from the beginning, will score good marks in exams as they will have already gained a deep knowledge of each chapter. However, he suggests avoiding using guides books and guess papers. “Students depending upon guide books and guess papers will ruin themselves,” he informs as “guide book writers are not responsible ones; they take it as a job and they are not responsible towards students’ progress.”

Be proactive
Students should not only depend upon the teachers’ notes but should also work on their own by studying reference materials, books from the library and doing online researches, as per the teachers.
“Teachers are limited within the circle of their knowledge and education, so students should also study and prepare from books by various writers. This will broaden their knowledge,” says Bhattarai.
Pyakurel also argues that students should not only depend upon their teachers and course books. “Students can benefit much from YouTube and Google as thousands of study materials are available there.”
He further says, “The mind is always motivated by desire, so students should also research on issues in which their interests lie.”

Questioning mind
Prof Dr Koirala says that raising questions is the most important feature of a learner. He says that students should always have questions in their mind and ask questions to themselves in order to learn. On any topic or issue, a student should ask questions: Why it is so? How did it happen? What is the mechanism behind it? How is it related with me? Raising such questions will make a student understand topics analytically, he says.

Clear vision
Sociology lecturer Uttam Prasad Devkota says that students should have a goal. Devkota has 13 years of experience in teaching.  “It is not that you study BBA because you completed your plus two level. Students should have a clear vision about their field of interest and about what they want to be in future,” points out Devkota. He adds that the students should not be limited to their course but should broaden their horizon by gaining knowledge on social, cultural, political and economic conditions of the country and people. Students should always notice what is happening in their society and country. This will make them explore the possibility of the current subject they are studying. They should not only prepare to get good results in exams but think of study and learning as a regular process, Devkota adds.

For most students the best aspect of this festival is that it strengthens the bond between female members in society as they meet and share their feelings with each other. They add that the singing, dancing and the celebration part of the festival is what they enjoy the most.
Nisha Khatiwada, a resident of Kapan and a Vth semester student of Bachelor of Public Health at the Karnali College of Health Sciences in Battisputali, says that it is fascinating to see women in red, dancing and singing folk songs on streets, going to temples in a holy and fasting mood.
Class environment
Rebecca Maghariya, a IVth year student of Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) at the Shanker Dev Campus in Putalisadak, says that as their college has no uniform, students come wearing red and green, or colourful kurta and also with mehendi on their hands two weeks prior to Teej. Maghariya is from Kailali and is currently residing in Thankot.
Maghariya’s classmate Pratiksha Gautam says Teej becomes a subject of all talks among classmates. Gautam hails from Rukum and is residing in Dillibazar. According to her, kind of clothes to wear and songs to sing during Teej become the main topics of talk in class starting a few weeks before the festival.
Effects on study
The students also admit they are distracted from their studies during the festival due to many reasons.
Neeru Poudel, a IVth Year BBS student at Shanker Dev Campus, says that the festival affected her when she was studying in BBS Ist Year as the board exam was on the same day. She was distracted from her studies as there was a celebratory environment at her home. According to her, this year too the BBS Ist Year board exams were scheduled on Teej but was postponed due to floods in Tarai. Poudel is from Syangja and residing in New Baneshwor. She says that music and other noise from Darr events at a nearby complex could be heard from her room. This disturbs her while doing her college assignments.
Umesh Bhakt Joshi, a IInd Year student of Bachelor of Law (LLB) at the Nepal Law Campus at Pradarshanimarg, says that around 50 per cent of female classmates in his class do not attend class from around two weeks prior to Teej. Joshi, from Bajhang and residing in Kirtipur, says almost all his female classmates are absent from Darr eating day till Rishi Panchami. He opines that as half the number of students remain absent, their lecturers show no interest in teaching and usually postpone classes for a week. There is also less possibility of female lecturers holding classes on those days, informs Joshi, adding that student unions in the college have organised Darr programme for students this year too as in previous years.
Shanta Bahadur Tamang of the Nepal Law Campus however, says that Teej celebration should not affect students regarding their studies as it depends upon students themselves on how to manage time. According to him, if some days are to be spent in celebrations, students should study those chapters early on or give extra time to the same after the festival ends.
Superstition
Apart from these aspects of Teej, Khatiwada said she does not believe bathing and performing other rituals on Rishi Panchami will purify women and earn them penance from the so-called mistakes they may have committed being and making others impure during periods. Such superstitions push women to an inferior position in society, she adds.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/best-picture-1917-is-big-winner-at-british-academy-awards/,"LONDON: Gut-wrenching World War I epic “1917” was the big winner at Sunday’s British Academy Film Awards, winning seven prizes including best picture and best director.
Sam Mendes’ drama about one of the most devastating conflicts in British history bested hotly tipped American contenders including “Joker,” “The Irishman” and “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” at a glitzy London event that was overshadowed by criticism of the nominees’ lack of diversity — even from some of the nominees themselves.

Director Mendes based “1917” on his grandfather’s wartime experiences. Shot in sinuous long takes that immerse viewers in the action, it follows two British soldiers on a perilous mission across No Man’s Land to try to avert a suicidal offensive.
“1917” was also named best British film and won the cinematography prize — Roger Deakins’ fifth win in that category. It also took trophies for production design, sound and visual effects.
Joaquin Phoenix was named best actor for superhero story “Joker,” which charts the origins of Batman’s ginning nemesis. Renee Zellweger won the best actress prize for the Judy Garland biopic “Judy.”
“Joker” took three awards — best actor, casting and score — from 11 nominations. Martin Scorsese’s mob drama “The Irishman” had 10 nominations but went home empty-handed.
Victory at the British awards, known as BAFTAs, is often a good predictor of success at Hollywood’s Academy Awards, being held this year on Feb 9. Like the Oscars, the British awards have struggled to become less male and white.
No women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running, and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.
Phoenix slammed the lack of diversity in his acceptance speech, saying it sent “a very clear message to people of color that ‘You’re not welcome here.'”
Awards organizers called it “disappointing” that there were no performers of color among the acting nominees, who are chosen by 6,500 academy members who work in the UK and international film industry.
The rising star award — the one trophy decided by the public — went to black British actor Micheal Ward.
British star Cynthia Erivo, who is Oscar-nominated for her performance as abolitionist Harriet Tubman in “Harriet” but was snubbed by Britain’s Academy, declined an invitation to perform at Sunday’s award ceremony in protest.
The British Academy has promised to review its voting procedures.
BAFTA chairwoman Pippa Harris said the problem was “an industry-wide issue.”
“It takes everyone to look at what they’re doing,” she said. “Awards are right at the end of a whole process, and so we need to look at the types of films being made, the opportunities that people are getting, how the films are being promoted. All of these things play a part.”
Presenting the best-director award, Australian actress Rebel Wilson quipped that she could never achieve what the nominees did: “I just don’t have the balls.”
Scarlett Johansson, a best-actress nominee for “Marriage Story,” said the lack of recognition for female directors was disappointing.
“So many women made great films this year,” she said. “And I think it just goes to show you that there is a systemic problem that is very prevalent.”
Hours before the event and several miles away, three people were wounded and a knifeman shot dead by police in what police called a terrorism-related attack. The BBC canceled plans to broadcast interviews from the red carpet on its news channel as a result.
Brad Pitt was named best supporting actor for “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” Quentin Tarantino’s bloody fairy tale of 1960s Los Angeles.
He didn’t attend, but sent a jokey acceptance speech, read out by his co-star Margot Robbie
“Hey Britain – heard you just became single. Welcome to the club,” he said — one of several references during the ceremony to the UK’s exit from the European Union, which became official on Friday.
Pitt also referenced recent tumult in Britain’s royal family, saying he was going to name the trophy Harry, “because he’s really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.”
Laura Dern was named best supporting actress for playing a take-no-prisoners divorce lawyer in “Marriage Story. She noted that her mother, Dianne Ladd, had won the exact same prize in 1975, when Dern was 6, for “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.”
Bong Joon-ho’s Korean-language drama “Parasite” was named best foreign-language film and also took the prize for best original screenplay.
Organizers set out to make the awards ceremony carbon neutral for the first time. The red carpet was made from recycled fibers. Instead of the goody bags of past years, guests will receive a “gifting wallet” made from recycled plastic and containing vouchers. The post-awards dinner featured sustainably sourced food, including a vegan option.
Stars walking the red carpet were encouraged to make “sustainable” fashion choices by wearing an outfit they already owned or renting one for the occasion.
Prince William — the British Academy’s president — and his wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, were the guests of honor at Sunday’s ceremony. William presented a BAFTA Fellowship, the academy’s top honor, to Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy.
“The Lord of the Rings” and “Planet of the Apes” star Andy Serkis — the maestro of motion-capture acting — was handed a prize for outstanding British contribution to cinema.
Falling two days after Britain left the European Union, the evening couldn’t avoid the subject of Brexit.
“We know it’s been a hard week for you guys and it’s very nice to take a little bit of your gold, back home — where it belongs,” joked New Zealand director Taika Waititi as he collected the best adapted screenplay prize for “Jojo Rabbit.”

The Writers Guild Awards were roughly a week before the Academy Awards, where both films will compete in the best picture category.
The “Parasite” win went to Bong Joon Ho, who is also the film’s director and Han Jin Won. Taika Waititi won for “Jojo Rabbit,” a film he also directed and starred in.
HBO swept the top television awards, winning the drama category for “Succession,” the comedy category for “Barry” and the best new series honor of “Watchmen.”
The premium cable network’s limited series also won the original long form prize, while FX’s “Fosse/Verdon” won the adapted long form award.
Saturday’s awards were handed out in concurrent ceremonies in New York and Beverly Hills, California.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/meghan-trainor-leaves-pain-behind-and-offers-fresh-new-music/,"NEW YORK: Four years ago, Meghan Trainor won the Grammy Award for best new artist. On the first anniversary of that very win she was literally speechless — under the knife for vocal surgery.
It was her second time in the operating room for vocal cord work and it led to weeks of silence, anxiety and depression. The “All About That Bass” singer worried she’d never be able to perform again.

“I went to a dark place. And I climbed out of it and I conquered it and I was really proud of myself,” she tells The Associated Press “My therapist was like, ‘You should treat yourself after what you went through.'”
So that’s why Trainor’s third album is called “Treat Myself,” a 15-track collection that sees the singer-songwriter stretch past her signature doo-wop pop sound to embrace hip-hop and electronic elements.
There’s the Sia-like “Wave,” the slinky club banger “Nice To Meet Ya” with Nicki Minaj and soaring ballads like “After You” alongside familiar retro and ’60s-inspired tunes like “No Excuses” and “Evil Twin.”
“I’ve always been writing songs in many genres,” she says. Her dad introduced her to gospel, soul and funk, like Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder. Mom leaned toward the pop of Madonna and ABBA. A Trinidadian uncle turned her on to soca music. She herself grew up with Brittney Spears and the Backstreet Boys.
“When I try to write, I try to give all my influences in that. I always want to make up a pretend genre — six different genres in one song,” she says.
Tommy Bruce, her manager, has watched as Trainor over the past three years has explored whatever musical inspiration strikes, not caring about labels or charts.
“She is such a wildly talented artist, from musicianship to songwriting to producing, and she has this ability to move between genre and style with such ease,” he says.
Listen very carefully to Trainor’s new album and you’ll discover it’s very much a family affair. Her brothers — Justin and Ryan — have writing credits and sing background. Her parents — Gary and Kelli — supply background vocals and claps. Even her husband, actor Daryl Sabara, sings on nine tracks.
“He’s my No. 1 fan, like legitimately,” she says of Sabara. “He plays my music all the time. I hear him blasting it in the car and when he’s in the shower. It’s just the best to feel so loved and supported like that by your husband.”
For this album, Trainor sought out new producers, which resulted in stretching her sound. She had success with Ricky Reed on the last album, “Thank You,” but says she felt too safe doing it again.
“I’m a creature of habit. When I found someone who understood how I worked, I thought, ‘This is great. Let’s do this forever.’ So for this album, I really wanted to get out there and meet as many songwriters and producers as I could.”
This time, some of the producers include Mike Sabath, Eddie Benjamin, King Henry, Ojivolta, Zach Skelton, Sigala, Tyler Johnson and Andrew Wells, purposely trying to lift up emerging talent. She also shared the microphone with Minaj, Nicole Scherzinger, AJ Mitchell, Lennon Stella, Sasha Sloan and Sabath.
“We felt like finally we have an album full of hit singles and I’m so confident in every song. We kept writing and saying, ‘May the best song win,'” she says. “Now we have this album that we’re finally read to show the world.”
Many of the songs have Trainor’s trademark messages of empowerment. “Love yourself,” she sings in “Babygirl.” On “Workin’ On It,” she admits to fighting thoughts of self-loathing: “I should give myself way more love.” And on “No Excuses,” she demands respect: “I don’t disrespect you, don’t you disrespect me.”
“It’s really hard to write a self-love, empowering anthem without being cheesy,” she says. “That’s something that the world loves and needs. I know I need it, and it’s something I want to hear on the radio. So those are my favorite songs to write because I’m working on it every single day — my confidence and my self love. I know somebody else needs it, too.”
The album also has a few inside jokes. It gives her a kick that the title ‘Treat Myself’ is her initials backward. And she has a call-back to her first big hit in “Genetics” when she sings “How you get dat bass?”
Trainor, who plans to tour with Maroon 5 this year, also has a side hustle as a musical judge. She spent two seasons on “The Four” and recently replaced Jennifer Hudson in the spinning chair at “The Voice UK.” For someone who’s been writing songs since she was 7, is it easy for an artist to shoot down another artist?
“It is weird, I’ll tell you that. The majority of the singers on ‘The Voice’ are way better singers than I am,” she says. “It was really difficult to be like, ‘Who’s the best of the best?’ and knowing we had 40 more people to listen to. It was a very difficult mission to accomplish.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-single-again-divorce-finalized/,"LOS ANGELES: Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are officially single.
Court records show that a Los Angeles judge on Tuesday finalized the divorce that ended the brief marriage of the 27-year-old American pop star and the 30-year-old Australian actor.
The couple separated and Hemsworth filed for divorce in August, about eight months after he and Cyrus married.
Hemsworth and Cyrus have no children, and neither sought spousal support. Documents cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.
In a statement announcing their separation, they said they were choosing to focus on themselves and their careers and would remain “dedicated parents to all of their animals they share.”
The “Wrecking Ball” singer and the “Hunger Games” actor spent sporadic stints as a couple for nearly a decade before they married in December 2018.
The day after Hemsworth filed for divorce, Cyrus denied on Twitter that her infidelity was the reason.
“I can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating,” Cyrus said in one of a series of tweets. “Liam and I have been together for a decade. I’ve said it before & it remains true, I love Liam and always will.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/nicki-minajs-brother-sentenced-to-25-years-to-life/,"MINEOLA: The brother of rapper Nicki Minaj was sentenced Monday to 25 years to life in prison for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl at his Long Island home.
A judge convicted Jelani Maraj of predatory sexual assault and child endangerment in November 2017. The victim testified during the trial that Maraj repeatedly raped her in 2015 while her mother was at work.
Prosecutors have said DNA evidence recovered from the girl’s pajama pants was linked to Maraj. The girl’s younger brother also testified at the trial that he witnessed one assault.
Maraj’s attorney appealed conviction in 2018, claiming that there was jury misconduct. The judge ruled in October that the defense did not meet the necessary burden of proof.
Maraj said in court Monday that he had an alcohol problem and asked for a “second chance.” One of his attorneys said he suffered from health issues including hypertension, gout and anemia and requested the minimum sentence of 10 years to life.
Maraj’s appellate attorney, Stephen Scaring, said he plans to appeal the judge’s decision.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/eilish-who-gives-voice-to-troubled-youth-tops-the-grammys/,"NEW YORK: Singer Billie Eilish, who gave voice to young people struggling with depression on a do-it-yourself album she made at home with her older brother, is atop the music world.
The 18-year-old made history at the Grammy Awards Sunday. Not only did she become the youngest person to win one of Grammy’s top awards — record, song and album of the year, and best new artist — Eilish is the first artist to sweep all four since Christopher Cross in 1981.
Her triumph came on a night made somber by the death of former Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant. It also ended a tumultuous week for the Recording Academy that included its ousted CEO accusing the Grammys nominations process of being rigged, and Diddy calling out the organization for not giving enough respect to R&B and hip-hop.
Eilish’s “When We all Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” also won best pop vocal album. Her brother Finneas O’Connell also won awards for engineering and producing the album.
“The music I listened to when I was growing up, maybe 7, 8, 9 or 10, 13, that was the most important music to me forever,” Finneas said backstage after the ceremony. “Anytime a person that age comes up to either one of us and says (it is their favorite), I know how much that means to them. That’s why it means so much to me. I hope they’re celebrating. This is all because of them.”
He said that they never thought that an album that addresses depression, suicidal thoughts and climate change would be up for a Grammy.
Eilish noted that they made the album in a bedroom of the Los Angeles-area home where they grew up in.
“It’s like anything is possible,” she said.
In accepting her awards, Eilish noted that she had grown up listening to many of the artists at the ceremony in Los Angeles’ Staples Center. She also said she thought Ariana Grande deserved album of the year, an onstage moment that recalled Adele saying the same thing about Beyoncé the same year Adele triumphed.
The success of a young, white girl came on a night the Recording Academy seemingly went out of its way to highlight diversity. Lizzo offered a powerhouse opening performance, and there were tributes to Prince and the late rapper Nipsey Hussle. Tyler, the Creator offered an incendiary version of “Earfquake” with Boyz II Men. Lil’ Nas X sang his omnipresent “Old Town Road.” Grande sang, as did HER, host Alicia Keys and Gary Clark Jr with the Roots.
Tyler, the Creator said later that the rap album Grammy was a backhanded compliment.
While he’s grateful to be acknowledged, “it also sucks whenever we, I mean guys that look like me, do anything that’s genre bending, they always put it in an urban rapper category,” he said. “I don’t like that urban word. It’s just a politically correct way to say the N-word to me.”
Earlier in the show, Keys sat at a piano to sing a rewrite of Lewis Capaldi’s song, “Someone You Loved” that name-checked many of the nominated artists but also included a few pointed lines about respect.
“I’m gonna be honest with y’all,” she said. “It’s been a helluva week.”
Keys also had the delicate task of addressing the shock of Bryant’s death in a helicopter crash, while onstage at the same arena where the former Laker won championships.
She sang “It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday” with Boyz II Men. References to Bryant abounded — a Lakers jersey held up by Run-DMC during their performance of “Walk This Way” with Aerosmith, and adorning a couch on a set where Lil Nas X began “Old Town Road.”
“We’re all feeling crazy sadness right now,” said Keys, who received praise online for how she handled it.
“Alicia, you’ve been lighting this awards show up,” rapper Common said onstage. “Thank you.”
Besides her big opening, Lizzo took home three Grammys, including best pop solo performance for “Truth Hurts” and two R&B awards. She also seemed noticeably affected by Bryant’s death.
“We need to continue to reach out,” she told her fellow artists. “This is the beginning of making music that moves people again.”
Clark’s pointed “This Land” also won for best rock song and rock performance, and he won a third for contemporary blues album.
Among the show’s more touching moments was Tyler, the Creator bringing his tearful mother onstage with him to accept his Grammy. Singer Demi Lovato made a comeback appearance after her reported overdose, singing a song she said was written in the troubled days before that event. Camila Cabello sang “First Man,” a song dedicated to her father, and received a bear hug from a sobbing dad when it was done.
DJ Khaled helped lead the emotional tribute to Hussle, the Los Angeles rapper who was gunned down in March, not long after attending his first Grammy ceremony as a nominee. On Sunday, Hussle won two posthumous Grammys.
Tyler, the Creator, Lizzo and, of course, Eilish were among the acts who won their first-ever Grammys. Other first-time winners included Tanya Tucker, J Cole, Lil Nas X, Billy Ray Cyrus, Michelle Obama, Sara Bareilles, Rosalía and 21 Savage.
Gospel legend Kirk Franklin received his 14th and 15th career Grammys.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/family-affair-billie-eilish-finneas-win-big-at-grammys-2/,"LOS ANGELES: The edgy, avant-pop album that siblings Billie Eilish and Finneas created in a small bedroom made a big splash at the 2020 Grammy Awards, winning 11 honours for the musical family.
“When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” — created in the musicians’ Los Angeles home — helped Eilish win the top four honours, including album, song and record of the year, along with best new artist. The 18-year-old is the youngest artist to achieve the feat and the first to do so since Christopher Cross did in 1981.

Finneas — who co-wrote, produced and engineered the album, walked away as Sunday’s top winner with six. Eilish won five honours.
“We didn’t write a speech for this because we didn’t make this album to win a Grammy. We didn’t think it would win anything ever. We wrote an album about depression and suicidal thoughts and climate change and being the bad guy — whatever that means — and we stand up here confused and grateful,” Finneas said onstage.
Together, they also won best pop vocal album, while Finneas’ individual honours included producer of the year (non-classical) and best engineered album (non-classical).
“This is my first Grammys. I never thought this would happen in my whole life,” Eilish said. “I genuinely wanna say I am so grateful and I only wanna say that I am so grateful.”
“This is to all the kids who are making music in the bedroom today — you’re going to get one of these,” Finneas added.
The bedroom where they created magic was brought to life when they hit the stage and performed “When the Party’s Over,” which featured Finneas on keys and Eilish singing in a soft, pitch perfect tone.
Los Angeles, where the show was held, had a central theme at the show Sunday: hometown heroes Nipsey Hussle and Kobe Bryant, a global icon, were honoured and celebrated at the show.
The Grammys kicked off with a performance in honour of Bryant, who died hours before the awards along with his daughter and seven others. And later in the show Hussle’s collaborators and friends, including DJ Khaled, John Legend, Meek Mill, Kirk Franklin, Roddy Ricch and YG, gave an all-star tribute to the man who died last year.
Hussle also posthumously won his first pair of Grammys on Sunday.
Filmmaker Ava DuVernay introduced the performance, which featured band players, background dancers and Legend wearing traditional Ethiopian and Eritrean clothing in honour of Hussle’s African roots. Mill performed a new song called “Letter to Nipsey” while others joined together for “Higher,” which won best rap/sung performance.
“This is for Nipsey Hussle. This is for hip-hop,” said DJ Khaled, who collaborated on the song with Legend and Hussle, whose family stood onstage.
“We all love him. We all miss him. It’s terrible that we had to lose him so early,” Legend said. “We’ve seen some tragedy today and last year … let’s hold each other tight.”
The show — which took place at the Staples Center, Bryant’s old stomping ground — began with a touching, emotional and a cappella performance of “It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday” by host Alicia Keys and Boyz II Men.
“Los Angeles, America and the world-wide world lost a hero,” Keys said, adding that the audience was “heartbroken in the house that Kobe Bryant built.”
“Right now Kobe and his daughter Gianna … are in our spirits, they’re in our hearts, they’re in prayers, they’re in this building,” she said. “Take a moment and hold them inside of you and share our strength and our support with their families.”
Before the show officially honoured Bryant, Lizzo performed the songs “Truth Hurts” and “Cuz I Love You,” saying at the top of the show: “Tonight is for Kobe.”
Lizzo won three honours, including best pop solo performance for “Truth Hurts” and two R&B awards.
“Hold on one second,” she said, catching her breath. “Thank you to the academy. This is really (expletive) sick.”
Lizzo was among the mix of newcomers and well-known acts who reached their goals of winning their first-ever Grammy Awards on Sunday, which also included Tanya Tucker, J. Cole, DJ Khaled, Eilish, Lil Nas X, Billy Ray Cyrus, Michelle Obama, Sara Bareilles, Rosalía, 21 Savage and Tyler, the Creator.
“To my mother, you did a great job raising this guy,” Tyler, who won best rap album, said to his mom, who was onstage and crying by side.
More crying took place Sunday.
Demi Lovato, who has mostly taken a break from the public since focusing on her recovery after reportedly overdosing in July 2018, gave a stirring, vocally top-notch performance that earned her a standing ovation. She was so emotional that she had to restart the song as a teardrop ran down her cheek.
Camila Cabello’s performance of “First Man” — a song dedicated to her father — also induced tears. Cabello walked off the stage to her dad’s seat to finish singing the song in front of him, while he teared up. Audience members were emotional, too, including Gwen Stefani.
Ariana Grande had a lengthy performance — probably to make up for the drama that surrounded her axed performance last year. Run DMC joined forces with Aerosmith to rock the Grammys stage, while Usher, Sheila E. and FKA twigs paid tribute to Prince.
Lil Nas X brought the story of “Old Town Road” to life by performing alongside the artists who helped the song stay at No. 1 for 19 weeks through various remixes, including BTS, Mason Ramsey, Diplo and the track’s main co-star, Billy Ray Cyrus.
Veteran rapper Nas then joined Lil Nas X for a new song, shouting out Bryant at the end: “Kobe, we love you.”
A dark cloud loomed over ceremony since the Recording Academy announced it had put its recently hired CEO, Deborah Dugan, on administrative leave for misconduct. Dugan and her lawyers fired back at the academy, claiming that the awards show is rigged.
But no mention of Dugan was directly made during the three-plus-hour show.

“Right now Kobe and his daughter Gianna … are in our spirits, they’re in our hearts, they’re in prayers, they’re in this building,” she said. “Take a moment and hold them inside of you and share our strength and our support with their families.”
Before the show officially honored Bryant, Lizzo performed the songs “Truth Hurts” and “Cuz I Love You,” saying at the top of the show: “Tonight is for Kobe.”
Lizzo won three honors Sunday, including best pop solo performance for “Truth Hurts” and two R&B awards.
“Hold on one second,” she said, catching her breathe. “Thank you to the academy. This is really (expletive) sick.”
Lizzo was among the mix of newcomers and well-known acts who reached their goals of winning their first-ever Grammy Awards on Sunday, which also included Tanya Tucker, J. Cole, DJ Khaled, Eilish, Lil Nas X, Billy Ray Cyrus, Michelle Obama, Sara Bareilles, Rosalía, 21 Savage and Tyler, the Creator.
“To my mother, you did a great job raising this guy,” Tyler, who won best rap album, said to his mom, who was onstage and crying by side.
More crying took place Sunday.
Demi Lovato, who has mostly taken a break from the public since focusing on her recovery after reportedly overdosing in July 2018, gave a stirring, vocally top-notch performance that earned her a standing ovation. She was so emotional that she had to restart the song as a teardrop ran down her cheek.
Camila Cabello’s performance of “First Man” — a song dedicated to her father — also induced tears. Cabello walked off the stage to her dad’s seat to finish singing him the song in front of him, while he teared up. Audience members were emotional, too, including Gwen Stefani.
Ariana Grande had a lengthy performance — probably to make up for the drama that surrounded her axed performance last year. Run DMC joined forces with Aerosmith to rock the Grammys stage, while Usher, Sheila E. and FKA twigs paid tribute to Prince.
Lil Nas X brought the story of “Old Town Road” to life by performing alongside the artists who helped the song stay at No. 1 for 19 weeks through various remixes, including BTS, Mason Ramsey, Diplo and the track’s main co-star, Billy Ray Cyrus.
Veteran rapper Nas then joined Lil Nas X for a new song, shouting out Bryant at the end: “Kobe, we love you.”
A dark cloud loomed over ceremony since the Recording Academy announced it had put its recently hired CEO, Deborah Dugan, on administrative leave for misconduct. Dugan and her lawyers fired back at the academy, claiming that the awards show is rigged.
But no mention of Dugan was directly made during the three-plus-hour show.

NEW YORK: Salma Hayek is apologizing for promoting a controversial new novel, Jeanine Cummins’ “American Dirt,” without actually reading it.
“American Dirt,” published Tuesday, tells the story of a Mexican woman and her 8-year-old son fleeing to the US border after numerous family members are murdered in drug cartel-related violence. The heavily publicized book has been praised by Stephen King and Ann Patchett among others and was chosen by Oprah Winfrey for her book club. On Saturday, it ranked No. 4 on Amazon.com’s bestseller list.
But numerous Mexican-American writers have called “American Dirt” an ill-informed narrative about Mexico that reinforces stereotypes. Cummins, a non-Mexican, even acknowledged in an author’s note that she had reservations about writing the novel. She has said she wanted to personalize the issue of immigration and be a “bridge” between different worlds.
Earlier this week, Hayek had posted a picture of herself on Instagram holding the book, and she praised Winfrey for “giving a voice to the voiceless & for loving harder in response to hate.” But after facing criticism online, the Mexican-American actress pulled back Friday, writing that she was unaware of any controversy.
“I thank all of you who caught me in the act of not doing my research, and for setting me straight, because that means you know me and gave me the benefit of the doubt,” she wrote, “I apologize for shouting out something without experiencing it or doing research on it.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/doubts-loom-over-nominating-process-for-grammy-awards/,"



LOS ANGELES: Questions have loomed for years around the nominations process for the Grammy Awards. But the doubts reached a new level this week after the Recording Academy’s just-ousted CEO claimed the show is rigged and full of conflicts of interest.
The academy, which puts on the 62nd Grammys on Sunday, says nominees are selected from contenders who are voted into the top 20 in each category. But some people view the voting process as less than transparent because the choice of finalists happens behind closed doors. That has stirred claims that members of key nominating committees promote projects they worked on or projects they favor based on personal relationships.

People have become more conscious of the idea that Grammys might be won “through all these nefarious, back-channel kinds of ways,” said Robert Thompson, a trustee professor of television and popular culture at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.
Deborah Dugan was fired only months into her job as head of the Recording Academy and recently filed an explosive complaint alleging that she was sexually harassed and that the music organization was a “boys club” that favors friends. The academy, which has accused Dugan of misconduct, said it launched an investigation.
At the 2018 Grammys, when Rapsody earned nominations for best rap album and best rap song, her producer, 9th Wonder, sat on the rap committee, and some argued that she would not have earned nominations without 9th Wonder’s influence. Q-Tip even publicly called out 9th Wonder that year since A Tribe Called Quest’s album did not earn any nominations.
A few years earlier, in 2014, producer Salaam Remi was part of the Grammy nominations process when a mostly unknown album he worked on — “New York: A Love Story” by actor-singer Mack Wilds — earned a nomination for best urban contemporary album.
This year, Lizzo was nominated in the R&B categories with album-filler songs — a move that some suspect was designed to help her become the most nominated act at the show. But it potentially took away from other R&B acts that outperformed her or had a stronger place in the genre’s culture during the voting period.
The Grammys also have a long history of keeping rap and contemporary R&B stars out of the top categories, rarely awarding them album, song or record of the year. Instead, the prizes go to a pop, rock or country act.
“I don’t even understand why anyone’s shocked at this point about anything,” Steve Stoute, the CEO and founder of the independent music distribution company United Masters, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “Do you need to see a videotape of unfair, inequitable ways in which they handle their businesses? Because it’s clear.”
Stoute, a former record label boss and advertising executive who has worked with Jay-Z and Mary J. Blige, has been vocal about the Grammys’ irrelevance for years, even taking out a full-page ad in the New York Times after Eminem and Justin Bieber lost top honors at the 2011 show.
He said the organization never learned how to change with the times. Although the award show itself is still “relevant and contemporary,” when it comes to voting “and the legacy and perspective on what’s art and what isn’t, they’re blatantly lost.”
Outside of the top four categories, the academy has formed several nomination review committees for specific genres to safeguard the music’s integrity and to serve as additional checks and balances.
Not all genres have such committees, though, and the rap category did not get one until the 2018 Grammys. The change allowed rising acts to earn nominations over veteran performers like Eminem and Kanye West, who seemed to get nominated no matter what they released. The committee was also in place to prevent embarrassing wins such as Macklemore & Ryan Lewis besting Kendrick Lamar for best rap album at the 2014 show.
Other embarrassing moments, like when the wrong film was mistakenly awarded best picture at the Oscars in 2017, contribute to suspicions that major artistic honors are “being run by a summer camp group or something like that,” Thompson said. “I think it makes people suspicious who are already cynical about some of these processes.”
The academy defended its voting process in a statement issued Thursday, insisting it operates “in a fair and ethical manner.”
Committee members’ names are kept secret “for the obvious reason of preventing lobbying from outside parties, therefore further protecting the integrity of the voting process,” the statement read. “Because these committee members are at the top of their craft, and many members work with multiple artists, it is not unusual that some of the people in each room will end up with nominations from the first round.”
If a committee member qualifies for a Grammy, that person is “required to leave the room for the entire listening session” and is not allowed to vote in that category, the academy said.
In 2018, the Grammys seemed set up to honor rap, R&B and Latin music — a response to heavy criticism the previous year, when Beyoncé’s pop culture juggernaut of an album, “Lemonade,” lost album of the year to Adele’s “25.” Adele’s recording was one of the best-selling albums of the last decade, though culturally, it did not move the needle like Beyoncé’s project.
So the top three categories focused on urban music and black and brown performers. Top nominees included Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino, Bruno Mars and Luis Fonsi, who shattered records with “Despacito.”
Some argued that Ed Sheeran, who had one of the year’s most successful songs with “Shape of You,” should have earned nominations. But had Sheeran earned a nomination, he might have easily won the award, taking away from the academy’s plan to award a rap or R&B performer. Mars, who released an R&B album that year though he was already a major pop star at the time, swept the top three categories.
Because of the constant drama, some critics say the awards are not as cherished as they once were.
“I think the value of a Grammy has diminished over the years greatly,” Stoute said. “However, I think the show itself, performing on the show, has value, and there’s still a group of artists that hope for the best. And some of us just really want it to change, but that door is closing.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/johnny-depp-jams-with-aerosmith-as-band-celebrates-50-year-career/,"
LOS ANGELES: Actor Johnny Depp and musician Alice Cooper joined Aerosmith on Friday at a gala dinner and performance in Los Angeles to celebrate the band’s 50-year career as one of the best-selling American hard rock bands of all times.
Cooper and Depp – who play with Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry in rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires – were among more than a dozen artists including the Foo Fighters, Sammy Hagar and John Legend who sang the band’s biggest hits as it was named the MusiCares person of the year.

Organized by the Recording Academy, the annual MusiCares event raised some $6 million on Friday for health services to members of the music industry.
Hosted by British comedian Russell Brand, the night was marked by jokes about the band’s drug-fueled past and the advancing age of frontman Steven Tyler, Perry, and guitarists Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton.
“It’s a miracle he’s still alive!” Brand said of Tyler, 71, calling him the “the sexiest septuagenarian in history.”
Aerosmith, formed in 1970 in Boston, rose to fame when the band broke through as America’s answer to the Rolling Stones with its fusion of hard rock and blues.
Tyler and Perry quickly earned the nickname “the Toxic Twins” due to their heavy use of drugs, a moniker cemented later in the band’s career by their numerous feuds and multiple trips to rehab.
Internal conflicts boiled over in 2009 after Tyler fell off the stage and his band mates threatened to hire a new singer to replace him.
“Should I, which I won’t, fall again, y’all might help me back up again, and I love you so much for that,” Tyler told the audience on Friday, praising the work of MusiCares.
Feuding flared again this week when drummer Joey Kramer lost a legal bid to play at the dinner after a period out through injury last year.
Kramer did, however, join his band mates on stage as they accepted their MusiCares awards, which also recognized Tyler’s Janie’s Fund charity for abused and neglected girls.
On Friday, R&B singer Legend got a standing ovation for his version of power ballad “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing,” while pop star Kesha gave an emotional rendition of the band’s song about child abuse, “Janie’s Got a Gun.”
Country singer LeAnn Rimes showed off her inner rock star on “Livin’ On the Edge,” while boy band the Jonas Brothers took on “Crazy,”
Previous MusiCares persons of the year include Dolly Parton, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Carole King and Elton John.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/sundance-festival-kicks-off-with-taylor-swift-crip-camp/,"
PARK CITY: Plenty of change is in the air at the Sundance Film Festival, where some 118 feature films are set to premiere over the next 10 days beginning Thursday.
Streaming companies are now among the most likely companies to scoop up buzzed-about breakthroughs. The marquee event of opening day will belong to a Netflix film: the feverishly anticipated Taylor Swift documentary “Miss Americana.” And for the first time in decades, the annual ski town festival is kicking off without a few opening words from its founder, Robert Redford.
Sundance is forgoing its traditional opening day press conference where Redford, the festival’s ever-sunny face, has presided since the 1980s. Last year, Redford made only a brief cameo at the press conference and said he would be stepping back. “We’re at a point where I can move on to a different place,” Redford said then.
Redford, 83, who last year also said he was withdrawing from acting, will still have a presence at Sundance. Aside from being on hand at the festival, he appears in two documentaries playing at Sundance, including one co-directed by his grandson, Dylan Redford.
Still, opening day won’t lack for star power. “Miss Americana” will bring Swift to the snowy streets of Park City in what’s sure to be one of the most frenzied debuts. Over the next week and a half, many more big names will be at Sundance, too, including Hillary Clinton (the subject of a new Hulu documentary series), Lin Manuel-Miranda (a subject in three documentaries at the festival), Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell (stars of the “Force Majeure” remake “Downhill”) and many more.
Discovery, though, is in many respects the main event at Sundance, where countless film distributors will be scouring theaters for the next big thing. Last year’s festival offered up many of the year’s most acclaimed dramas and documentaries, including “The Farewell,” “Honey Boy,” “Apollo 11,” “Clemency” and “American Factory.”
One documentary that may break out will also premiere Thursday. “Crip Camp,” directed by Jim LeBrecht and Nicole Newnham, begins with the story of a ramshackle summer camp for disabled teenagers in New York’s Catskills. But it expands to trace the history of the disability rights movement, illustrating how much of its spirit began at that camp. The film is the latest from Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company, Higher Ground.
John Cooper, the festival’s director, is also stepping down to transition into an emeritus director role. In his last Sundance festival as director, Cooper said he was thrilled to line up a good opening day slate of premieres. “It’s a very exciting and inviting opening day,” said Cooper. “It sets the tone for what people are going to do for the next 10 days.”
“Crip Camp,” too, is a Netflix film. In an interview, Cooper was unambiguous about the impact of streaming companies on independent film. Last year, Amazon made several high-priced acquisitions at Sundance (“Late Night,” “The Report”) that had modest runs in theaters. This year, even more are coming. Disney Plus has films at the festival. And WarnerMedia, ahead of the launch of HBO Max, will host a downtown lodge.
“The streamers are only good news for independent film,” said Cooper. “It’s only been in the last 10 years that everyone looked at the theatrical numbers as success for independent film. It was never considered to be even a possibility. There were exceptions to the rule and those became the norm that everyone has to live up to. With streaming, I think the number of eyes on these films is much, much higher.”
“We’re in a really good place for storytellers,” he added. “How they find audiences is the tricky part, but I think they are finding audiences more than they used to.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/rocker-ozzy-osbourne-announces-parkinsons-diagnosis/,"NEW YORK: Rocker Ozzy Osbourne says that he’s been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, a nervous system disorder that affects movement.
The 71-year-old Grammy winner and former vocalist for the metal band Black Sabbath said during an interview on “Good Morning America” that aired Tuesday that the diagnosis came after a fall last year.
Osbourne had to cancel tour dates last year due to health troubles. Osbourne said he really wants to get well and get back to performing because he misses his fans.
His wife, Sharon Osbourne, told GMA that the diagnosis “was not a death sentence by any stretch of the imagination,” but he had good days and bad days.
Osbourne and his family, including his children and wife, were the stars of their own reality show called “The Osbournes.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/parasite-wins-at-sag-awards-so-do-pitt-and-aniston/,"“Parasite” has officially infected Hollywood’s award season. Bong Joon Ho’s Korean class satire became the first foreign language film to take top honors from the Screen Actors Guild on Sunday, setting itself up as a legitimate best picture contender to the front-runner “1917” at next month’s Academy Awards.
The best ensemble win for “Parasite” came over the starry epics “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” and “The Irishman.” It was a surprise but only to a degree. “Parasite,” up for six Oscars including best picture, has emerged as perhaps the stiffest competition for Sam Mendes’ “1917,” which won at the highly predictive Producers Guild Awards on Saturday.

But “Parasite” was the clear crowd favorite Sunday at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, where even the cast’s appearance introducing the film drew a standing ovation. Yet until the SAG Awards, the many honors for “Parasite” have seldom included awards for its actors, none of whom were nominated for an Oscar.
“Although the title is ‘Parasite,’ I think the story is about coexistence and how we can all live together,” said Song Kang Ho, one of the film’s stars, through a translator.
Because actors make up the largest percentage of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, their picks are closely watched as an Academy Awards harbinger.
But the last two years, the SAG ensemble winner has not gone on to win best picture: “Black Panther” last year and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” in 2018. And this year’s front-runner, “1917,” more acclaimed for its technical acumen, wasn’t nominated by the screen actors.
If “Parasite” can pull off the upset at the Feb. 9 Oscars, it would be the first foreign language film to do so.
Before the win for “Parasite,” the SAG Awards were most notable as a reunion for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. They each took home awards and celebrated the other’s win.
Pitt is headed toward his first acting Academy Award for his supporting performance in “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” and he added to his front-runner status with a win from the actors’ guild. Along the way, his speeches have been full of one-liners and he didn’t disappoint Sunday. Pitt, who said he was nursing a flu, looked down at his award and said, “I’ve got to add this to my Tinder profile.”
He added: “Let’s be honest, it was a difficult part. A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn’t get on with his wife. It was a big stretch.” The audience laughed and clapped, including — as the cameras captured — Aniston, his ex-wife.
Aniston later won an award of her own for best female actor in a drama series for the Apple TV Plus show “The Morning Show.” “What!” she said upon reaching the stage. Aniston finished her speech with a shout-out to her “Murder Mystery” co-star Adam Sandler, whose performance in “Uncut Gems” has gone mostly unrewarded this season despite considerable acclaim.
“Your performance is extraordinary and your magic is real. I love you, buddy,” said Aniston.
Backstage, Pitt watched Aniston’s acceptance speech. After she got off stage, they warmly congratulated each other on their first individual SAG Awards.
Along with Pitt, all the Oscar favorites kept their momentum, including wins for Renee Zellweger (“Judy”), Joaquin Phoenix (“Joker”) and Laura Dern (“Marriage Story”).
As expected, Phoenix took best performance by a leading male actor. After individually praising each fellow nominee, Phoenix concluded with a nod to his Joker predecessor. “I’m standing here on the shoulders of my favorite actor, Heath Ledger,” said Phoenix.
Dern also further established herself as the best supporting actress favorite with a win from the actors guild. On her way to the stage, she hugged her father, Bruce Dern, part of the “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” ensemble.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge continued her awards sweep for “Fleabag,” a winner at the Emmys and the Golden Globes. Waller-Bridge added a SAG win for best female actor in a comedy series and took a moment to reflect on the show’s parade of accolades.
“This whole thing really has been a dream, and if I wake up tomorrow and discover it was just that, then thank you,” said Waller-Bridge. “It’s been the most beautiful dream.”
“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” also continued its streak, winning best comedy series ensemble for the second straight year, along with a win for Tony Shalhoub. But accepting the ensemble award, the show’s shocked Alex Borstein said she had voted for “Fleabag.”
“Honestly this makes no sense,’ said Borstein. “‘Fleabag’ is brilliant.’”
Robert De Niro was given the guild’s lifetime achievement award, an honor presented by Leonardo DiCaprio who, like De Niro, is a frequent leading man for Martin Scorsese. (The two co-star in Scorsese’s upcoming “Killers of the Flower Moon.”) A raucous standing ovation greeted the 76-year-old actor.
De Niro, a fiery critic of Donald Trump, referenced the president in his remarks.
“There’s right and there’s wrong. And there’s common sense and there’s abuse of power. As a citizen, I have as much right as anybody — an actor, an athlete, anybody else — to voice my opinion,” said De Niro. “And if I have a bigger voice because of my situation, I’m going to use it whenever I see a blatant abuse of power.”
“Game of Thrones” closed out its eight-season run with wins for Peter Dinklage for best male actor in a drama series and for best stunt ensemble work. “The Crown” took best ensemble in a drama series. And both “Fosse/Verdon” stars — Michelle Williams and Sam Rockwell — won for their performances in the miniseries.

Joaquin Phoenix, Renee Zellweger take lead acting prizes
Brad Pitt wins again
Apple TV+ notches win for Jennifer Aniston in ‘Morning Show’

LOS ANGELES: South Korean thriller “Parasite” was the upset winner at the Screen Actors Guild awards on Sunday, while Joaquin Phoenix and Renee Zellweger were named best actors, cementing their roles as frontrunners at the Oscars next month.

“Parasite,” the Korean language social satire about the wealth gap in South Korea, beat homegrown Hollywood movies with A-list casts “The Irishman” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” to take the top prize of best movie ensemble cast.
Winning the award, director Bong Joon Ho said it made him think that “maybe we haven’t created such a bad movie.”
“I am so honored to receive this award. I will never forget such a beautiful night,” he said through an interpreter.
The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, are closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actors form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Phoenix’s terrifying performance as a loner who finds fame through violence in “Joker” has swept awards season.
“I am standing on the shoulders of my favorite actor – Heath Ledger,” Phoenix said on Sunday, referring to the actor who won a posthumous Oscar in 2009 for his turn playing the comic book villain.
Zellweger, likewise, has picked up most of the prizes so far for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopic “Judy.”
Brad Pitt picked up another trophy for his supporting role as a charming stunt man in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” while Laura Dern was named best supporting actress for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Netflix domestic drama “Marriage Story.”
“It was a difficult part,” quipped Pitt of his role. “A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn’t get on with his wife. It was a big stretch,” he said to laughter, riffing on his own life as a twice-divorced Hollywood heartthrob.
DISAPPOINTING NIGHT FOR ‘IRISHMAN’
Sexual harassment drama “Bombshell” went into Sunday’s awards with a leading four nods but emerged empty-handed.
Martin Scorsese’s $170 million Netflix gangster movie “The Irishman” had another disappointing night, despite a cast that includes Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci.
Several of the contenders for best picture at the Oscars on Feb. 9 were not nominated for best movie cast ensemble at SAG.
Those left out include immersive World War One film “1917,” the big winner at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, as well as dark comic book story “Joker,” heart-wrenching divorce drama “Marriage Story,” and novel adaptation “Little Women.”
De Niro, whose lead performance in “The Irishman” has been snubbed by the Oscars, Golden Globes and SAG, was given a lifetime achievement award at the SAG dinner and used his speech to take a veiled shot at US President Donald Trump.
In television, Jennifer Aniston was an upset winner for her role as a TV anchor in “The Morning Show,” bringing the second award this year for the new Apple TV+ streaming service. Her co-star Billy Crudup won a Critics Choice award last week.
Aniston, in her first television role since the end of “Friends” 25 years ago, seemed visibly shocked.
“What?! Oh my gosh. This is so unbelievable,” she said.
Comedy “The Marvelous Mrs Maisel” and British royal drama “The Crown” took the prizes for their TV ensemble casts. But “Mrs Maisel” actress Alex Borstein said the comedy prize should have gone to quirky British comedy “Fleabag.”
Moments earlier, “Fleabag” creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge accepted the best television comedy actress statuette, capping a year of multiple awards for her and the show.
“This whole thing has been a dream and if I wake up tomorrow and find it’s been just that, thank you. It’s been the most beautiful dream,” Waller-Bridge said.

The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, are closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actors form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Sexual harassment drama “Bombshell” went into Sunday’s awards with a leading four nods for its story of how misconduct allegations by women in 2016 led to the ouster of Fox News network founder Roger Ailes. Ailes denied the multiple accusations from female staffers and died a year later.
Charlize Theron, who underwent hours in make-up to transform her appearance for her role as former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, is one of the favorites for best actress.
However, Rene Zellweger has picked up most of the prizes so far for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopic “Judy.” A win at SAG later on Sunday after a Golden Globe earlier this month will further boost her chances for a second Oscar next month.
Joaquin Phoenix, who played a terrifying loner in “Joker” and Adam Driver, who played a divorced father in “Marriage Story” are competing for best actor, along with Leonardo DiCaprio for the nostalgic “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.”
Several of the contenders for best picture at the Oscars on Feb. 9 were not nominated for the top prize of best movie cast ensemble at SAG.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/1917-takes-top-honour-at-the-producers-guild-awards/,"LOS ANGELES: If the Producers Guild Awards are a true predictor of the Oscars’ best film category, then the World War I film “1917” is poised to come away with the top honour in a few weeks.
The Sam Mendes film won the award for theatrical motion picture at the untelevised ceremony Saturday night at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. Many in the crowd seemed stunned after Reese Witherspoon announced the winner of the Darryl F Zanuck Award, which has gone on to win the best picture Oscar 21 out of 30 times — including the past two years, with “Green Book” and “The Shape of Water.”

“This film was inspired by my grandfather, Alfred Mendes, and my hope was to honor his experience,” said Mendes, who co-produced and directed the project. He also said it was his first time attending the awards, and thanked the guild for recognizing his film.
“This was best experience of my professional life,” he added.
Released late last month, “1917” has made a splash during awards season, including another surprise victory in the best drama picture category at the Golden Globes.
At the PGA awards, the war film bested other contenders like “Ford v Ferrari,” “The Irishman,” “Jojo Rabbit,” “Joker,” “Knives Out,” “Little Women,” “Marriage Story,” “Parasite” and “Once Upon a Time in … Hollywood.” “1917” has now built strong momentum heading into the Academy Awards on Feb. 9.
In other categories, “Toy Story 4” took home the animation award, “Fleabag” won the episodic comedy television award and “Chernobyl” collected best limited series.
“Producing a movie takes a village,” said “Toy Story 4” co-producer Mark Nielsen, while fellow producer Jonas Rivera stood beside him.
Multiple special honors were given out throughout the evening for production work including to Octavia Spencer, Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos, “Friends” co-creator Martha Kauffman, the film “Bombshell,” and Plan B Entertainment’s Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner.
“When I started off as an actor, I wondered about producers, ‘What the (expletive) do they do?'” Pitt jokingly said after accepting the David O Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures. Plan B has been behind “Moonlight” and “12 Years a Slave.”
“I’m now painfully aware of what you do,” he said. “I commend you all. Our job as producers are protectors, stewards. … Stewards of the story and protectors of the storytellers. And I find that to be an awesome responsibility.”
Spencer received the Visionary Award, struggling to deliver her acceptance speech through tears. The actress who starred in “The Help” and “Hidden Figures” said acting was her backup plan to being a producer, which was “the dream” for her.
“As an actor, I learned that my job was to find the truth in every scene and bring humanity to the characters I portray,” said Spencer, who runs the production company Orit Entertainment with Brian Clisham. Their company has produced the Apple TV Plus drama series “Truth Be Told,” and Spencer is starring in and producing an upcoming Netflix limited series about Madam CJ Walker.
“Now as a producer, I understand that Brian and I must maintain that insight with the movie and television series we develop,” she continued. “We look forward to adding fresh perspectives from diverse storytellers who enlighten, uplift and most importantly entertain.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/disney-dropping-the-fox-from-movie-studio-names/,"NEW YORK: Disney is dropping the word “Fox” from the movie studios it acquired as part of last year’s $71 billion purchase of Fox’s entertainment business, according to published reports.
Disney will still run them as separate studios within the company. But trade publication Variety reported that 20th Century Fox will become 20th Century Studios, while Fox Searchlight Pictures will be Searchlight Pictures. Variety said the studios’ logos are largely unchanged except for the removal of the Fox name.

Variety said the Fox name created brand confusion with Disney because Fox News and the Fox broadcast network are owned by Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corp, while the movie studios now belong to Disney.
The news outlet said a decision has yet to be made on Disney’s Fox television production businesses, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox 21 Television Studio.
Disney representatives did not return messages requesting comment.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/eminem-drops-surprise-album-advocates-changes-to-gun-laws/,"Rapper Eminem once again dropped a surprise album, releasing “Music to Be Murdered By” on Friday — along with a video that calls for changes to gun laws.
The follow-up to 2018’s “Kamikaze” — also released without warning — was announced on Twitter just after midnight.
The Detroit rapper’s new music video for “Darkness,” one of the album’s 20 tracks, depicts a shooting at a concert. The lyrics and storyline of the video specifically allude to the 2017 mass shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead, making it the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. It closes with audio and video footage of news broadcasts from other recent mass shooting around the U.S. and an appeal to register to vote.
“When will this end? When enough people care,” reads the text at the end of the video. “Register to vote at vote.gov. Make your voice heard and help change gun laws in America.”
A link to the music video on Eminem’s website encourages viewers to contact or visit several gun violence prevention organizations, including Everytown for Gun Safety and Sandy Hook Promise.
The cover art features blood spatter and a bearded Eminem clad in a suit and fedora and holding a shovel. An alternate cover features the same splatter, with a now hatless Eminem holding both a hatchet and a gun to his head in an homage to Alfred Hitchcock’s 1958 album of the same name: “Inspired by the master, Uncle Alfred!” Eminem tweeted.
“Music to Be Murdered By” is Eminem’s 11th studio album, according to his website.
Among many collaborators, the album features Ed Sheeran, Skylar Grey, Anderson .Paak and Juice WRLD, the 21-year-old rapper who died in December.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/priyanka-chopra-jonas-joining-amazons-spy-series-citadel/,"PASADENA: Priyanka Chopra Jonas will star opposite Richard Madden in the US edition of “Citadel,” a drama series to be produced in conjunction with programs from several other countries.
“The idea is to create a truly global, action-packed spy series,” Amazon Studios chief Jennifer Salke said. “It’s a totally innovative, multifaceted international approach to storytelling, and we can’t wait to tell you more as it comes together.”
Local-language productions are being done in Italy and India, with another announced Tuesday in Mexico. Amazon called the US version the “mothership” of the project, with production set to begin this summer.
Film star Chopra Jonas was in the ABC TV series “Quantico.” Madden starred in the award-winning BBC and Netflix series “Bodyguard.”
The other “Citadel” productions will “enhance the experience of engaging with the show,” Salke said. Further details and release dates were not announced.
Also announced by the streaming service during its presentation at a TV critics meeting:
— Meagan Good is among the stars of an upcoming Amazon comedy from “Girls Trip” creator Tracy Oliver.
The untitled, half-hour series revolves around four African American college friends in pursuit of their dreams, the streaming service said.
Good (“Star,” “Think Like a Man”) plays the “stylish, sunny” Camille, who teaches an anthropology course on sex and love at Columbia University. Also starring are Grace Byers (“Empire”), Jerrie Johnson (“Good Trouble”) and Shoniqua Shandai (“I Am the Night”).
Byers plays trust-fund baby and fashion designer Quinn; Shandai portrays aspiring singer Angie and Johnson plays Tye, described as “an alpha fierce, queer successful app developer.”
The series reunites Oliver with “Girls Trip” director Malcolm D. Lee, who will direct the first two episodes. Pharrell Williams is joining the show’s executive producers, which include Oliver and Amy Poehler,
— Amazon is touting the cast of a new “The Lord of the Rings” series as multi-generational actors “from around the globe,” including British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi and Australian actor-musician Tom Budge.
But the streaming service declined to say which characters — or the races — they or other cast members announced Tuesday will be playing. Other details of the production also are being kept under wraps but “everything is moving forward,” Salke said.
The series will “explore new storylines” preceding J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Fellowship of the Ring,” Amazon said.
Other actors in the series based on Tolkien’s works include Joseph Mawle, who played Benjen Stark on “Game of Thrones,” Morfydd Clark (“His Dark Materials”) and Ismael Cruz Cordova (“Ray Donovan,” Mary Queen of Scots”).

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/riding-globes-1917-ends-star-wars-box-office-reign/,"LOS ANGELES: It took the Great War to finally take down “Star Wars.”
Director Sam Mendes’ World War I story “1917” brought in $36.5 million in its first weekend of wide release, easily topping the box office and ending the three-week reign of “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” which brought in $15 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.

Universal’s expansion strategy worked beautifully for “1917,” as the film went from just 11 screens in its first two weeks to more than 3,400 on the weekend after it won Golden Globes for best director and best drama film, and just before Monday’s Academy Award nominations, where it’s likely to get nods in several categories.
“This is the blueprint for how to perfectly execute the platform release for a potential Oscar nominee and Oscar winner,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore.
While the epic wartime feel of “1917,” which was shot and edited to appear as though it was done in a single take, makes it a natural for major awards, its triumphs at the Golden Globes were a surprise over other dramas including “The Irishman” and “Marriage Story.”
“I hope this means that people will turn up and see this on the big screen, the way it was intended,” Mendes said at the Globes ceremony. Those hopes weren’t unfounded.
A good weekend was expected for the film, but it shot past those expectations.
“It’s the not like the kids were clamoring for a World War I trench drama,” Dergarabedian said. “A film like this could have easily slipped off the radar.”
With its previous two-week take, “1917” has now earned $39.2 million in the U.S. and Canada and over $60 million globally. That’s of course dwarfed by Disney’s total domestic take of $478.2 million for “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” which is on the verge of reaching $1 billion globally after four weeks.
“Jumanji: The Next Level” was in third place in its fifth week of release for Sony with earnings of $14 million, and has totaled more than $257 million domestically.
Sony has a smaller sort of hit in “Little Women,” which could also make a mark at Monday’s Oscar nominations and continues its strong run for a film of its kind, bringing in another $7.65 million to put it in the sixth spot with a total of $74 million after three weeks.
The usual January box-office blahs were in effect for the week’s new releases.
“Like a Boss,” Paramount’s comedy starring Tiffany Haddish and Rose Byrne, finished in a fourth-place tie at $10 million with “Just Mercy.”
“Underwater,” 20th Century Fox’s deep-sea adventure starring Kristen Stewart, brought in a tepid $7 million and finished below “Little Women.”
“For newcomers, this is usually not a bountiful time for the box office,” Dergarabedian said. “It’s usually about the holdovers and awards-season contenders.”
The tied-for-fourth $10 million finish was better news for Warner Bros.’ smaller-budgeted “Just Mercy,” which stars Michael B. Jordan in the true story of an attorney appealing a murder conviction, and like “1917” was expanded from just a few screens to a few thousand in its third weekend.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

“1917,” $36.5 million, ($19.9 million international).
“Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker,” $15.1 million, ($24.2 million international).
“Jumanji: The Next Level,” $14 million, ($22.6 million international).
“Like a Boss,” $10 million.
“Just Mercy,” $10 million.
“Little Women,” $7.65 million, ($8.1 million international).
“Underwater,” $7 million, ($7.1 million international).
“Frozen 2,” $5.76 million, ($19.1 million international).
“Knives Out,” $5.73 million, ($5.5 million international).
“Spies in Disguise,” $5.1 million, ($11.4 million international).

NEW YORK: Canadian pop superstar Justin Bieber revealed on Wednesday that he had been battling Lyme disease and a serious case of mononucleosis but said he was overcoming his health issues.
On Instagram, Bieber noted that some people had recently criticized his appearance and suggested he was using drugs.
“They failed to realize I’ve been recently diagnosed with Lyme disease, not only that but had a serious case of chronic mono which affected my skin, brain function, energy and overall health,” Bieber wrote.
“It’s been a rough couple of years but getting the right treatment that will help treat this so far incurable disease,” he added. “And I will be back and better than ever.”
Bieber, 25, said his health challenges were among the topics to be chronicled on an upcoming 10-episode documentary series about his life that will be released on YouTube starting on Jan. 27.
In the past year, Bieber has written a series of Instagram posts to his 124 million followers talking about his struggles with depression, drug abuse and fame and crediting religion and wife Hailey Baldwin for his recovery.
This year, Bieber plans to release his first album in several years and embark on a North American tour. He released a single called “Yummy” last week.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/brazil-judge-orders-netflix-to-remove-film-with-gay-jesus/,"RIO DE JANEIRO: A Brazilian judge on Wednesday ordered Netflix to stop showing a Christmas special that some called blasphemous for depicting Jesus as a gay man and which prompted a gasoline bomb attack on the satirists behind the program.
The ruling by Rio de Janeiro judge Benedicto Abicair responded to a petition by a Brazilian Catholic organization that argued the “honor of millions of Catholics” was hurt by the airing of “The First Temptation of Christ.” The special was produced by the Rio-based film company Porta dos Fundos, whose headquarters was targeted in the Christmas Eve attack.
Netflix told The Associated Press it would not comment on the ruling.
Porta dos Fundos also declined to comment on the judge’s decision, which contradicted an earlier decision rejecting censorship of the program. The ruling is valid until another court orders otherwise.
Abicair said the program’s withdrawal “is beneficial not only to the Christian community, but to Brazilian society which is mostly Christian.”
The ruling comes at a time when some civil groups say far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is waging a “cultural war,” cutting funding for arts projects that challenge “Christian values” and inveighing against flamboyant carnival celebrations.
Early on the day before Christmas, a group of hooded men attacked the headquarters of Porta dos Fundos with Molotov cocktails. No one was hurt. A video circulating days later on social media showed three men claiming responsibility for the attack.
The First Temptation of Christ depicts Jesus returning home on his 30th birthday and insinuates he is gay. Religious groups bristled at the depiction. Creators of the film have defended it as legitimate freedom of expression.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood-a-lister-backs-protesting-students-faces-boycott-calls/,"MUMBAI: A top Indian actress who joined students protesting against the government drew calls on social media on Wednesday for a boycott of her upcoming film, as well as praise for being a rare Bollywood A-lister to stand up against a crackdown on dissent.
Deepika Padukone stood silently behind students chanting anti-government slogans at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University on Tuesday evening, surprising many in a country where top film stars typically avoid politics.
Her act of solidarity came after masked men wielding sticks and rods stormed the JNU campus on Sunday, injuring some 30 people.
Students at JNU, regarded as a left-wing bastion, have protested for months against an announced fee hike as well as a new citizenship law, which critics say discriminates against Muslims and erodes India‘s secular constitution.
Students and some faculty blamed Sunday’s assault on a student union with ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. The student union has denied these allegations, blaming left-wing groups for the violence.
Pictures circulating online showing a solemn-faced Padukone standing behind an injured student leader, whose head was covered in a bandage, set off social media storm, raising calls for a boycott of her film “Chhapaak” (Splash), which is set to be released on Friday.
“#BoycottChhapaak” was Twitter’s top trending topic in India on Wednesday, with more than 350,000 tweets on the subject. The film is based on the true story of a woman who survived an acid attack and re-built her life.
“What a brazen & cheap tactic to promote a film!” wrote one Twitter user about Padukone.
“She chooses JNU where leftists who want to break India dominate!” tweeted another.
Some outspoken Bollywood figures lauded Padukone though, and vowed to support “Chhapaak.”
“Let’s all those who stand against the violence go to @bookmyshow and show them,” tweeted director Anurag Kashyap.
Padukone, who starred in the 2017 action film “xXx: Return of Xander Cage” with Vin Diesel, does not appear to have made any statement on Tuesday. She was not available for comment on Wednesday, her spokeswoman said.
The protests sweeping India in the last weeks have posed a dilemma for Bollywood, which has some big-name Muslim actors but is sensitive to the sentiments of the country’s Hindu majority.
“The reason why a whole lot of stars back away from making statements is because they are afraid of the consequences it will have on their films,” said brand consultant and columnist Santosh Desai. “To do this so close to a film is certainly risky.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/celebs-donate-millions-to-help-australia-wildfire-efforts/,"LOS ANGELES: Elton John and Chris Hemsworth are among the celebrities donating big bucks for relief efforts as wildfires engulf Australia.
Hemsworth, the Australian actor who plays Thor in the Marvel movie franchise, took to social media Monday to share that he will donate $1 million and asked his millions of followers to show support as well. He said that “every penny counts.”
So far, the wildfires have scorched an area twice the size of the U.S. state of Maryland. The blazes have killed 25 people and destroyed 2,000 homes. The fires, fueled by drought and the country’s hottest and driest year on record, have been raging since September, months earlier than is typical for Australia’s annual wildfire season.
John announced during his Farewell Yellow Brick Road concert in Sydney, Australia, that he will also donate $1 million. The singer said he wanted to bring attention to the devastation that wildfires have caused, saying it has reached a “biblical scale.”
Hemsworth and John join a growing list of celebrities who have pledged to donate toward relief efforts, including Nicole Kidman, Pink and Keith Urban.
“I am totally devastated watching what is happening in Australia right now with the horrific bushfires,” Pink wrote in a recent social media post. “I am pledging a donation of $500,000 directly to the local fire services that are battling so hard on the frontlines. My heart goes out to our friends and family in Oz.”
Metallica announced a donation on Tuesday night of $750,000 to a  firefighting agency  and  emergency services agency in Victoria.
An emotional Rose Byrne, who is Australian, spoke about the crisis and the relief efforts on Tuesday night at the New York premiere of her movie “Like a Boss.”
“Really what people need is just donations because it’s all volunteer based, the firefighters and all the rural services and the wildlife services trying to rescue the animals,” she told The Associated Press.
She added: “It’s devastating. It’s such a beautiful country. There’s always drought but this is the hottest year on record and they need rain but a lot of rain, not just a little bit which is what’s happening now. They need like a downpour, downpour and it’s just getting hotter and it’s getting more and more out of control. It’s a climate crisis is what it is.”
At the Golden Globes on Sunday, Phoebe Waller-Bridge said she would auction off her Globe outfit and have the proceeds go to firefighter relief.
Russell Crowe wasn’t at the Globes to accept his trophy for best actor in a limited series or TV movie for playing former Fox CEO Roger Ailes in the Showtime miniseries “The Loudest Voice.” Instead, the actor was in Australia trying to protect his home from the wildfires, sending a speech that Jennifer Aniston read.
“Make no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change-based,” Crowe’s statement said. “We need to act based on science, move our global workforce to renewable energy and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is. That way, we all have a future.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/tom-hanks-honored-with-lifetime-award-at-golden-globes/,"
BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA: Tom Hanks, regarded as one of the nicest men in show business, was honored with a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes on Sunday to mark his 30-year movie career.
The boyish-looking Hanks, now 63, was presented with the Cecil B DeMille award at a ceremony where he also was nominated in the best supporting actor race for his role as the late, beloved US children’s television presenter Mister Rogers in “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.”

Hanks began his acceptance speech by joking about his early career stint on the 1970s TV comedy “The Love Boat” and saying that he had a bad cold that had made him particularly emotional.
He thanked his wife, Rita Wilson, and five children before acknowledging a long list of actors and directors who he said had contributed to his long success.
“You’re a dope if you don’t steal from everybody you have every worked with,” Hanks said, naming Meryl Streep, Meg Ryan, Denzel Washington, and Charlize Theron, among others.
Hanks made his movie breakthrough in “Big” in 1988, playing a teenager who wakes up to find himself in the body of an adult.
He went on to win back-to-back Oscars and Golden Globes in 1994 and 1995 for his roles in AIDS drama “Philadelphia” and comedy “Forrest Gump.”
Genial and dependable, he has become known as “America’s Dad” thanks to performances in more than 70 movies, including romantic comedy “Sleepless in Seattle,” war movie “Saving Private Ryan,” action film “Sully” and the voice of friendly cowboy Woody in the “Toy Story” animated franchise.
Hanks attributed some of his success in the movies to a lesson he learned while working at a Shakespeare theater festival when he was a young actor: being on time.
“Showing up on time is one of the greatest liberating acts you can give yourself in a movie,” he said.
The Cecil B DeMille award is given annually by Golden Globe organizers the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to an actor, director or producer who has made a lasting impact on the film industry. Past recipients include Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep, Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Harrison Ford.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/1917-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-win-golden-globes/,"
The 77th Golden Globes were meant to be a coronation for Netflix. Instead, a pair of big-screen epics took top honors Sunday, as Sam Mendes’ technically dazzling World War I tale “1917” won best picture, drama, and Quentin Tarantino’s radiant Los Angeles fable “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” won best film, comedy or musical.
The wins for “1917” were a surprise, besting such favorites as Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” (the leading nominee with six nods) and Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman.” Both are acclaimed Netflix releases but they collectively took home just one award, for Laura Dern’s supporting performance as a divorce attorney in “Marriage Story.” “The Irishman” was entirely shut out.

“1917” also won best director for Mendes. The film was made in long takes, giving the impression of it unfolding in one lengthy shot.
“Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” had easier path than the more competitive drama category. Brad Pitt won for best supporting actor, his first acting Globe since winning 1996 for “12 Monkeys,” padding his front-runner status for the Oscars.
“I wanted to bring my mom, but I couldn’t because any woman I stand next to they say I am dating so it’d just be awkward,” said Pitt.
Ricky Gervais, hosting the NBC-telecast ceremony for the fifth time, began the evening with an expletive-laden plea against hypocrisy, telling winners to stick to thanking their agent and their god. But throughout the night, those who took the stage used the moment to speak on matters including the currently raging Australian wildfires, destabilization in Iran, women’s rights, the importance of LGBT trailblazers, and even, the importance of being on time.
Gervais also argued that Netflix had taken over Hollywood, given the streaming service’s commanding 34 nominations, in film and TV, coming into the Globes. But the awards were widely spread around among traditional Hollywood studios, indie labels like A24, cable heavyweights like HBO and relative newcomers like Hulu.
As always at the Globes, there were surprises. Mendes’ best director ‘prize bested the likes of Martin Scorsese (“The Irishman”), Tarantino and Bong Joon Ho (“Parasite”). The award was well-timed for “1917,” which expands nationwide Friday.
“There is not one director in the world that is not in the shadow of Martin Scorsese,” a plainly surprised Mendes said.
Awkwafina, the star of the hit indie family drama “The Farewell,” became the first woman of Asian descent to win best actress in a comedy or musical. “If anything, if I fall upon hard times, I can sell this,” said Awkwafina, holding the award.
No other category has been more competitive this year than best actor. On Sunday, Joaquin Phoenix won for his loose-limbed performance in the divisive but hugely popular “Joker” in a category that included Adam Driver (“Marriage Story”)
Gervais opened the 77th Golden Globes by declaring movies irrelevant, pretending to confuse Joe Pesci for Baby Yoda, calling the Hollywood Foreign Press Association racist and declaring Netflix’s takeover of Hollywood complete.
Gervais, who has a series on Netflix, said he could summarize the three-hour award show with a simple phrase: “Well done, Netflix. You win.” The streaming giant came into the Globes with a commanding 34 nods: 17 in film categories and 17 in television categories.
Hosting the Globes for the fifth, and according to him last time, Gervais was perhaps even more cutting than before. He told executives in the room that journalist Ronan Farrow, who has exposed cases of sexual misconduct, was coming for them. He said something vulgar that got bleeped about Judi Dench’s part in “Cats.” And most of all, he mocked Hollywood hypocrisy, skewering stars for working for companies like Apple, Amazon and the Walt Disney Co. while giving speeches urging social change.
“If ISIS started a streaming service, you’d call your agent,” Gervais told the starry crowd Sunday at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California.
Laura Dern, the best supporting actress front-runner for her performance as a divorce attorney in “Marriage Story,” won her fifth Globe. (Dern even served as Miss Golden Globe at age 15.) Her win denied Jennifer Lopez, the “Hustlers” star, her first major acting award.
The first award of the night went to a streaming service series. Ramy Youssef won best actor in a TV series comedy or musical for his Hulu show “Ramy.” Best actor in a limited series went to Russell Crowe for the Showtime series “The Loudest Voice.” He wasn’t in attendance because of raging wildfires in his native Australia.
“Make no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate-changed based,” Crowe said in a statement read by presenters Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.
Ahead of Sunday’s show, some wondered how much the rising tensions with Iran would be talked about following the United States’ targeted killing on Friday of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. That went unmentioned until more than halfway through when Patricia Arquette, a winner for her performance in Hulu’s “The Act,” said history wouldn’t remember the day for the Globes but will see “a country on the brink of war.” She urged all to vote in November’s presidential election.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge followed up her Emmy haul by winning best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series. She thanked former President Barack Obama for putting “Fleabag” on his best-of-2019 list. With a grin, she added: “As some of you may know, he’s always been on mine.”
Waller-Bridge’s co-star Andrew Scott (of “hot priest” fame) missed out on the category’s supporting actor award, which Stellan Skarsgård took for HBO’s “Chernobyl.”
HBO was also triumphant in best TV drama, where the second season of “Succession” bested Netflix’s “The Crown” and Apple TV Plus’ first Globe nominee, “The Morning Show.” Brian Cox, the Rupert Murdoch-like patriarch of “Succession,” also won best actor in a drama series. “The Crown” took some hardware home, too, with Olivia Colman winning best actress in a drama series, a year after winning for her performance in “The Favourite.”
Best foreign language film went to Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite,” the Cannes Palme d’Or winning sensation from South Korea. Despite being an organization of foreign journalists, the HFPA doesn’t include foreign films in its top categories, thus ruling out “Parasite,” a likely best picture nominee at next month’s Oscars.
“Once you overcome the inch-tall-barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,” said Bong through a translator.
Tom Hanks, also a nominee for his supporting turn as Fred Rogers in “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” received the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award. The Carol Burnett Award, a similar honorary award given for television accomplishment, was given to Ellen DeGeneres. She was movingly introduced by Kate McKinnon who said DeGeneres’ example guided her in her own coming out.
“The only thing that made it less scary was seeing Ellen on TV,” said McKinnon.
Hanks’ speech had its own emotional moment. Just as he was beginning comments that would touch on the importance of actors being on time, Hanks caught sight of his wife and four children at a table near the stage and choked up.
“A man is blessed with the family’s sitting down front like that,” said Hanks.
Elton John and Bernie Taupin won the evening’s most heavyweight battle, besting Beyonce and Taylor Swift. Their “I’m Gonna Love Me Again” won best song. “It’s the first time I’ve ever won an award with him,” said Elton of his song-writing partner. “Ever.”
The Golden Globes, Hollywood’s most freewheeling televised award show, could be unusually influential this year. The roughly 90 voting members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association have traditionally had little in common with the nearly 9,000 industry professionals that make up the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The HFPA is known for calculatingly packing its show with as much star power as possible, occasionally rewarding even the likes of “The Tourist” and “Burlesque.”
Sunday’s show may have added to that history with an unexpected award for “Missing Link” for best animated feature film over films like “Toy Story 4” and “Lion King.” No one was more surprised than its director, Chris Butler. “I’m flabbergasted,” he said.
But the condensed time frame of this year’s award season (the Oscars are Feb. 9) brings the Globes and the Academy Awards closer. Balloting for Oscar nominations began Thursday. Voters were sure to be watching.
The dearth of nominations for female filmmakers stoked more backlash than anything else at this year’s Globes. Only men were nominated for best director (just five women have ever been nominated in the category), and none of the 10 films up for best picture was directed by a woman, either.

BEVERLY HILLS: Classic Hollywood takes center stage at the Golden Globes on Sunday, kicking off an unusually crowded awards season where the top movie honors are wide open.
The awards, handed out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), have shown a knack for rewarding movies that go on to do well at the Oscars in February.

Netflix’s wrenching “Marriage Story” and costly gangster epic “The Irishman” lead a field of dramatic movie contenders for Golden Globes that feature some of the biggest names in Hollywood but few safe bets on the likely winners.
“The winners are not that predictable. There are four legitimate contenders for top movie drama,” said Matthew Belloni, editorial director of the Hollywood Reporter.
Immersive World War One movie “1917” and religious biography “The Two Popes” round out the movie drama contenders.
Also competing for awards are “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” stars Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and director Quentin Tarantino, along with “Hustlers” actress Jennifer Lopez, actors Tom Hanks for “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” and Eddie Murphy in comeback mode with comedy “Dolemite is My Name,” and “The Irishman” director Martin Scorsese and veterans Al Pacino and Joe Pesci.
With acerbic British comedian Ricky Gervais hosting for the first time in four years, anything could happen at the informal, often boozy dinner in Beverly Hills.
One of the closest contests is for best movie drama actor between publicity-averse stars Joaquin Phoenix and Adam Driver.
Phoenix’s terrifying “Joker” performance has made him a force to be reckoned with this year, while Driver’s heart-wrenching role as a father resisting divorce and its consequences follows acclaimed turns as villain Kylo Ren in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” and political tale “The Report.”
A win in the best movie drama or comedy/musical fields by Netflix would mark the biggest Hollywood breakthrough so far by streaming services that have revolutionized the entertainment industry. Netflix leads the pack with a total of 34 nominations across film and television.
One of the few actor shoo-ins on Sunday appears to be Renee Zellweger for her role as the legendary entertainer Judy Garland in “Judy.”
“She gave a universally admired performance, and the HFPA has a history of honoring her,” said Belloni
Lopez, who wowed audiences as a feisty pole dancer in “Hustlers,” which she also produced, appears to be the favorite for the supporting actress statuette, while Pitt is the presumed front-runner for his supporting role as a 1960s stunt man in the nostalgic “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” awards watchers say.
On the television side, Jennifer Aniston crowned her return to the small screen with an acting nomination for “The Morning Show,” one of the first offerings from Apple TV+. The show also is in the running for best TV drama series.
The Oscars take place this year on Feb. 9, three weeks earlier than usual, causing a traffic jam of award shows.
“Everything is crunched together. We are going to have award show after award show after award show, and it is exhausting for a lot of the people that are nominated,” said Belloni.

The actress and her musician husband, Benji Madden, on Friday announced the birth of a daughter they’ve named Raddix.
“We are so happy, blessed and grateful to begin this new decade by announcing the birth of our daughter,” Diaz wrote on Instagram. “She has instantly captured our hearts and completed our family.”
But don’t expect a photo of the baby. Diaz wrote that while she and Madden “are overjoyed to share this news” they “also feel a strong instinct to protect our little one’s privacy.” The Instagram post had no image attached.
“We won’t be posting pictures or sharing any more details, other than the fact that she is really really cute! Some would even say RAD,” Diaz wrote.
Diaz, whose films include “There’s Something About Mary” and “Bad Teacher,” married Madden, a member of the band Good Charlotte, in early 2015.
Both parents posted the identical message on Instagram. Representatives for both stars did not immediately respond to calls for comment.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/study-finds-2019-was-a-banner-year-for-female-filmmakers/,"NEW YORK: Lulu Wang, Lorene Scafaria, Melina Matsoukas and Greta Gerwig led Hollywood to a record year for women in the director’s chair. In 2019, women directed more of the most popular movies than any year before.
Women directed 12 of 2019’s top 100-grossing films in 2019, according to a study released Thursday by USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. That percentage of female filmmakers, 10.6%, is greater than researchers have recorded before, suggesting that some measure of change is finally coming to a film industry where inequality behind the camera has remained stubbornly persistent.

It’s the most meaningful increase in several decades for female directors. Despite mounting outcry, the rate of female directors helming Hollywood’s top productions has long been largely stagnant. The previous high in USC’s annual study was 8%, in 2008. In 2018, only 4.5% of the year’s top films were directed by women.
“This is the first time we have seen a shift in hiring practices for female film directors in 13 years,” said Stacy L. Smith, one of the study’s authors. “One notable reason for this jump in 2019 was that Universal Pictures had five films with women directors at the helm in the top 100 movies. Yet there is still much more progress needed to reach parity for women behind the camera.”
The high-profile success of several films had already made 2019 a historic one for women. Those include Wang’s “The Farewell,” one of the year’s most popular indie releases, Scafaria’s acclaimed “Hustlers” ($105 million domestically), Matsoukas’ “Queen & Slim” ($40.7 million) and Gerwig’s “Little Women,” which last week opened strongly with $29 million in its first five days of release.
“Frozen II,” with $1.2 billion in worldwide ticket sales, is close to setting a new box-office record for a movie directed by a woman. Jennifer Lee, who co-directed the film, set the record with the first “Frozen” film. In 2018, Lee became the chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios.
Other notable films included Kasi Lemmons’ “Harriet,” Tina Gordon’s “Little” and Jill Culton’s “Abominable.”
USC researchers singled out Universal Pictures, which put forward a slate of films with 26% directed by women. Universal is the only major studio with a female studio chief, Donna Langley.
Netflix also fared well. While the streaming company’s films largely bypass theaters — leaving them outside the study’s parameters — 20% of Netflix’s 2019 movies were directed by women.
Paramount Pictures, however, hasn’t released a movie directed by a woman in the last five years.
Four women of color directed one of the top 100 movies in 2019, though the overall statistics for underrepresented directors dipped. Underrepresented filmmakers were behind 16.8% of films in 2019, a decline from last year’s 21.4%, a record.
“While 2019 is a banner year for women, we will not be able to say there is true change until all women have access and opportunity to work at this level,” said Smith.
Another study released Thursday by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University examined women in the top films as not just directors but writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers. Women accounted for 20% of all such roles in the year’s top films, up from 16% the year before.
But the San Diego State University study, the 22nd annual Celluloid Ceiling authored by Martha Lauzen, found less progress when the movies researched were expanded to the top 500 films. In that metric, Lauzen found women held steady at 23%.
“While the numbers moved in a positive direction this year, men continue to outnumber women 4 to 1 in key behind-the-scenes roles,” Lauzen said in a statement. “It’s odd to talk about reaching historic highs when women remain so far from parity.”
Despite gains, female filmmakers have been largely overlooked in this awards season. Sunday’s Golden Globes, presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, includes no women nominated for best director. None of the 10 films nominated for best picture were directed by women, either.
Rebecca Goldman, Time’s Up chief operating officer, earlier said those results were unacceptable.
“This year, there have been twice as many women-led features than ever, with more films by female directors on the way,” Goldman said. “Women — and especially women of color — continue to be pushed to the sidelines by a system that holds women back, onscreen and off.”

NEW YORK: Stocks ended slightly higher on Friday, helped by better-than-expected quarterly results from Google’s parent Alphabet and retailer Amazon and a modest recovery in oil prices.
However, the gains were held back by disappointing results from Exxon Mobil as well as news out of the Bank of Japan, which did not announce as much stimulus as many had hoped.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 24.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,432.24.
The Dow was held back partly by a drop in the oil giant Exxon Mobil. The company reported its smallest quarterly profit in 17 years, well below what analysts were looking for, due to the continuing weakness in oil prices. Its major competitor, Chevron, fared slightly better. While earnings dropped sharply from a year ago, Chevron’s results still beat analysts’ expectations.
Exxon fell $1.25, or 1.4 percent, to $88.95. Chevron climbed 69 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $102.48 after being down earlier in the day.
Broader market indicators ended higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,173.60 and the Nasdaq composite increased 7.15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,162.13.
Wall Street is finishing out its busiest week of corporate earnings, which was dominated by mostly strong results from technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and others.
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped $25.50, or 3.3 percent, to $791.34. The company reported earnings of $8.42 a share, well above the $8.04 that analysts were looking for.
Amazon rose $6.20, or 1 percent, to $758.81. The online retail giant reported a profit of $1.78 per share, well above the $1.11 a share that analysts expected. Amazon reported it sold $30.4 billion in goods in the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier.
The strong results from Amazon and Google, as well as the results from other tech companies, helped lift the technology-heavy Nasdaq 1.2 percent this week, while the Dow lost 0.8 percent. The S&P 500 closed the week down slightly. It was the first weekly loss for the S&P 500 after four weeks of gains.
So far, corporate profits appear to be coming well ahead of what were very low expectations. Earnings in the S&P 500 so far are down 2.4 percent from a year ago, which is better than the 5.2 percent decline expected when earnings season started, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“Expectations were exceptionally low for the second quarter. While consumers goods and technology has been better than expected, the energy sector continues to show challenges,” said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock.
Investors remain cautious, however. The run-up earlier this month made stocks more expensive than investors are historically comfortable with. The S&P 500 is trading at 18.5 times its expected earnings for the next year, noticeable above the 12-14 times investors typically look for.
The presidential election will continue to grow as an issue for markets in the next several months. Investors dislike uncertainty, and the unexpectedly close presidential election and mostly unknown policies of Donald Trump puts them on edge.
Next week another fifth of the S&P 500 will report their results, including Proctor & Gamble, General Motors, Kraft Heinz, 21st Century Fox and Allstate, among many others.
Moore also pointed out the July jobs report, released August 5, will give investors direction since the June and May jobs reports showed two clashing directions for the US economy.
Japan’s central bank ended a policy meeting Friday by announcing it will expand purchases of exchange traded funds from financial institutions to help inject more cash into the world’s third-largest economy and pursue its 2 percent inflation target. But the measures fell short of hopes for more aggressive action. That helped the yen surge as investors priced in fewer yen in circulation. The dollar dropped to 102.03 yen from 105.45 yen.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury note falling to 1.46 percent from 1.51 percent the day before.
In energy trading, benchmark US crude reversed earlier losses and was up 46 cents to close at $41.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 24 cents to $42.46 a barrel in London.
Heating oil rose less than 1 cent to $1.28 a gallon, wholesale gasoline futures rose 1 cent to $1.32 a gallon and natural gas fell was little changed at $2.88 per thousand cubic feet.
In other currencies, the euro rose to $1.1179 from $1.1073 the day before and the British pound rose to $1.3239 from $1.3148.
The price of gold closed up $16.70 to $1,349 an ounce, silver rose 16 cents to $20.31 an ounce and copper rose a penny to $2.222 a pound.

Five years after United Airlines and Continental merged, Munoz declared in a public letter published in national newspapers on Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015, that the combined company has failed to live up to the expectations of both fliers and United’s employees.

NEW YORK: Five years after United Airlines and Continental merged, the company’s new CEO declared in a public letter that the combined company has failed to live up to the expectations of both fliers and United’s employees.
Just three weeks into the job, CEO Oscar Munoz acknowledged in full-page newspaper ads that “the journey hasn’t always been smooth.”
Since the merger, United has been plagued with chronic delays, computer outages and dissatisfied workers, who have a reputation for taking out their frustrations on fliers. The problems overshadowed the tenure of former CEO Jeff Smisek, who took over the combined airline when the merger closed on Oct. 1, 2009.
On Sept. 8, Chicago-based United Continental Holdings said Smisek was ousted following an internal investigation into the airline’s dealing with the public agency that operates its hub airport in Newark, New Jersey. That agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is part of a federal investigation into abuse of power. Munoz, a railroad executive and head of United’s audit committee, was named president and CEO.
In his letter, which ran in national newspapers, Munoz didn’t offer any hints as to how he will actually fix United’s many problems except that he will listen to fliers and employees.
“We are committed to re-earning your trust,” he wrote.
The company set up a website, UnitedAirtime.com, for people to ask questions and provide feedback to the airline. The airline posted a few questions and answers in advance of the site’s launch that focus on delayed luggage delivery, aging airplanes that lack Wi-Fi or working TVs and the poor quality of first-class meals.
“Let’s be honest, the implementation of the United and Continental merger has been rocky for customers and employees,” Munoz says on a video greeting on the site. “While it’s been improving recently, we still haven’t lived up to our promise or our potential.”

WASHINGTON: US manufacturers expanded at their slowest pace in two years last month, held back by faltering global growth and cutbacks in oil and gas drilling.
The Institute for Supply Management says its index of factory activity fell sharply to 50.2 in September from 51.1 in August. That is the lowest level since May 2013. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders and production both fell sharply and a measure of hiring also declined, according to the ISM, a trade group of purchasing managers. All three still barely remained in expansion territory.
US manufacturers are getting hit by slower growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy, and a stronger dollar, which makes US goods more expensive overseas. Oil and gas drillers are also cutting back on their orders for steel pipe and other goods in the wake of sharply lower oil prices.
China’s factory activity contracted last month, according to a survey of its purchasing managers, though its manufacturing index inched up to 49.8 from 49.7 in August.
Manufacturers cut 15,000 jobs last month, the most in five years, payroll services provider ADP said Wednesday. The government will release its jobs report Friday, and economists forecast it will show that the economy added 206,000 jobs overall.
The unemployment rate is expected to remain at a seven-year low of 5.1 percent.
Most economists expect US manufacturing will do little for the economy for the rest of the year, with the possible exception of automakers. But so far, healthy consumer spending on cars, homes and restaurant meals is offsetting overseas weakness and driving modest growth.

Are we utilising resources to the best of our ability?
As Shahrukh Khan stated in the blockbuster film, ‘Chennai Express’ — “Don’t underestimate the power of a common man”, the financial markets can deliver the same phrase with a twist. Don’t underestimate the power of information! In the age of technology and information, the world of traders has been enveloped by numerous data and reports. Life, as the traders know it, has been surrounded by scores of data emancipating from various economies and every second matters in the race towards accomplishing profits. With the passage of time, global markets have provided innovative ways to look at the markets and the fundamentals within it. Given that global markets are operating 24 hours a day and five days a week, inevitably investors will enhance their knowledge levels.
In recent times, during market operation, information does stem out from every corner of the globe with astounding pace that traders need to keep an eye on every major economy around the globe. Given the markets is a convergent point for the constant flow of information, investors should weigh the data and incorporate the ones which one feels will be imperative to his trading strategies. Easier said than done, the preceding sentence might leave some readers with a raised eyebrow and an immediate question — how do I weigh the information or how can I know the importance of such information?
In the first few trades, it is important to follow the impact of such information and wait to enact on the appropriate trade. With experience, the trader will learn the importance of such information and incorporate similar strategies in the ensuing days too.
But given the importance of the word ‘information’, are we utilising resources to the best of our abilities? Having undertaken numerous training classes related to the markets, I have noticed that participants have not been keeping themselves updated with the latest developments from around the globe. It is next to impossible to throw the dart expecting to find the bull’s eye when darkness has clouded the room. However, with light, the task of finding the bull’s eye becomes a tad easier. Information is the light, guiding traders and making the process of trading more effective.
A mentor once said — “information from the markets, if interpreted and processed in the right manner, will always reap greater results in the forthcoming days.” In contemporary times, processing the given information is a major challenge for the prevailing investors. In theory, trading seems easier but when theory has to be converted into practice, life does not seem to be easy. However, with experience and practice, one will surely master the art of trading from the given processed information. Hence, information is the most important commodity in today’s global financial world.

FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

Morning shows the day. Youngest amongst the 13 girls, Martina Gautam believes in giving her best in whatever she does. A recent high school graduate, she wants to pursue Biomedical engineering in her undergraduate studies. Head strong about her goals, she leaves no opportunities behind to achieve them.
When EmpowHER came around, she knew what she needed to do. The idea of sharing the same platform with other like-minded women and learning new things excited her. She joined EmpowHER with a hope to improve her leadership skills, and bring back her experience and understandings to her students.
She has been working as a teacher since the last three years at a women’s school in her neighbourhood. Many of her students work as domestic helpers in dif ferent houses in the community. In exchange for school fees, many young women from rural Nepal travel to the capital to work as domestic helpers. Despite mistreatment and abuse, these girls stay with their host families so that they can receive free schooling. But most of them do not even get to go to school, and even if they do they cannot concentrate and lag behind in their classes due to over workload. Therefore, through her EmpowHER ‘Impact Service Project’ Martina will provide free coaching classes to help these girls with their assignments and class works including sessions on ESL, mathematics, and computer courses. Based on their performance in the coaching classes, she will provide
scholarships to few students to support their tuition fees. She hopes her effort will
help at least few young women to pursue education without being forced into domestic labour.
For her, EmpowHER has exceeded her expectation. It has offered more than she had anticipated, helping her gain more clarity about her goals and herself.

Reap what you sow. Nisha Bhatt who is a second year Bachelor’s student of Social Science knows that to get good results you need to put in good effort. Passionate about
social change, she believes that a society can only be progressive when women are
given their basic rights without hesitance.
Through her ‘Impact Service Project’, she wants to create awareness about “Chaupadi”, an old tradition that banishes women during their menstruation forcing them to live in a sheds or outbuildings. They have limited food, poor sanitation, and are vulnerable to wild animal attacks and sexual harassments. Despite being
outlawed in 2005, many families in Western Nepal still practice this detrimental and life threatening tradition. She wants to pilot her project in Mashfal VDC in Dolpa, where many women have lost their lives to Chaupadi. With the help of her project, she will be providing awareness trainings in the community to help women overcome the social pressure to practice such traditions, and establish an understanding of menstruation as a biological process rather than a regressive social practice. She will also provide trainings on women health and how women can take care of themselves while they are menstruating. She hopes that her efforts will help the community gain a different perspective on women menstruation, leading to both behavioral and social change towards such practices.
She joined EmpowHER to empower herself so that she can enable other women in the community. Through EmpowHER she has been able to strengthen her interpersonal skills, better herself as a leader, and develop ever lasting sisterhood.
As the journey of EmpowHER progresses, we see the passion, focus, and the sense of responsibility towards the community brewing strongly in our participants. We are confident that these change makers will leave no stones unturned to make a powerful impact anywhere they go.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”

” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/trade-with-confidence/,"IT IS SEEN THAT TRADERS FOCUS ON RESULTS RATHER THAN PROCESS

KATHMANDU: Trade outcomes cannot be assured. The market might be predicted up to some level but its result is uncertain. You entered a market with full preparation to come out successful and it happened to be same as predicted but it can be the other way too; you entered a market with full study and analysis and relied on probabilities to come out successful but it had an unexpected outcome. The nature of trading is like that. Due to its nature and effect on the psyche of human being, it is essential to have a lot of self-confidence.
Self-confidence is an element which is required in every field to excel. Without this underlying competence, a person cannot grow and be ahead. It is rightly said that ‘Without confidence, we can do little in life. With it, we can change the world’. Confidence is a tool which when used in trading can have a positive impact and help to improve the performance thereon. Self-confidence in trading is the ability to focus on improvement and better performance thereby keeping self away from negative thought patterns like fear, greed, anxiety, et cetera.

Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade

Many traders have the misconception that winning trades develop confidence but the fact is just the opposite. More winning trades come from a dedicated focus on the process of trading where traders develop their skills and in doing so, develop their confidence. Focus on the process of trading is very important but very often, it is seen that traders focus on results rather than process. Soon if a trader sees a loss or two in a strategy they attempted, they will discard the strategy. This attitude leads only to frustration. So, in the phase of trading it is quite important to understand how we learn. Learning does not start at point A and steadily progress to point B; it is not a linear. Learning occurs in a series of ups and downs. We grow a little, fall back a bit, advance some more, take breaks and this is how it goes.
Other thing which leads to confidence development is positive thoughts. Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade. They don’t have a negative outlook. Rather they are quite optimistic and try to learn from their mistakes. It is said that positive outlook brings out positive result and the same applies to trading too. So instead of burdenning your mind with negative thoughts and wasting your time, be positive and think of how you can plan your trade better and follow it properly.
Develop self-confidence and you will see a better performance in your trade!

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/entrepreneur-juggler/,"“START SMALL, REALLY SMALL. TEST YOUR BUSINESS MODEL BEFORE YOU REACH OUT TO THE MASS.”

KATHMANDU: Amun Thapa, 27, owner/co-owner of five companies combined suggests that he is an ‘entrepreneur juggler’. When asked what it means, he states, “Someone who is constantly juggling between several ventures. At present, I manage Sasto Deal, Sasto Book, Irish Pub, Chhahari Production and Anthropose. A few other interesting projects are in the pipeline.”
Before asking him how he manages to look after all of these, I was curious to know where he started. Amun, I discovered, sees things in black and white without much grey areas. “For any problem, there are two approaches — to complain or to seek for solutions. I have always taken the latter approach. I never intended to become an entrepreneur. But the problems I personally faced in Nepal and elsewhere got me to come up with solutions, and hence the businesses I am involved with,” he shares. He says that getting where he is today was not an easy task. In his own words, “The first and foremost hurdle, when starting a business, is to understand the local legal and tax systems. Nepali entrepreneurs still do not have a clear understanding of how they should go about when it comes to taxation. It is a shame but also a reality that most businesses operate without proper registration and billings. This makes it difficult for other businesses to work. Also, finding the right employees is another major challenge here, apart from building culture.”
Amun shares that getting investment for a start-up in Nepal was a daunting task. He blames the regulations set by the Central Bank for Foreign Direct Investment and suggests that the easiest route is to seek for investment among friends and family. With profit margins depending on the venture/start-up, Amun says that the first year of the start-up, he did not care much about the profit margin but diverted their efforts in generating brand awareness. He shares, “This is when the advertisement costs are at their maximum. But to put it in numbers, a venture must seek at least 10 per cent to 40 per cent profit margin for it to be sustainable and scalable.”
On employees he says, “The smartest thing to do is ignore the resume because it tells nothing about an employee. We hire them on the basis of their performance during their internship period (which usually lasts for two months). Most of them come through referrals. We also have performance incentives to encourage employees to work at their level best. As for salaries, I believe everyone deserves to be paid well, like the saying goes — if you look after your employees, they will look after your clients.” He opines that he would definitely focus more on technology if he had the chance to start over again. “Over the past four years I have witnessed consumers adapting to changes in technology. People have taken to Facebook and Viber for communication, apps are replacing websites, and such. I was talking to a hotel owner in Pokhara yesterday and he told me, one of the first things people ask for after checking-in is the WiFi password.”
When asked about the Nepal’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, Amun says diversification is the key. “Nepal is now not only relying on tourism and hydropower and banking industries as income generating businesses but there are a lot more new industries that were introduced to the market in the past several years. Therefore, we are definitely on the right track.” His words of wisdom for the ones starting out are, “Start small, really small.
Test your business model before you reach out to the mass. Focus on building systems because this comes in handy when you are scaling your businesses. And always give priority to your brand because revenues can go up and down but your brand is what keeps you going.”

Altice expands in US with USD 17.7 billion Cablevision deal
European telecoms group Altice will become a major force in the lucrative US cable market after it agreed to buy fourth-largest operator Cable vision for a mix of cash and shares in a deal worth USD 17.7 billion including debt.
The move is the latest foray by French-Israeli billionaire and Altice founder Patrick Drahi, who built a telecoms and cable empire in recent years via debt-fueled acquisitions in France, Portugal and Israel.Drahi entered the United States in May by buying small regional cable group Suddenlink for USD 9.1 billion and had declared he would do more acquisitions so as eventually to earn half of Altice’s revenue there.
GM to pay USD 900 million settles US criminal case
General Motors Co (GM.N) has agreed to pay USD 900 million and sign a deferred-prosecution agreement to end a US government investigation into its handling of an ignition-switch defect linked to 124 deaths, two sources told Reuters. The deal means GM will be charged criminally with hiding the defect from regulators and in the process defrauding consumers, but the case will be put on hold while GM fulfills terms of the deal, one source said. No individuals would be charged in the criminal case, one of the sources said. The company’s expected USD 900 million payment, confirmed by a second source, is less than the USD 1.2 billion that Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) paid to resolve a similar case.

Global stocks at three-week highs as Fed decision looms
World stocks inched to a three-week high on Thursday while the dollar drifted lower against other currencies, as investors consolidated positions ahead of a nail-biting US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. There was a sense of relief as much as anything that after months of market speculation and advice from almost everyone from the IMF to the heads of the world’s top companies, that the wait for the Fed’s verdict would be over by 1800 GMT. Europe’s main share markets were left at a virtual standstill with Britain’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 all barely budged after two days of gains helped by a flurry of merger activity.Currency and bond market moves were low key too.
Wal-Mart worker group splits in two
A Wal-Mart Stores Inc worker group that has been one of the loudest voices pushing the retailer to boost wages and improve conditions has splintered over a disagreement about funding and strategic direction, according to people on both sides of the split. Both wings are claiming the name OUR Walmart and vow to continue their work, moves that could sow confusion among supporters.The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which for years has provided important funding and resources to the OUR Walmart worker group, will only financially support the wing that it believes represents the broader set of workers. “Recently we had a group split from us,” said Barbara Getz, who said she is head of the health and safety team for the OUR Walmart grouping that is sticking with UFCW.

AUSTRALIA

US Fed may not hike interest rates
The Australian share market has surged ahead of highly anticipated US Federal Reserve rates call, as energy stocks soar on a strong bounce in crude oil prices. Investors remain upbeat approaching the US Federal Reserve’s decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, with financial markets predicting a 30 per cent chance of lift-off. At the 4.15pm (AEST) official market close, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 added 47.9 points, or 0.94 per cent, to 5146.8 points, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 47.6 points, or 0.93 per cent, to 5171.2 points. The growing sense that the US Fed may not hike interest rates has also pushed the Australian dollar above US72c for the first time in three weeks as per The Australian.
Australian shares rose 1.5 per cent on Thursday for a second straight day of gains as all sectors rallied ahead of the US Fed’s interest rate decision later in the day. Banks and miners were among the clear winners with the “Big Four” lenders rising more than two percent in early trade. A jump in oil prices pushed energy stocks higher. The S&P/ASX 200 index added 73.83 points to 5,172.7 by 0215 GMT. The index closed 1.6 per cent higher on Wednesday, and is on track to post a second straight weekly gain. Analysts said the market could claw back some of the day’s gain as the near-month futures contract expires on Thursday and could add some volatility. Asian stocks hit a three-week high on Thursday after a jump in oil prices lifted Wall Street, with many investors taking last-minute positions ahead of the Fed’s policy decision.

BANGLADESH

Secretary of state for treasury ministry
According to The Daily Star, Poland is interested in investing in mining, coal extraction and installation of liquefied natural gas terminal in Bangladesh as the European country has experience in the sectors, a deputy minister said yesterday. Zdzislaw Gawlik, secretary of state for the treasury ministry, also said his country is keen to explore shell gas in Bangladesh. “We are bringing in very solid proposals of investment in Bangladesh,” he said. “I know Bangladesh is developing at a faster rate. So we are working at the government-to-government and business-to-business levels to intensify bilateral relationship.”
Tea prices in Bangladesh edged higher for a second straight week at the weekly auction on Tuesday amid tight supplies and strong demand for quality leaf. Bangladeshi tea fetched an average 187.93 taka (USD 2.4) per kg at the 19th auction of the current marketing season, slightly up from 185.81 taka at the previous week’s sale when the prices snapped seven-week losing streak, an executive with National Brokers said. There was huge demand for quality tea, while volume dropped again this week compared with last week, helping prices to perk up, the executive said. About 1.93 million kg was offered at the sole auction centre in Chittagong, of which 6.5 per cent was unsold. In the previous auction, about 10 per cent of the 2.17 million kg offered went unsold. The national budget for the 2015/16 fiscal year that started in July raised the regulatory duty on tea imports by five per cent to discourage overseas buying. Tea prices fell sharply in the last marketing season on poor demand from local buyers as business sentiment was hit by renewed political unrest early this year that left more than 120 people dead and disrupted supplies. The country, however, has moved from being a net exporter to a net importer of tea due to rising consumption.

CHINA

Activists rally ouside the White House
China’s economic powerhouse is slowing, destabilising global markets. Beijing’s neighbors, unnerved over its pursuit of territorial claims, are increasingly cosying up to Washington. A threat of US cyber sanctions looms over Chinese companies. It might seem an ideal time for US President Barack Obama to take advantage of Beijing’s troubles and get tough when he hosts Chinese leader Xi Jinping for a state visit on September 25. Obama is expected to press Xi on issues that have strained relations between the two countries, but his approach will be tempered because for better or worse the world’s two biggest economies are inextricably bound together. That will mean a difficult balancing act for Obama. He is under pressure to send a strong message to Xi over cyber spying, Chinese economic policies and South China Sea disputes, but he does not want to upend a summit that could set the tone for relations for his last 16 months in office.
Just as China shows that its domestic stock market can be something of a one-way street — investors can put money in, but not take money out — the biggest mutual fund company, Vanguard Group, is moving ahead with plans to expose more mom-and-pop investors to the country’s heavily restricted exchanges. With the Shanghai stock exchange down by 37 per cent and the Shenzhen exchange off by 43 per cent during the past three months, compared with just an 18 per cent drop on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, Vanguard is adding China mainland stocks to its USD 60 billion emerging markets fund in the coming year.Vanguard says adding A-shares — stocks that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, as opposed to those that trade on the Hong Kong exchange — will diversify the fund, but acknowledges they pose unique risks related to tracking a benchmark. Steps taken by the Chinese government to restrict trading on domestic exchanges make it difficult for index funds to buy the stocks they need to replicate the performance of Chinese benchmarks, fund executives said.

EUROPE

Nestle fails to convince European judges
According to The Guardian, Nestlé has failed in an attempt to convince European judges to let it trademark the shape of the four-finger version of a KitKat in the UK. The European court of justice ruled that the KitKat’s shape was not distinctive enough for consumers to associate it with the chocolate covered wafer. Nestlé is not seeking to trademark its two-fingered version of KitKat. Nestlé had argued that even without its red and white packaging or the word KitKat embossed on the chocolate, the shape of the bar should be regarded as distinct. The dispute between Nestlé and Cadbury, which has fought to prevent Nestlé securing a trademark, will go back to the UK high court for a final ruling that will determine whether rivals will be able to launch copycat KitKats in Britain.Despite the court’s failure to allow the trademark, Nestlé said it was pleased with the ruling.
International creditors expect the first review of Greek reforms under the latest bailout to start in October, bringing changes to a memorandum of understanding signed with Athens and paving the way for debt rescheduling talks, Euro Zone officials said. Euro Zone finance ministers will discuss preparations for Greek reforms envisaged by the third bailout, worth 86 billion euros (USD 96.8 billion), at an informal meeting in Luxembourg on Saturday. No implementation review is possible before Greece’s September 20 parliamentary elections. “There are elections in Greece. We have to wait for the results,” Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna, whose country holds the EU’s rotating presidency, told Reuters in an interview.

INDIA

Reserve Bank of India headquaters, Mumbai
India requires sustained low inflation and a credible programme for fiscal rectitude to lower the cost of capital, Urjit Patel, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said on Thursday, striking a hawkish note after government calls for interest rate cuts to boost the economy. The central banker also said in a speech to a business conference that he expected India’s current account deficit to be 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product in the 2015/16 fiscal year. New banking licences issued by the RBI were also aimed at lowering the cost of capital, Patel said. His remarks addressed concerns that commercial banks have failed to pass on recent cuts in the RBI’s main policy rate to their borrowers.
India plans to address some pending tax disputes in the next few days, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday, but did not give details or say whether the cases in question included disputes with foreign companies that have spooked investors. Earlier this month, the finance ministry decided not to press claims for a Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) against foreign portfolio investors. India remains locked in major back-tax battles with telecoms group Vodafone (VOD.L) and Cairn Energy (CNE.L). Arun Jaitley said last week that the government was trying to resolve pending tax cases, many of them outside the courts.

JAPAN

Workers are seen in a container area at a port
Japan’s exports slowed for a second straight month in August in a worrying sign that China’s economic slowdown could deal a damaging blow to the world’s third-biggest economy and force policymakers to inject fresh stimulus before too long. The data joins a string of depressing shipment numbers in key regional economies — including South Korea and Taiwan — which has heightened anxiety over a China-led slowdown in global growth and tempered bets of the US Federal Reserve lifting rates for the first time in almost a decade later on Thursday.Slowing exports could increase the chance of additional monetary easing from the Bank of Japan, because this could lead to lower factory output, slack economic activity and less momentum needed to offset deflationary pressure caused by a collapse in oil prices.
Vietnam agreed with Japan on Tuesday to step up security cooperation, becoming the latest Southeast Asian country to seek closer ties with Tokyo as China maintains an assertive posture in disputed waters in the South China Sea. The agreement between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Vietnam’s Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong comes after a US expert said on Monday China appeared to be carrying out preparatory work for a third airstrip in contested territory in the South China Sea. China has overlapping claims with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei in the South China Sea. It is also embroiled in a row with Japan over a group of East China Sea islets. Earlier this year, Japan reached an agreement with Malaysia and the Philippines to strengthen security ties.

Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Thursday ahead of a likely policy move by the US Federal Reserve, with stocks in Malaysia outperforming and Singapore hitting a more than one-week high as a big jump in global oil prices boosted energy stocks. Oil prices jumped as much as six per cent on Wednesday after a US stock draw. Oil bulls were also encouraged by doubts on whether the Fed will decide to hike US interest rates on Thursday after tame August inflation data. Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur composite index was up 2.1 per cent on a rally in oil-related stocks. The index touched 1,691.93, a near six-week high, on resuming trade after a market holiday.

While Malaysia’s premier faces tough questions over the origin of hundreds of millions of dollars transferred to his bank accounts, the country has tentatively received good grades for its anti-money laundering efforts from a team of international experts, documents reviewed by Reuters show. A draft report by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body which monitors how countries fight illicit financial flows, said Malaysia had put in place a “robust policy framework” to combat money laundering.But it said the Asian country needed to be more effective in targeting high-risk offences and needs to pay more attention to transnational crime. The draft, dated Aug 4 and marked for official use, said the FATF inspection team found the Malaysian government had a “strong political commitment and well functioning coordination structures” to fight money laundering and that “significant resources have been allocated” to investigations in this field.

RUSSIA

Launch of new Opel Astra to boost sales
General Motors (GM.N) executives said they remained committed to meeting their goal of reaching profitability in Europe by 2016, brushing aside concerns that a downturn in Russia could put their goal at risk. “We are confident about reaching our goal,” Opel Chief Executive Karl-Thomas Neumann told journalists at the Frankfurt auto show on Tuesday. In July, GM warned its European employees the Opel and Vauxhall brands were still posting significant losses, and meeting its goal of returning to profit by next year would be difficult given the crisis in Russia and the Euro Zone. But General Motors President Dan Ammann said on Tuesday the launch of a new Opel Astra would help boost sales.
Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc on Tuesday said it expected to complete its new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a soon-to-be banned Russian engine, but the date could slip if it does not receive enough US government funding. Aerojet Vice President Julie Van Kleeck declined comment on reports that Aerojet has offered USD two billion to acquire United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 rocket launch venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Analysts say the bid is a strategic move by Aerojet to shut out rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, that is developing a new engine favored by ULA for use in its new Vulcan rocket. ULA has said Blue Origin’s engine programme is about two years ahead of Aerojet’s work on the AR-1 engine, a claim Aerojet disputes.Work on the new engines gained urgency after US lawmakers passed a ban on use of Russian RD-180 engines for launches of US military or spy satellites following Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine last year.

PAKISTAN

Pakistan and Afghanistan have shelved a raft of agreements that promised to more than triple cross-border trade, officials said, as economic ties seen as key to regional stability fall victim to rivalry and suspicion. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani struck the trade deals with Pakistan soon after taking office last year as part of a broader rapprochement that included plans to share intelligence on Taliban insurgents active in both countries. That cooperation was aimed at tackling the Islamist militant movement, which has separate Afghan and Pakistani branches whose violent campaigns kill thousands of people each year and hamper much-needed development. The trade deals were supposed to be a step towards warmer relations and boosting Afghanistan-Pakistan trade from USD 1.6 billion now to USD five billion by 2017. But officials told Reuters that the agreements, which include reducing tariffs and granting each other preferential trade status, have stalled.
Pakistani farmers will receive USD 3.2 billion in grants, subsidies and loan advances from the government, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced on Tuesday, in a bid to spur sluggish growth in one of the country’s main economic sectors. The new schemes represent the government’s largest economic development programme for the agricultural sector since it was voted into office in 2013.The funds will be provided through immediate cash grants and subsidies on agricultural inputs worth USD 1.4 billion, while loan advances worth USD 1.85 billion will also be made and disbursements begin this year, he said. “The conditions of the agricultural sector do not inspire confidence,” Sharif said as he announced the new package at a farmers’ convention in Islamabad. The package includes immediate cash grants for rice and cotton farmers, cuts in fertiliser prices, and a government scheme to pay insurance premiums for farmers who cannot afford them.

THAILAND

TAC plan expansion of it 4G mobile network
Thailand’s Total Access Communication Pcl (TAC) said on Thursday it is planning a major expansion of its fourth generation (4G) mobile network, as it seeks to displace rivals Advanced Info Service Pcl and True Corp. The country’s second largest mobile operator, controlled by Norway’s Telenor, has received regulatory approval to provide 4G services on the 1800MHz frequency band, which is currently used for 2G, Chief Executive Officer Lars Norling told a news conference. TAC also plans to increase its number of base stations to 32,000 in early 2016 from 17,000 now, aiming to provide 4G network coverage nationwide.
The Asian Development Bank will lower its 2015 GDP growth forecast for Thailand from the current 2.9 to 3.0 per cent following weaker-than-expected performance in the first half, the Bangkok Post reported, citing Luxamon Attapich, the bank’s senior economist for Thailand.The new growth forecast, due to be announced on Sept 22, will be higher than 2.5 per cent, the paper reported.

USA

A women walks past the FR headquaters
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has made clear she would rather delay an interest rate hike for too long than move sooner and risk jeopardising a tepid economic recovery, a conviction that will face its sharpest test yet on Thursday. Having weighed the economy’s steady march toward full employment against the backdrop of weak inflation and wage growth and turbulence overseas, the US central bank will issue its latest rate decision at the end of a two-day policy meeting. A rate hike would be the first in the United States in nearly a decade. Fed watchers, however, see the outcome as a toss-up, with Yellen’s consistently stated desire to see workers reap more benefits from the recovery, coupled with weak price rises and a variety of global risks, looming large. “It is a game-time decision. The key is what Yellen thinks and my guess is that she will want to wait,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. “If you put yourself in her shoes, you don’t want to make a mistake by going too soon.”
Oil prices were stable on Thursday as a US stock draw tightened the market while Asia’s economies showed new signs of weakness.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading at USD 47.13 per barrel at 0430 GMT, virtually unchanged from their previous close, while Brent was up 6 cents at USD 49.81 per barrel. That followed a price jump of as much as six per cent in the previous session when data from the US Energy Information Administration showed the largest crude drawdown since February 2014 at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point. Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures said that the stock draw was “a result of higher refining activity and lower US crude production which is helping the US inventory glut to ease off”.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/weak-institutions-hit-economic-growth/,"Poor spending performance by public institutions a challenge for the economy
KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/own-trading-strategies/,"Improve your trading performance
KATHMANDU
Traders are simply investing their time, thinking that if they spend a lot of time around the markets, analysing charts, reading books and studying courses, their skill level will improve. Investing time is necessary when you are starting out, as there is a lot to learn. But putting in hours will not necessarily increase your profit potential. If you always repeat the same mistakes, putting in hours will just be meaningless with those habits in place. To improve, make repeated and deliberate choices. Here are five things to start doing today to improve your trading performance.
GET HELP
Trading is tough and not a cup of tea for everyone especially when we go at it completely alone. So choose a person who could be just a friend or family member who you have told your plans to and who you keep updated on your performance. Share what you are doing, what you are struggling with and what you are having success with. Anyone can get side tracked, so be open to being told when you have gone astray. When your own discipline and self-awareness fails, you will have someone to help you get back on track.
FOLLOW YOUR PLAN
Talking about strategies with other traders or discussing your performance with your trading referee is fine, but avoid the opinions of others when it comes to specific trades. Trade your trading plan, your way. It doesn’t matter if a trader you respect says they are going to buy when your plan says to sell.
PRACTICE
A strategy may seem simple on the surface, but even a simple strategy is hard to implement in live market conditions. Every day, every trend, every pullback is slightly different; nothing looks exactly the same as it did in the textbook examples. So trade it in a demoaccount until you consistently see profit from it.
MENTAL CLARITY
Each day take one minute before you trade to make sure you are feeling clearheaded and focused. Also take a couple of seconds to reiterate that you’re here to trade, not check your social media accounts, email or watch videos online. When you trade, simply focus on trading and leave other matters. Check the economic calendar to be aware of events that may move the market, so you are not taken by surprise during the day. If you are angry, upset or unfocused, avoid trading. It only takes one day, one trade even, to lose an entire account when not in the right mind frame.
RECORD YOUR TRADE
Review every trade you make. Take screenshots of your trades with entries, stop loss levels, targets, and your technical/fundamental notes so you can easily review your trades at a later time.

KATHMANDU
Hear it verbatim from Rajesh KC on how he aspires to build a world-class Nepali brand.
“I have been drawing cartoons since 1990s. Back then they were limited to my friend’s portraits but once I got the platform, I was able to polish my skills and dedicate my time and energy to the same. It has been 25 years now and I recently expanded the skills I have to something new.”
On Phalano Luga: “Phalano Luga came to me as a pleasant surprise. A friend of mine who owned a t-shirt store asked me to design a few prints for t-shirts. While designing, I thought to myself, ‘He might give me royalty and I might make some money out of the designs but why not create a Nepali brand in itself?’ I visited stores for market evaluation and realised that even though Nepal has a lot of talent in terms of designs, the fabric was not up to the mark. Even though the t-shirts had tags that said, ‘100 per cent cotton’, something was amiss. Phalano Luga came into existence with an ambition of creating a Nepali brand for Nepalis to wear. With the fabric imported from Ludhiana, India, and the manufacturing factory located in Patan, I have been able to give the market what I had in mind. The printing machines are imported from California and are top class and that is how I had imagined my brand to be — uncompromising and pocket-friendly.”
On growth: “Initially, I had a target of selling at least one t-shirt per day. I thought that the concept of a Nepali brand might take some time to build but I am surprised with the exponential growth Phalano Luga has seen. In the past two years, my dream of selling one t-shirt per day has topped 30 t-shirts per day.”
On workers: “This is one of the bigger challenges I face. Retaining workers and getting the best ones is a big challenge. A group of Nepali workers are coming back to Nepal from Malaysia to work with me. Apart from retaining them, paying them the same amount they used to earn overseas is a challenge. The people I am working with right now are also working with the production unit of Nike, Adidas, Peter England and other such global brands, based in Nepal. The problem is not the quality of the workers, but the economy and the quality of local materials available.”
On funds: “While starting the business off, my bank was skeptical about giving me a loan. My capital investment was close to one crore and after convincing the bank, I had 30 per cent of the costs covered. Most of the funds were drawn from my own pockets.”
On new ventures: “As of now, with more than satisfactory sales, I have the confidence of expanding my business across the country and abroad. But my first priority would be maintaining the quality for a while before dreaming big. Phalano Coffeeghar which is the latest addition to my business venture is something I am looking up to for now. With Phalano Luga doing well, I partnered with an old friend, Prem Aryal and opened the cafe last week. I had the space and he had the ideas, we got together and came up with the Coffeeghar plan. Like the tees, the eatables available at the cafe will all be Nepali-centric. Long term plans for this cafe are branded water bottles and sugar sachets.”
On the future: “I aspire to make Phalano Luga as big as Nike and Adidas.”

Mad sad ad world. Graphic: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Kathmandu
With the country in dire need of post disaster economic recovery, it is expected that governing bodies address the concerns of major contributors to the GDP. The advertising industry is one such sector with the potential to help with economic recovery; and could provide a significant push towards an economic boom, just as the country needs it the most.
Advertising helps create successful businesses, which then lead to employment opportunities. Even media, the driving force behind growing economies, benefits from stability in the industry, as advertising is the chief source of revenue for mass media like newspapers, television, radio, print magazines and websites. Research has consistently shown that countries with larger investments in the advertising industry are more developed than other countries. For instance, the advertisement industry in the United States creates 18.2 million of the 126.7 million jobs. However, back home in Nepal, the predicament of the advertising industry is such that the government is yet to give due recognition to the industry.
According to the Advertising Association of Nepal (AAN), the total annual revenue of the advertising
industry is Rs 5.5 billion. While it is an industry with vast potential; it appears to lack order with various unresolved issues brimming under the surface.
The present scenario
Although at a very slow pace, the industry was witnessing growth before disaster struck. Post earthquake, the scenario looks far from encouraging. Is there a noticeable difference in the industry before and after the earthquake? Ranjit Acharya, CEO of Prisma Advertising says, “Before the earthquake, the industry was in its growing stage. Growth was rather slow but it was growing
nonetheless. Post earthquake, advertising agencies had to cut down on budgets, as it was the need of the hour. With no help from any quarter it was a necessity to cut down costs.” According to him, most businesses had to cut down on advertising budgets, which led to stagnancy in the industry. He says, “A person must seek medical help when ill and not cut down on medicinal costs. The same is with
advertisements.”
Deependra Tandon, Director of Business Advantage says, “In the first few months after the disaster in April/May we did not have any business. We have gradually recovered now and we hope that the business will revive in the festive season.” He adds that the business is still in its infancy and there is room for improvement.
Ahimsa Yonjan, Managing Partner at TBWA\Benchmark Nepal, says, “The earthquakes led to a rather disturbing slowdown for a month or two, but considering everything that has happened, the industry looks to have weathered the storm rather well”. He adds, “However, as an industry, we do not seem to have learned much from the experience, as there is actually very little difference in communication styles or brand behaviour before or after the earthquakes.”
The mushrooming of advertising agencies
AAN has 298 advertising agencies on its member roster, but there still exist several hundred more agencies that are not registered with the association. With so many advertising agencies operating in the market, it is still generally accepted that most of the advertisements that are produced in Nepal are not satisfactory. On this, Santosh Shrestha, President of AAN says, “Because there is no entry barrier to this industry, anyone can register and have an agency up and running in no time. While this opens a lot of doors for newcomers it leads to compromise on the quality. It becomes a tough job to monitor quality.” He further says, “The world of advertising is creative and fascinating. In Nepal, the industry has an estimated growth of 10 to 15 per cent annually. If we focus on quality control, nothing can stop this industry from growing in the coming years.”
Advertising agencies and advertisement standards
On the compromised quality of advertising and agencies not being up to the mark, Shrestha says, “The quality of advertisement depends of the level of awareness of the society, resources, budget and the economy. Advertisements reflect the attitude of the society. The market is small and the economy is not
progressive. The current focus is on production of effective advertisements rather than creative ones.”
He adds that they are responsible to cater to the mass with limited budget. He says, “Suppose there are three kids who study in grade three, six and eight. Now, all of them must be explained to in a similar manner, in a language they can comprehend. The teacher explains in the easiest way so that every one can understand. The same goes with advertisement.”
Joydeb Chackravarty, Managing Director, JWT – Thompson Nepal has a different view on this subject. He says, “Nepali consumers are exposed to creative advertisements, if not from within the country, but definitely from the world outside. They are intelligent and they know exactly what they want.
Advertisers should not underestimate their level of awareness and should not doubt their intelligence.”
He says that it is high time for the industry to push the envelope in terms of standards and creativity.
Yonjan says, “While I do agree that the overall quality of advertising could be a lot better, I think it is quite unfair to generalise and say that the quality of advertising agencies is not up to the mark. There are a few agencies doing good work locally, so we must give credit where it is due.” He further says, “As with any other industry however, a combination of many factors; such as, lack of industry knowledge and processes, timelines, an unwillingness to provide proper compensation on the side of all parties involved, leads to a large proportion of work being of poor quality. It is the same with art, music and movies. Much of what is produced is quite terrible, but there are those that stand out.”
The clean feed debate
For almost eight years now, AAN has lobbied with the government to introduce a Clean Feed Policy. This policy will ensure content filtering systems that can be used to block foreign commercials aired through foreign channels from reaching the Nepali audience. The main purpose of this policy will be to eliminate the trend of dubbing and encourage multinationals to produce and develop advertisements through local agencies.
Nirmal Raj Poudel, CEO of Welcome Advertising and Marketing, says, “Multinational companies dub foreign advertisements and broadcast them in local channels.  Further, the paid channels also include commercials. This results in quality compromise.”
However, some industrialists claim that clean feed is an uphill task in Nepal. They argue that competition will be killed with the introduction of this policy. A Clean Feed Committee has meanwhile been formed by AAN that has been doing research on the topic and is under dialogue with the government for a quick implementation of this policy.
The right way of doing things
According to some, one of the biggest challenges the industry currently faces is the lack of vision and leadership within the industry. Only self- regulation and quality checks can turn the industry around. Tandon says, “The change must start with the industry itself. Introducing policies is not enough for the development of the industry.” Yonjan has similar views, he says, “We cannot introduce laws to control or fix what are inherently industry problems. What is more necessary is an independent regulatory body that can develop and enforce a code of conduct/best practice model in place for the overall advertising market.”
Although the advertising industry is currently facing an uphill battle, this is still an industry that has enormous potential. With the industry only just beginning to mature, and mediums like digital and new age media opening up, there appears to be much to look forward to for the industry. For the rest of us, it remains the industry to watch.
In parting, it is perhaps Chakravarty who sums it up best — “The next five years are going to be challenging for the advertising industry in Nepal. However, if we follow the right way of doing things and remain honest and integrated there are chances that we can recover soon.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/sangachowk-quake-victims-yet-to-get-relief-amount/,"SINDHUPALCHOWK: The quake victims of Sangachowk VDC, Sindhupalchowk are yet to receive relief amount of Rs 15,000 to procure corrugated zinc sheets to construct temporary shelters to be safe this monsoon.
The monsoon struck the village mid-June, but officials of Sangachowk VDC are still struggling to distribute cash relief to villagers.
Currently, the villagers are living inside temporary shelters made from rusted zinc sheets riddled with holes and timber salvaged from their damaged houses. They kept some zinc sheets and timber to shelter their cattle and poultry after distribution of relief amount was delayed.
Shyam Khadka, 55, of Pokhre said,”The rain water trickles through the zinc sheets. The families of my three sons are housed under one small temporary shelter. Even if the government distributes relief money it will not be sufficient to procure zinc sheets to construct temporary shelters that will accommodate the families of my three sons.”
Basanta Prasad Ghimire, secretary, Sangachowk VDC said cash relief had not been distributed as the registered households claiming cash relief outnumbered the actual damaged households.
“Over 28,000 households have registered for cash relief, whereas, the District Administration Office has allocated cash relief for only 22,000 households on the basis of existing documented records before the earthquake of April 25,” he said.
The government had announced immediate cash relief of Rs 15,000 for one damaged house. The joint families who have not legally divided properties are not eligible for immediate cash relief even if they had been staying in separate houses.
“The joint families who lost more than one house registered fore cash relief under names of different members of the same family,” Ghimire said, stressing that families who had lost more than one house are not satisfied with government policy.
He warned that a monitoring team comprising ward citizens’ forum would be deployed to find such joint families who had registered more than once for the same house before issuing the ID card to claim immediate cash relief and Rs 200,000 to further build a permanent house.
The government released Rs 5.53 billion to the local authorities for immediate relief countrywide in May.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/duplication-in-tax-headings-draws-flak/,"KATHMANDU: The draft of the new constitution has overlooked the concerns related to effective levying of major taxes and duplicated some tax headings in central and state governments, as well as provincial and local governments.
Such duplications might pose a threat to the revenue system once the country adopts a federal structure due to disputes of power allocation between central and provincial government to levy taxes, according to tax experts.
The draft constitution has proposed that excise and individual income tax can be levied by both the central and provincial governments. Similarly, it has also proposed that many other tax headings be levied by the provincial and local governments, like registration tax, vehicle tax and tourist fee.
“Even as related Acts will have to be formulated, the power allocation in the central, provincial and local governments will result in disputes when the laws related to taxes are enforced in the coming days,” opined Rup Khadka, tax expert and the chair of the government-formed High Level Tax System Review Commission. The draft constitution has extended authority to levy taxes, but it is silent on power allocation regarding enforcement, like what portion of the excise duty and IIT can be levied by the province and the portion of the registration and vehicle and land tax that can be levied by the local government.
Giving an example of South Sudan, Khadka said, “The taxes proposed to be levied by the central government were also placed in the domain of provincial government, which led to a dispute. It was later sorted out by forming a task force under the chairmanship of the finance minister of the centre, comprising finance ministers of provinces.”
According to him, it would be better to extend the authority to levy a certain tax to a particular government that can effectively levy that duty. “That power can be shared among other governments.”
The HLTSRC has suggested the finance committee of the Parliament to put customs, VAT, excise, corporate and individual income tax under the domain of the central government for effective enforcement, as these taxes are of stra-tegic importance and strong institutional mechanism is required to levy them effectively. Likewise, registration tax and vehicle tax have been recommended to be levied by provincial government.
Who is to levy what
Central government: Customs, excise, value added tax, corporate income tax, individual income tax, passport fee, visa fee, penalties and royalty of natural resources Provincial government: Wage tax (which covers large portion of individual income tax), land tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, excise, entertainment tax, advertisement tax, tourist fees, agriculture income tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources
Local government: Land and rent tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, service fees, tourist fees, business tax, entertainment tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/development-bond-yields-fall-to-all-time-low/,"KATHMANDU: Yield on development bonds, regardless of their maturity period, has fallen to an all-time low, dampening sentiment of bankers, who have to tap the government securities market to meet some of the regulatory requirements.
Return on 15-year development bonds floated today by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) dropped to 2.65 per cent, the lowest since February 1964, when the government first introduced development bonds with a maturity period of five years to raise debt from the domestic market to finance development activities.
Surprisingly, returns on these securities are falling lately even as their maturity period is increasing.
When NRB auctioned five-year development bonds on May 28, the weighted average cut-off rate stood at four per cent. Then on June 4, when it floated seven-year development bonds, the return fell to 3.44 per cent.
The yield further dropped to 3.08 per cent when NRB offered nine-year development bonds on June 11.
The freefall continued on June 25 as well, when 10-year development bonds were floated. At that time, the weighted average interest rate had dropped to 2.99 per cent.
Considering 7.1 per cent inflation of mid-May, returns on these securities are negative in real term.
“Yields on bonds are falling rapidly because of excess liquidity in the banking sector,” Nara Bahadur Thapa, chief of Public Debt Management Department at NRB told The Himalayan Times.
Banks and financial institutions (BFIs) are currently sitting on excess liquidity of over Rs 70 billion. However, a large chunk of this money cannot be extended as loans because it is being used to meet the minimum regulatory net liquid asset to total deposit ratio, or LD ratio, of 20 per cent.
So, BFIs are rushing to grab these low-yielding securities assuming it is wiser to invest funds in bonds and get some returns rather than let them sit in coffers and generate no return.
Lately, what also appears to have exerted pressure on yields is the government’s decision to repay a part of debt.
So far this fiscal, the government has repaid Rs 42.55 billion of debt, including principal, shows the latest NRB report.
On the other hand, fresh government securities worth only Rs 42.34 billion have been floated in the market. This means net borrowing of the government stood at a negative of around Rs 211 million.
“Because of this, BFIs are rushing to replenish their stock of government securities to maintain LD ratio. This is raising the demand for bonds,” Thapa said, adding, “This is another reason for fall in bond returns.”
The falling bond return is, in fact, good news for the government, as it is now able to raise domestic debt at low interest rates. This means the cost of rebuilding parts of the country ravaged by the earthquake would be a little cheaper.
But bankers say this is creating ‘distortions’ in the market.
“Many BFIs that have purchased low-yielding instruments are now carrying a lot of market risk,” said Sashin Joshi, CEO of Nabil Bank.
This is because purchase of nine-, 10- and 15-year bonds is not a short-term investment, according to Joshi.
“And if returns on bonds rise next year, the instruments bought this year will turn into nothing but loss-making tools. At that time, many BFIs will have no option but to sell those instruments at a discount. This may hit their profitability as well,” Joshi added.

KATHMANDU: There is now little doubt that Pashupati Murarka, officiating president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), will take the helm of the largest private sector umbrella body tomorrow.
Murarka taking the lead of FNCCI has become a certainty after the two other contenders — Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar and Bhawani Rana — withdrew their candidacy for the post of FNCCI president from the election slated for tomorrow.
Organising a press meet on Tuesday, Rajkarnikar had announced his willingness to withdraw his candidacy and support Murarka if Rana also did the same. After Rana formally withdrew her candidacy yesterday, Rajkarnikar also formally pulled out his application today.
So, Murarka is the sole contender for the top post of FNCCI and will be announced as the unanimous president tomorrow. It also means that the post of senior vice president, which Murarka held before he took on the role of officiating chief of FNCCI, will be vacant.
Murarka had been appointed as the officiating president after its past president Pradeep Jung Pandey was arrested in a three-decade old corruption charge on March 18.
As per the FNCCI statute, election of the senior vice president should be done within five days of the president’s election. The senior vice president is elected from the executive committee, though the rest of the posts are filled through direct election.
According to FNCCI sources, there is general consensus among FNCCI members to select Bhawani Rana for the post of senior vice president. Leaders of the largest private sector umbrella body have claimed that rifts and groupism that occurred during the past elections will be bridged after the selection of a unanimous chief at FNCCI.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/mahat-pandey-say-no-clash-between-them/,"KATHMANDU: Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat and Minister for Foreign Affairs Mahendra Bahadur Pandey on Sunday said that the government was doing preparations for the donors’ conference to be held on June 25 in Kathmandu and that there was no clash or differences between them as reported by a section of the media.
Nepal is hosting the Donors’ Conference for the reconstruction of the country in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes.
“Media reports that there was clash between us and there was lack of coordination while sending invitations to neighbouring countries are baseless. The finance minister and I were supposed to go to India and China respectively. But, I cancelled my visit to China after Chinese authorities informed us that Chinese foreign minister will not be able to participate in the conference due to prior engagement,” Pandey told the meeting of
National Disaster Management and Monitoring Special Committee of the Legislature Parliament headed by Speaker Subas Chandra Nembang today.
Finance Minister Mahat said that his ministry had prepared the 300-page Post Disaster Need Assessment, with the help of more than 200 experts divided into 23 sub-panels by working round the clock in view of the conference. “This is the official document of the government detailing the damage and need assessment. This document has created the base to see support from donor countries and inter-country agencies,” Mahat said.
The government has invited 65 countries and inter-governmental agencies, said Finance Mahat, adding: “Of them, 125 delegates of 40 countries and agencies have already expressed their commitment to participate in the conference”. Seven minister-level participants have sent their confirmation to participate in the conference, according to Mahat.
“Initially, donor countries wished to delay the conference to August-September. Citing the devastating earthquake situation, they proposed to hold the conference in New Delhi of India, Tokyo of Japan and Paris of France. They were reluctant to participate in the conference expressing their doubt over the safety of the participants as the situation had not been normal. However, we persistently stood on our stance of holding the conference in Kathmandu and made all arrangements for their safe living during their stay here. Ultimately, the donors were convinced and are expressing their commitment for their participation,” Mahat said.
Mahat said that the government would focus on foreign grant collection, sharing experiences of managing post-disaster situation and solidarity of friendly nations to Nepal’s crisis.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Pandey said that the government wanted to show the international community that the country was safe for tourism and it maintained complete harmony during the national crisis despite having around 125 different communities.
Mahat, responding to a complaint that Russian ambassador in Kathmandu did not get invitation till last Wednesday due to the government’s carelessness, said, “The government, six weeks ago, had emailed all the embassies and ambassadors in Kathmandu, making preliminary request to participate in the conference. The [Russian] ambassador had replied us via email that the country’s representative would not be able to participate in the conference due to pre-scheduled engagement on the conference day. Then, we did not send invitation to him. But, after we heard about the complaint, we have sent an invitation recently.”
Lawmakers including CPN-UML’s Madhav Kumar Nepal, Nepali Congress’s Ramchandra Paudel and Unified CPN-Maoist’s Girirajmani Pokharel, had urged the ministries to clarify the controversies related to the conference and suggested them to make the conference a success.
After listening to the two ministers, panel Chair Nembang instructed the government to take the neighboring countries and donors into confidence and also consultations with all the parties and take their feedback. Nembang also instructed the government to make an arrangement for making the foreign delegates observe the major tourist areas — both damaged and not damaged — independently during their visit to give a message that Nepal is safe for foreign tourists.

Chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission Anup Raj Sharma said freedom of expression was at the heart of human rights and the two were inseparable.
Sharma also said the government had failed to take any initiative to implement the recommendations it made earlier.
“The government is attempting to bring the rights body under its purview without endorsing its proposal for reforms and amendment to the NHRC  Act, to make the law contemporary. Transitional justice is in peril.  Conflict victims continue to await justice,” he said.
He said child marriage, chhaupadi practice,  allegations of witchcraft, gender-based violence and human trafficking were still rampant in the country. “Children are deprived of education and health services. Caste and gender discrimination, intimidation of sexual minorities, discrimination between women and men in issuing citizenship certificate have hit the human rights situation,” he said.
Sharma said political parties were responsible for rising corruption, abuse of authority and culture of impunity in the country, which he said was likely to make democracy a matter of past.
Speaking at an interaction on ‘Status of Freedom of Expression and Human Rights’, Sharma said no power, law and force could stop a person from ventilating his/her views. “Freedom of expression is one of the basic human rights. It is very unfortunate to make freedom of expression a topic of discussion,” he said.
“Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right includes freedom to articulate one’s opinions without any interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media, regardless of frontiers,” reads Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Sharma said free press and freedom of expression were two sides of a coin. The constitution has guaranteed the right to freedom of expression to every citizen.
Sharma underscored the need to uphold the right to freedom of expression to protect and promote human rights and press freedom in line with international norms and values. Nepal is one of the member states of United Nations and a member of the Human Rights Council.
The NHRC chief recalled the commitments made by the Government of Nepal in the council regarding the protection and promotion of human rights as well as other core issues associated with them. Nepal is scheduled to present its third cycle of Universal Periodic Review on its human rights records to the council in November. All member states are required to submit factual report on human rights to the council.
The report should reflect the real picture of the human rights situation. In order to take stock of current human rights situation of the country, the NHRC had organised seven provincial programmes, 18 district-level programmes and eight thematic programmes, besides reviewing the implementation status of recommendations made by Universal Periodic Review.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/constitutional-bench-quashes-petition-filed-by-former-princess/,"Kathmandu, February 7
Constitutional bench of the Supreme Court today quashed former princess Prerana Rajya Laxmi  Devi Singh’s petition she had filed to reclaim 15 ropani and one ana land gifted by her father Gyanendra Shah when he was the king.
Singh had filed the petition challenging the Supreme Court’s 5 January 2017 decision that ordered the government to nationalise 15 ropani and one ana land owned by Singh. She had filed the case at the Constitutional bench of the SC on 21 December 2018.
She had stated in her petition that the SC’s verdict of nationalising her 15 ropani and one ana land, also known as Vijayaghar in Chhauni, be declared ultra vires. She had urged the court to scrap the government’s decision of nationalising her property, which she got as a gift from her father.
She had stated in her petition that the ownership of the property was held by former king Birendra, which was transferred to her father, former king Gyanendra before it was gifted to her. She said  Nepal Trust Act, which came into force on 6 January 2008, was retroactively enforced from 1 June 2001, and hence it was illegal.
She stated in her petition that the Supreme Court’s conclusion that sections 4 (1) and (2) of Nepal Trust Act-2008, have retroactive effects, which allowed nationalisation of her property, and were unconstitutional and unfair. Hence, these  two provisions should be declared ultra vires.
Singh had stated in her petition that the government decided only on 25 October 2010 to nationalise property held by former king Birendra, former queen Aishwarya and his family members, but she had acquired the property as a gift before 6 January 2008.
She had also argued that the government only had the legal mandate to manage the property held by Birendra, Aishwarya and their family on 6 January 2008, and not preceding the date.
She argued as per Article 27 of the Constitution of Nepal, which was in force till 15 January 2007, the properties of the royal family were inviolable. She said there was no prevailing law before 3 March 2002, that allowed nationalisation of the royal family’s property.
She said that Vijayaghar was inherited by Birendra and was his personal property. A full bench of then chief justice Sushila Karki and justices Deepak Kumar Karki and Sapana Pradhan Malla had struck down the order of the bench led by then chief justice Ram Kumar Prasad Shah and justice Cholendra SJB Rana issued on 21 June 2015, that ordered the Nepal Trust to return the land to Singh.
The land situated in posh area of Tahachal is worth Rs one billion as per the current market rates.

Several plots of land in Lalita Niwas of Baluwatar that were acquired illegally have been pledged as collateral to obtain credit of Rs 2.41 billion from different banks and financial institutions, raising uncertainty about the recovery of these loans.
The report on the Lalita Niwas land-grab case prepared by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority shows that loans ranging from Rs 2 million to Rs 1.38 billion were issued using plots located in Baluwatar as collateral.
Even Navin Paudel, son of ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) General Secretary Bishnu Paudel, had obtained a loan of Rs 4.9 million from Yeti Development Bank by using land in Baluwatar as collateral.
It is not known whether banks and financial institutions will be able to auction the land if the borrowers default on loan payment.
“We are collecting the exact amount of loans disbursed by banks using land plots in Lalita Niwas as collateral. Bankers will soon sit with the government and Nepal Rastra Bank to seek a way out,” said Bhuvan Dahal, president of Nepal Bankers’ Association.
Meanwhile, officials at the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperative and Poverty Alleviation said BFIs could not auction the concerned plots in Lalita Niwas as the government had already seized those plots. “Banks might take the issue to the court and wait for a verdict. However, they cannot auction the land plots if borrowers fail to clear their loans,” said Janak Raj Joshi, spokesperson for the ministry.

According to the MoHP, the decision was made on February 2 as per the request of disbursement recommendation subcommittee headed by director general at the Department of Health Services, on the basis of details of beneficiaries received from Nursing and Social Security Division.
A copy of the decision circulated by the MoHP today said amount reimbursed to the government and private hospitals covered the period of first six months of the current fiscal. As many as 10,815 persons will benefit from the medical grant.
A directive endorsed by the government last year envisaged separate fund under the MoHP to provide financial assistance to needy citizens for their medical care.
Any beneficiary is entitled to grant amount of up to Rs 400,000 for the treatment of prescribed diseases within Nepal on the recommendation of a three-member committee led by the chief of the local level concerned.
A citizen suffering from cardiovascular disease, cancer, parkinson’s disease, alzheimer’s disease, spinal injury, head injury, renal ailment and sickle cell anemia may submit an application, accompanied by a recommendation of the local level, to the NSSD. Upon receipt of an application, NSSD makes recommendation to a government hospital for providing necessary treatment to the patient.
Each hospital designated by the government has established a separate focal point for effective arrangement of medical services to be provided to disadvantaged citizens. According to the directive, at least 1.5 per cent of total annual budget of the DoHS shall be appropriated for the programme.

Conflict Victims National Alliance today staged a sit-in outside the prime minister’s official residence in Baluwatar to press the government to amend the Transitional Justice Act at the earliest.
Besides conflict victims, civil society members and rights activists also participated in the protest.
CVNA Senior Vice President Phanindra Luitel said the protest was held from 9:00am to 10:00am at Baluwatar to press the government to be serious about the transitional justice process.
Even after more than four years of their formation, two transitional justice bodies Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons, have failed to investigate a single case. They have collected more than 63,000 complaints of rights violation during the 10-year Maoist insurgency that lasted from 1996 to 2006. One of the major reasons for the failure of the commissions is lack of necessary legislation.
The Supreme Court verdicts state there should not be amnesty for grave human rights violations such as extra-judicial killing, enforced disappearance, torture, rape and other acts of sexual violence; the statute of limitations for grave offences must be removed; cases recommended by the TRC and CIEDP must be prosecuted; torture and enforced disappearance must be criminalised through enactment of laws; cases before the court cannot be transferred to the TRC or CIEDP; dignified and respectable reparation for victims and no reconciliation without the consent of victims.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/arrest-warrant-issued-against-former-dsp-accused-of-rape/,"Kathmandu, February 6
A 21-year-old girl has filed an FIR against former DSP Rajkumar Khiuju, accusing him of raping her multiple times over a period of five months at several places, including a police station in Chapagaun Police Circle, Lalitpur.
A permanent resident of Thula Durlung of Mahankal Rural Municipality in Lalitpur, the victim has accused Khiuju of raping her for the first time on February 13 last year at the police station. She claimed that she had visited the police station to obtain a document stating that she was not involved in any kind of illegal activities.
A close aide of the victim and a women’s rights activist, who has been supporting the victim in the case, alleged while talking to THT that Khiuju had lured the girl inside his office promising to issue the police report and raped her there.
Senior Superintendent of Police Durga Singh at the MPR-Jawalakhel said, “The girl has stated in her FIR that she was lured into the DSP’s room, where he first offered her coffee and later raped her.”
Her police report, however, was issued by Metropolitan Police Range, Jawalakhel. According to the FIR, the last time Khiuju had raped her was towards the end of June 2019, in her rented room at Satdobato. “She has complained of being raped multiple times during the five month period,” SP Singh said. The victim after filing the FIR yesterday was taken to the Patan Hospital for health check-up.
Lalitpur District Court has issued arrest warrant against Khiuju today. SP Singh said, “We are working to arrest the accused with the support of Bhaktapur police and investigate the case.”
The victim’s close aide said, “The girl was intimidated by the first incident of rape. Khiuju took advantage of that and then raped her repeatedly. He either visited the girl’s rented room or ordered her to visit his police station, where he raped her.”
“He had also made a video of the girl being raped and often threatened her of leaking the video on the social media,” said the aide, who represents National Forum for Women Rights Concern Nepal.
According to the victim’s aide, Khiuju also threatened the victim’s illiterate parents not to disclose the matter. “He had threatened the girl’s parents of putting them behind the bars and even murdering them if they disclosed the matter,” the aide told THT.
Police sources said Khiuju was transferred to Biratnagar after the issue surfaced within the police circle. Khiuju resigned around one-and-a-half months ago citing ‘domestic reasons’, but sources said he quit the job after the alleged victim started visiting various police stations in Kathmandu demanding action against him. Khiuju could not be reached for his comment.
The victim also filed an FIR against journalist Raju Basnet.
Basnet is accused of colluding with Khiuju for mounting pressure on her not to disclose the incident.
Basnet, who was at the MPR- Jawalakhel today, was clueless as to why he was implicated in the case.
He denied the accusation and said, “The girl (the victim) had approached me once to get her story published in my newspaper, but I had refused to do so.”

“The CIAA filing this case at the honourable Special Court will weaken the democratic system.

“The most powerful authority who is responsible for making the ultimate decision remains untouched. We condemn such actions and will obstruct the House today in protest.”
It is to be noted that former Deputy Prime Minister and NC Vice President Bijay Kumar Gachhadar is among 175 people who were booked for their role in the controversial case. The CIAA on Wednesday had filed complaint against these individuals.
On Wednesday, NC Spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma had registered dissent through a tweet over CIAA’s action suggesting that the commission giving a clean chit to Bishnu Poudel while accusing Gacchadar was unfair.

Marriageable age in Nepal as stipulated by the law is 20. A study conducted by the National Child Rights Council on news reports covered by various newspapers on child marriage revealed that 116 minors were married off in 22 districts.
The study covered a period from mid-August to mid-November. “Incidents of child marriage must be higher as many incidents go unreported,” read the NCRC report. Total 72 underage girls and boys tied knot in 36 incidents of child marriage.
Three minor girls were married off to men much older to them, while 41 girls were also married off to adult men, said National Child Rights Council spokesperson Ram Bahadur Chand.
Among those married before the age of majority, 78 persons had married voluntarily while 38 were subjected to pressure by their parents. According to the report on child marriage, 36 were boys while 80 girls. Morang district recorded the highest cases of child marriage. Twenty-two undergage persons tied knot in the district.
Nepal Police has been providing counseling for some of the children who were married at an early age, as well as for their guardians. Police officials have urged the guardians to ensure that the married children got education, according the report.
Due to easy access to information and communication technology, trend of underage children getting married voluntarily has increased across the country in the recent years, according to National Child Rights Council . Many national and international organisations active in Nepal have been running programmes aimed at controlling child marriage.

Former prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal described tourism as the backbone for the country’s economic development and suggested the government to prepare programmes for the promotion of tourism in coordination with all three levels of the government.
He also stressed the need to improve facilities for tourists. He said road infrastructure should be upgraded and tourists should be treated in civilised manner. “We should provide clean and green environment for the tourists besides so that they are enticed to extend their stay in Nepal” he added.

Veteran journalist Durganath Sharma, whose dulcet voice that emanated from television reverberated through Nepali drawing rooms in the late 1980s and 1990s, passed away today. He was 72.
Sharma was one of the first two news anchors when state-run Nepal Television went on air with its maiden news bulletin on 29 December 1985.
Durganath anchored NTV’s prime time news bulletin for decades, but he was known to a large number of Nepalis as someone who explained world events through his popular weekly TV programme called ‘Bishwa Ghatana’ which was broadcast every Thursday evening.
As a pioneer and veteran television anchor and journalist, he has inspired generations of young broadcast journalists. But before carving out a career as a television journalist, he had also left an indelible impression among Nepalis in the 1980s as a news anchor for state-run Radio Nepal.
“Sharma’s versatility and outstanding performance not only took NTV to new heights, but set a new benchmark for presenters and journalists at Radio Nepal,” said Sharma’s colleague and senior journalist Dhurba Hari Adhikari.
Thousands of his fans, journalists and even prominent personalities took to the social media today to extend their condolences to his family.
“I am deeply saddened by the demise of journalist Durganath Sharma, a pioneer of television journalism. I express heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family. His creativity in television journalism will always be remembered,” Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli tweeted.
Born in Fikkal, Ilam, in 1947, Sharma, began his journalism career in the late 1960s as a part-time employee of Gorkhapatra. Over the years, he rose to the post of the general manager at NTV and remained there for five years in two stints. Sharma retired as an active journalist in 2005 and started teaching journalism. He also started writing columns for national dailies after that.
He has written four books, including Bina Rahadaaniko Bidesh Yatra, Barsa Aamsanchar Ma, and Handbook on Broadcast Journalism.
He published a mémoire, Chhal, around two years ago.
Sharma, who had undergone open heart surgery around 24 years ago, was admitted to Gangalal Hospital last Thursday after he complained of chest pain and difficulty in urination. He was transferred to Manmohan Hospital at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital yesterday, after his condition worsened. He breathed his last at around 11:00 am today.

Following persons/organisations have been named defendants for recovering land from them. The CIAA said it named them defendants as the land plots on the Lalita Niwas premises have been transferred in their names. As per the charge-sheet, they do not have direct involvement in corruption as per the Prevention of Corruption Act-2002. Government-owned and public land plots have been transferred in their names. The individuals, while registering their statements with the CIAA said they were not willing to return those land  plots to the government. Therefore, as per the Prevention of Corruption  Act-2002, the CIAA has demanded that the court issued order to get the land plots registered in the name of the government.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/mps-raise-issues-of-public-concern/,"Kathmandu, February 4
Lawmakers today drew the attention of the government to various issues of public concern.
Speaking at the zero hour of the House of Representatives, lawmaker Dila Sangraoula asked the government to inform the Parliament whether the private medical colleges had refunded additional fees to the students or not. “The government, medical colleges and guardians had inked a tripartite agreement to refund the extra fees charged to the students.
I want the government to inform the lower house on the implementation status of the agreement,” she said.
On November 25, the Ministry of Home Affairs had decided to initiate action against medical colleges if they failed to return the extra money taken from students within 24 hours.
Minister of Home Affairs Ram Bahadur Thapa, Minister of Education, Science and Technology Giriraj Mani Pokharel, Attorney General Agni Kharel and other officials of stakeholder agencies were present at the meeting. Medical students had been protesting against their colleges for weeks demanding refund of extra fees.
A Cabinet meeting, last year, capped MBBS fees at Rs 3.85 million in Kathmandu valley and Rs 4.24 million outside the valley.
Students, however, complained that colleges had collected Rs 1.2 to Rs 1.5 million extra amount from them. MBBS fees for this year have been set at Rs 4.02 million inside the valley and Rs 4.44 million outside the valley.
Lawmaker Dal Bahadur Rana said most of the ministries had yet to develop their plans and programmes.
“There are only five months left to spend the budget allocated for the current fiscal. I would like to draw serious attention of the Ministry of Finance and the concerned ministries for proper utilisation of the budget. Poor spending of budget will lead infrastructure development plans to nowhere,” he said.
Lawmaker Dil Kumari urged the government to stop illegal sand mining from the rivers in Tarai to protect the environment.
She also raised the issue of the January 10 killing of Dilip Kumar Mahato, 26, of Mithila-5, in Dhanusha district and demanded the concerned authority to make public its investigation report. Mahato was crushed to death by a tipper for raising voice against illegal extraction of river products.
Lawmakers Durga Paudel and Dev Prasad Timalsena called on the government to ensure that sugarcane farmers got their outstanding dues cleared by sugar mills at the earliest.
Farmers have been claiming that sugar mills owe them around Rs 1.5 billion. Hundreds of cane farmers from across the country were in the capital last month. They protested against sugar mills, demanding clearance of the dues. However, they have yet to get full payment from the sugar mills.
The lawmakers also stressed on the need to provide support price and subsidy for the farmers, besides initiating action against the defaulters.
Lawmaker Nirudevi Pal praised the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens for its move to demolish chhau sheds in the Far-west and Mid- Western regions.
According to her, the local administration, in association with police, have destroyed 8,700 chhau sheds in 12 districts in less than two month period. In December, the MoHA had directed all district administration offices of the Sudurpaschim province to initiate stringent action against anyone who encouraged or practised chhaupadi.
The MoHA had directed DAOs to eliminate superstition and taboo associated with menstruation. The local administration was tasked to identify and destroy all chhau sheds.
Though the Supreme Court ruled chhaupadi illegal in 2005, it is still prevalent in some parts of Sudurpashim province.

Six former vice-chancellors of Tribhuvan University have requested the government not to endorse the Higher Education Bill tabled at the House of Representatives.
Former vice-chancellors Mahesh Kumar Upadhayay, Kedar Bhakta Mathema, Kamal Krishna Joshi, Nabin Jung Shahi, Hari Bahadur Maharjan and Tirtha Khaniya, at a press meet this evening, said the bill had provided ample space for political parties to influence educational institutes.
“The bill has clearly exposed the interest of the government to control the high education system, which cannot be accepted,” read release.
The vice-chancellors were particularly against the clause in the bill, which states that 25 per cent senate members of any university can remove vice-chancellor if they are not satisfied with the VC’s work.

The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority arrested the Chief Administrative Officer of Chandragiri Municipality and his driver for their alleged involvement in bribery yesterday.
According to the anti-graft body, CAO Yubaraj Paudel and driver Sanchit Dulal were taken into custody from Balambu with bribe amount Rs 100,000 they received from a service seeker.
Joint Secretary Pradip Kumar Koirala, CIAA spokesperson, said Paudel had ordered his driver to receive the bribe from the service seeker as kickback for sanctioning amount for broadcasting public service announcement.
Last week, the CIAA had arrested Krishna Bahadur KC, chairperson of Junichande Rural Municipality in Jajarkot district with bribe of Rs 800,000, he had received from a service seeker for sanctioning budget for construction of a road. The anti-graft body said further investigation into the case was under way to file a charge-sheet against KC at the Special Court.
A recent study by the CIAA showed corruption was rampant at local levels where office-bearers and employees rarely provided service without bribe.
According to the ‘Study on Corruption at Local Levels’, the amount of bribe given to the concerned officials depended on the nature of service sought by a service seeker.
Most of the money accumulated by local level office-bearers come from contractors. They indulge in corruption from formulation to implementation of development plans.
The anti-graft body said corruption had been a defining feature of governance at local levels. The tendency of formulating politically motivated laws instead of considering people’s larger benefit has institutionalised corruption, according to the CIAA.

People living a sedentary lifestyle and those indulging in smoking and drinking are more likely to suffer from cancer, according to doctors.
According Global Cancer Observatory, an interactive web-based platform, there were 26,184 new cases of cancer in Nepal in 2018, of which 19,413 people died.

“Early detection of cancer helps cure the disease,” said Dr Kapendra Shekhar Amatya, Head of Surgical Oncology Department at Nepal Cancer Hospital and Research Centre in Lalitpur.
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018, according to World Health Organisation. Sharing the experience of cancer survivors amidst an event organised at the hospital today, Bimala Thapa one of the cancer survivors said, “When I came to know that I had cancer I felt that my life had come to an end. My relatives started treating me in a different manner. But I ultimately won the battle against cancer.”
Another cancer patient Basudev Pathak said, “Motivation and strong determination are necessary to fight cancer.”
Doctors have advised people to change their lifestyle and to exercise regularly to reduce risk of cancer.
Annual health check-up is necessary for an early diagnosis of for cancer. They also said cancer patients should not be stigmatised.
“The disease is curable. One needs to visit doctor regularly for an early detection and timely treatment of the disease,” said Dr Sudip Shrestha, executive chairman of Nepal Cancer Hospital and Research Centre.
The hospital had organised an event today to celebrate World Cancer Day. The theme for World Cancer Day 2020 is ‘I Am and I Will.’ According to WHO, cancer is the second leading cause of death globally. It was responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Globally, about one in six deaths is due to cancer.
Approximately 70 per cent of deaths from cancer occur in lowand middle-income countries.
Around one-third of deaths from cancer are mainly due to high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use.

Ganga Maya Adhikari, seeking the United Nation’s role in ensuring justice for her son Krishna Prasad Adhikari, who was murdered during the Maoist insurgency, today met UN Resident Coordinator Valerie Julliand at UN House, Pulchowk.
Krishna Prasad was kidnapped and killed by the then Maoist rebels in Chitwan in June 2004. Ganga Maya was accompanied to the UN House by lawyers and rights activists, including Charan Prasai, Om Prakash Aryal, Indra Aryal, Badri Bhusal, Sabitri Shrestha and Aasik Ram Karki.
During the meeting, Adhikari put forth her plight besides raising the issue of the stalled justice process in Nepal, according to Prasai.
“She sought positive role of the UN to ensure justice for her during the meeting that lasted for around an hour,” said Prasai. According to Prasai, Julliand pledged every possible help from her side to ensure justice is delivered.
Gangya Maya, who staged fast-unto-death protests many times demanding the government arrest and prosecute murderer(s) of her son, has concluded that the state is unwilling and unable to deliver justice in her son’s murder case, according to Prasai.
Krishna Prasad’s parents waited for almost seven years to bring the culprits to justice.
But as the state did not take any initiative to arrest the murderers, they began their hunger strike in January 2013.
Their strike ended after 47 days following the government’s commitment to ensure justice.
But after the main accused, Chhabilal Poudel, was released on bail, the Adhikari couple resumed their hunger strike. As the hunger strike entered the 334th day, Ganga Maya’s husband breathed his last. His body has been lying unclaimed at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital since his death on 22 September 2014.

Lawmakers in the House of Representatives today lambasted the government for the delay in evacuating Nepalis living in Hubei Province of China.
They also criticised the government for its inability to decide a place to quarantine China returnees.
They demanded for immediate evacuation of the Nepalis living in Hubei Province, an epicentre of the novel coronavirus disease outbreak.
Answering to questions raised by 14 lawmakers in the Parliament today Minister of Health and Population Bhanubhakta Dhakal said the government should evacuate the Nepalis in China with precaution.
“The government has been working to bring the Nepalis home without delay. We need to be alert and should adopt precautionary measures to bring them and also to prevent the disease from spreading,” said minister Dhakal.
“We have been thinking to quarantine Nepalis from China in places away from human settlement. They will be kept in isolation for 14 days. The place to quarantine them has almost been finalised,” said Dhakal.
Minister Dhakal said the government needed to coordinate with its Chinese counterpart to bring the Nepalis from their place of residence to the airport, back in China and then to Nepal. “There is still a lockdown in Wuhan. We also need to ensure the safety of those who will receive the Nepalis returning home from China,” the minister said.
According to the minister evacuated people will be will be taken to the place of quarantine in closed vehicles.
Lawmaker Devendra Raj Kandel said, “The Chinese government built a 1,000-bed hospital in a few days. It seems like the Nepali government will take 1,000 days to find a place to quarantine Nepalis coming from China.”
Responding to the lawmaker, minister Dhakal said, “Nepal government can’t act at the same speed as that of the Chinese government. However, we have made preparation to prevent the disease from spreading in the country.”
Responding to questions by the lawmakers about the government’s plan to prevent disease from spreading from people coming to Nepal from 24 other countries where it has been confirmed, Minister Dhakal said the medical team deployed at Tribhuvan International Airport would check the persons at its health desk.
Anyone with symptoms of the disease would be immediately sent to hospital.
The government has vacated 43 beds in hospitals across the country as part of its plan to treat people suffering from the new disease.
At least 190 cases of the disease have been reported in over two dozen countries.
Two people, one in Philippines and the other in the semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong have died outside mainland China since the outbreak began.

Parliamentary Committee on Women and Social Welfare has directed the government to bring Nepal Children’s Organisation under the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens. The committee has called for immediate implementation of its directive.
The committee also directed the ministry to take responsibility for protecting organisation’s children and taking ownership of all its immovable and movable property.

Following a discussion with the organisation’s officials, the committee instructed the ministry to make all the necessary arrangements at the provincial and local levels.
The committee has concluded that though the organisation with its decades long history has been taking responsibility of hundreds of children, it failed to upgrade itself as per the new rules of the government.
The committee also suggested that all the structures to be built should be child-friendly and child care homes must meet the minimum criteria before coming into operation.
These child care homes must ensure basic rights to health, education and so on.
Besides, it advised the government to ensure that non-government organisations meant for children’s welfare in the country should maintain transparency. The ministry and Social Welfare Council have been directed to publish updates of child care homes every three months as per the provision of Right to Information Act to ensure decent treatment of children. It has also told the government to monitor these organisations regularly.
Earlier, Minister of Women, Children and Senior Citizens Parbat Gurung had advised the organisation’s representatives to cooperate with the government to bring the organisation under the ministry.
Recently, it had come to the light that the organisation’s officials and employees were providing scholarship quotas meant for orphans to their children or the children of their kith and kin.
Presently, the organisation houses around 400 children.

Oncologists have said that Nepal requires 29 radiation therapy machines to treat cancer patients.
Speaking at an event held in the Capital today oncologists said that the government must take measures to increase the number of radiation therapy machines across the country to provide timely services to patients.
“There are eight radiotherapy machines across the country. But the number of these machines is not sufficient as the number of cancer patients are increasing each day in the country,” said Dr Sandhya Chapagain, associate professor, Department of Oncology, NAMS, Bir Hospital. “Lack of radiation machines in cancer hospitals has increased waiting time for patients. A patient has to wait at least two-and-a-half months to get radiation therapy. Lack of timely treatment affects patients,” she added.
According to Globocan 2018, there were 26,184 new cases of cancer in Nepal of which 19,413 people died. The Global Cancer Observatory is an interactive web-based platform presenting global cancer statistics to inform cancer control and research. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018, according to World Health Organisation.
Doctors have said that early detection of cancer helps cure most of the cancer.
“Thirty to 50 per cent of cancer is preventable.
Early detection reduces familial and individual stress, reduces premature deaths by reducing the gap between productive age and the geriatric population,” she said. Doctors have pointed out that incidence of cancer is increasing due to increasing population and life expectancy and also because of increase in diagnostic modality.
According to WHO, cancer is the second leading cause of death globally. It was responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Globally, about one in six deaths is due to cancer.
Approximately 70 per cent of deaths from cancer occur in low- and middle-income countries. Around one-third of deaths from cancer are mainly due to high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use.

BANGKOK: Thai doctors have seen success in treating severe cases of the new coronavirus with combination of medications for flu and HIV, with initial results showing vast improvement 48 hours after applying the treatment, they said on Sunday.
The doctors from Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok said a new approach in coronavirus treatment had improved the condition of several patients under their care, including one 70-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who tested positive for the coronavirus for 10 days.
The drug treatment includes a mixture of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, in combination with flu drug oseltamivir in large doses.
“This is not the cure, but the patient’s condition has vastly improved. From testing positive for 10 days under our care, after applying this combination of medicine the test result became negative within 48 hours,” Dr. Kriangska Atipornwanich, a lung specialist at Rajavithi, told reporters.
“The outlook is good but we still have to do more study to determine that this can be a standard treatment.”
Chinese health officials have already been administering the HIV and flu drugs to fight the coronavirus. The use of the three together in a cocktail seemed to improve the treatment, the Thai doctors said.
Another doctor said that a similar approach in two other patients resulted in one displaying some allergic reaction but the other showed improvement.
“We have been following international practices, but the doctor increased the dosage of one of the drugs,” said Somsak Akkslim, director-general of the Medical Services Department, referring to the flu medicine Oseltamivir.
Thailand has recorded 19 cases of coronavirus. Of the Thai patients, eight have recovered and gone home while 11 are still under treatment in hospitals.
Somsak said the health ministry will meet on Monday to discuss the successful treatment in the case of the 70-year-old but said it is still too soon to say that this approach can be applied to all cases.
“Initially we will apply this approach only to severe cases,” he said.

BENGALURU/ NEW DELHI: One of India‘s most famous universities is half-empty and some students who are on campus track each other on mobile devices to ensure people are safe, as violent clashes spill on to campuses that are seen as a hotbed of anti-government protests.
The country has been rocked by demonstrations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s new citizenship law that some say discriminates against Muslims. At least 25 people have died and thousands of people have been arrested.
Many of the most visible and persistent protests have been in and around universities, and some students now fear for their safety following clashes with police and unidentified mobs in recent weeks.
“I don’t think I can ever feel completely safe, either in the girls’ hostel or on campus,” said Nayla Khwaja, a student at New Delhi’s renowned Jamia Millia Islamia university.
Last month police smashed their way into the institution, firing tear gas shells as scores of terrified students barricaded doors and hid inside bathrooms.
Weeks on from the violence, large parts of the college remain deserted, with some parents refusing to allow students who flock to the university from all parts of India to return.
Less than half of the 20,000-strong student population is back on campus for the new semester, according to college chief proctor Waseem Ahmad Khan.
Beyond the capital, protests have also erupted in colleges in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Chennai.
In some cases they have spilled into nearby town squares, with citizens holding Indian flags and demanding the revocation of the law in the most sustained opposition to Modi since he first swept to power in 2014.
Students say they are concerned about further attacks which they blame on right-wing groups tied to the ruling Hindu nationalists.
“There is an environment of fear that was never seen before,” said Saheb Samanta, a PHD scholar in Kolkata’s Jadavpur University.
Students have taken to sharing live locations on WhatsApp with friends when attending a protest or going to class so they know who is where, a dozen students enrolled in universities in Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata told Reuters.
“We are keeping some basic checks in place. Letting friends know where we are and also sometimes walking in groups within campus. This really wasn’t necessary before,” said a masters student at Jadavpur University.
Like others who described the extra precautions, she declined to give her name out of concern for her safety.
DEEP ANXIETY AMONG MUSLIMS
Critics say that Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government is targeting universities to snuff out dissent before the opposition to his policies gets out of hand.
BJP spokesman Tom Vadakkan rejected the allegation and said rival political parties were trying to use students as a way to settle political scores with it.
“These parties are trying to stay relevant,” he said.
The citizenship law lays out a path to Indian nationality for six religious groups from neighbouring countries but not Muslims, prompting criticism it undermines the country’s secular ethos.
It came months after the government withdrew the special status of Muslim-majority Kashmir and also after the country’s top court ruled in favour of Hindus in a decades-old dispute over a place of worship that the ruling party has long campaigned for.
Such moves have stirred deep anxiety among India‘s Muslim population and liberals that Modi is promoting a Hindu-first agenda in a country that celebrated its rich diversity.
But the government has said the citizenship law is aimed at helping minorities like Hindus, Christians and Sikhs who face persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
Even small colleges in cities like Bengaluru, far from the centre of the protests in the capital, have been caught up in the unrest. Some government supporters accuse anyone opposing the citizenship law as anti-national.
This month, a group of 15 men showed up at the gates of Jyoti Nivas, a small all-women’s college, demanding students sign up a charter supporting the citizenship law.
They held a banner with a picture of Modi and insisted women show support for the law.
“We said they can’t force us to sign because we are not for the CAA ( citizenship amendment act),” said Soorya, a 21-year-old student who did not want to share her last name.
There was an altercation and college authorities ordered classes to be suspended for the next two days.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong protesters marched through shopping malls on New Year’s Eve urging people not to give up the fight for democracy in 2020, while police were out in force across the city to quell any unrest.
As evening fell, dozens of protesters dropped flowers near the Prince Edward metro station, which was the scene of some of the most violent clashes with the police this summer.
Demonstrators plan a giant human chain later on as well as late-night demonstrations dubbed “Suck the Eve” in the downtown bar and entertainment district of Lan Kwai Fong and the picturesque Victoria Harbour.
Wong, a 22-year-old freelance photographer who gave only his last name, said he did not feel like celebrating New Year.
“I can’t even celebrate my birthday. I choose to stand here because at least we can chant a little and it feels like I’m with family,” he said.
The protests began in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, and have evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.
Many streets were decorated with Christmas lights and other seasonal paraphernalia, but the mood on Tuesday was less than festive as officers in riot gear patrolled the busiest areas.
In a prime shopping mall in the Tsim Sha Tsui area popular with tourists, dozens of protesters chanted pro-democracy slogans and riot police stopped people to search their backpacks.
Authorities have cancelled the popular midnight fireworks for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns.
The fireworks usually draw thousands of locals and tourists to the harbour front and the countdown is broadcast worldwide.
They will be replaced with “Symphony of Lights”, a multimedia light show involving projections on the city’s tallest skyscrapers at the stroke of midnight.
The facade of the waterside Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre was turned into a giant countdown clock.
“Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time is my New Year wish,” said 30-year-old Calvin, who attended a central lunchtime rally.
CARRIE LAM’S RESOLUTION
In a New Year’s Eve video message, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said more than six months of unrest in the Asian financial hub had caused sadness, anxiety, disappointment and rage.
“Let’s start 2020 with a new resolution, to restore order and harmony in society. So we can begin again, together,” said Lam in the 3-minute address.
“Hong Kong people have resolved many difficulties before. With our resilience and wisdom I believe we can once again overcome our current challenges and rebuild Hong Kong.”
Police say they have arrested nearly 6,500 people since the protests began escalating in what is the worst political crisis faced by the city in decades.
On Jan. 1, tens of thousands of people are expected to join a major pro-democracy march, after it received police approval to proceed.
The previous such march by organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), in early December, drew an estimated 800,000 people.
The New Year demonstrations follow a pick-up in clashes since Christmas Eve, when riot police fired tear gas at thousands of protesters following scuffles in shopping malls and in a prime tourist district.
“On New Year’s Day, we need to show our solidarity … to resist the government. We hope Hong Kong people will come onto the streets for Hong Kong‘s future,” said CHRF leader Jimmy Sham.

HONG KONG: Hundreds of protesters marched through Hong Kong shopping malls on Thursday, disrupting business in the Asian financial hub for a third day over the festive period and prompting riot police to close off a mall in a tourist district.
The “shopping protests” have targeted malls across the Chinese-ruled city since Christmas Eve, turning violent at times with police firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators in areas filled with shoppers and visitors.
While the turnout on Thursday was smaller than on the previous two days, riot police stepped up patrols at shopping centers on the Kowloon peninsula and in the rural New Territories.
Dozens of police with batons and shields surrounded and sealed off the Langham Place shopping mall in Kowloon’s Tsim Sha Tsui district after black-clad, masked protesters occupied it.
“I think the purpose for us to come out is to… let people realize that so many front-line protesters sacrificed (things) for them. They should not forget and (simply) celebrate Christmas,” said Sandy, a young demonstrator who wore a black mask to hide her identity.
“…We have been fighting for almost seven months now, and the Hong Kong police have done so many bad things.”
The protests began more than six months ago in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
They have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement, and became more confrontational over the festive season. Earlier in December, after pro-democracy candidates overwhelmingly won district council elections, they had been largely peaceful.
Many protesters have been angered by what they see as the use of unnecessary force by the police, and demanded an independent inquiry into the force’s behaviour.
Police, who say they have used only minimum force to control the protests, on Thursday detained several people at a mall in rural Tai Po, north of the city’s financial center, public broadcaster RTHK said.
Demonstrators are also angry at what they perceive as increased meddling by Beijing in freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering, saying it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula put in place at that time, and blames foreign forces for fomenting unrest.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam condemned the protesters in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying many Hong Kongers and tourists were disappointed their Christmas Eve celebrations had been ruined, while local businesses had also been hit.
On Thursday, some restaurants and stores pulled down their shutters in the malls as protesters, some wearing balaclavas and carrying black flags, marched by.
The government on Thursday criticized “unprecedented violence” by some protesters, but said that protecting freedoms and human rights remained a top priority.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/earthquake-rattles-afghanistan-pakistan-and-indian-kashmir/,"ISLAMABAD/KABUL: An earthquake shook some buildings in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Kashmir state in India on Friday, witnesses said.
The magnitude 6.1 quake was centred in mountainous Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan, at a depth of 210 km (130 miles), the US Geological Survey said.
Officials in Kabul said they were assessing damage in areas around the sparsely populated epicentre. In Pakistan, tremors shook furniture and power cable poles. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Waseem Ahmad, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority in Islamabad, estimated the quake to be about 6.4 magnitude.
“I was with my kids at a badminton court when we felt strong jolts,” said Nusrat Jabeen in Pakistan‘s capital. “It was very scary. We felt everything was shaking. We ran out for safety.”
Tremors were also felt in India’s mountainous Kashmir state where people rushed out of their homes and offices. The Indian subcontinent has suffered some of the largest earthquakes in the world.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/veteran-climbers-skeptical-that-proposed-rules-for-mount-everest-will-stop-deaths/,"
KATHMANDU: Veteran climbers of Mount Everest are skeptical that proposed new regulations by the Nepalese government to tighten the permit process for adventurers will address the root causes of this year’s heavy death toll on the world’s tallest peak.
American mountaineers Ed Viesturs and Alan Arnette said planned new laws – if they are introduced at all – are unlikely to tackle the growing trend of inexperienced climbers rushing in packs to scale the 29,035-foot (8,850-metre) Himalayan peak.
“I’ve seen this movie so many times it’s totally predictable,” Arnette told Reuters in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “Every year since 2013, something goes wrong and they (the Nepal government) announce all these new rules and never implement them.”
Eleven climbers died on Mount Everest this year – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side. Many perished when a rush to climb the mountain during a short window of suitable weather in late May led to a “traffic jam” near the summit.
“Most teams opt to go for the summit when the first weather window is predicted,” Viesturs told Reuters in one of a series of interviews by phone and email.
“Everyone is afraid of missing what might be the one and only perfect day. There are typically several good summit days, but there’s pressure to go when everyone else goes.”
Nepal has traditionally issued climbing permits to anyone prepared to pay the $11,000 fee, handing out a record 381 passes this year. With essential Sherpas and guides added, more than 800 people were trying to reach the summit during the short weather window.
TRAFFIC JAM IN THE DEATH ZONE
The overcrowding – which caught worldwide attention when a photograph of a queue of climbers stepping over bodies to reach the summit went viral – caused fatal delays in the thin air in what is known as the “death zone” above 8,000 metres. That raised concerns that inexperienced mountaineers were being encouraged to attempt the climb by unscrupulous guide companies.
Among the changes proposed by the Nepalese government is a requirement for climbers to submit a medical report by a certified doctor disclosing their history and state of health. Another suggested requirement was the climbers submit proof they had scaled another 6,500-metre peak in Nepal.
Arnette said the first change was unlikely to be enough, given the potential to forge medical documents, while the second made little sense as many climbers have scaled higher peaks elsewhere.
The recommendations have been submitted to the cabinet for approval, Mira Acharya, who oversees climbing activities for the Nepal government’s Department of Tourism, told Reuters last week. The government has not given a time frame for the introduction of new laws.
Viesturs, who has an extensive history on Everest, said the proposed changes did not do enough to tackle the “group think” pack mentality that led to the traffic jam in late May, a problem he said also needed to be addressed by climb leaders at base camp.
“I know several climbers who waited until later and had the mountain almost to themselves,” Viesturs said of this year’s climbing season. “We really need to answer why so many people are on the summit ridge on the same day? How can you control it?”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/charity-sues-kenya-over-treatment-of-trafficked-indian-nepali-women/,"NAIROBI: A charity said on Monday it is suing the Kenyan government over a failure to provide five women trafficked from India and Nepal for sexual exploitation with appropriate care after they were rescued.
HAART Kenya said a decision to make the three Nepali and two Indian women rescued from a Nairobi bar in August stay and testify against their alleged traffickers had caused them psychological harm.
“After four months, the victims just want to go home. They have become deeply traumatised and suicidal … some have been hospitalised,” said Sophie Otiende, programme consultant for HAART Kenya, which has rented a safe house for the victims.
“So we have filed a complaint against the government so that all victims of trafficking are not compelled to testify, and the government pays for their speedy and safe repatriation.”
The government has said it hopes to repatriate the five women, aged in their early to mid-twenties, in the coming days.
The petition, due to be heard on Tuesday, states that Kenya’s attorney general, inspector general of police and director of public prosecutions violated an anti-trafficking law that says victims have a right to privacy and safe repatriation.
It also calls on authorities to pay expenses of more than 1.3 million Kenyan shillings ($12,830) incurred by the charity for the care of the victims, which the law says is the state’s responsibility.
Kenyan government officials denied a lack of care and said no request for funds had been received.
“We have received requests from other charities which are being considered. If HAART approached us, we would of course consider providing funds for these victims,” said Elizabeth Mbuka, Head of the Counter Trafficking in Persons Secretariat.
Mbuka said a court order for the repatriation of the five women had now been given.
BOLLYWOOD BARS
A rising number of women and girls are leaving South Asian nations such as Nepal, India and Pakistan to work in Bollywood-style dance bars in Kenya’s adult entertainment industry – many illegally – according to anti-trafficking activists and police.
There is no official data, but the results of police raids combined with figures on repatriation of rescued women suggest scores of women and underage girls are victims of organised human trafficking from South Asia to Kenya.
Common in India, so-called mujra dance bars – where young women dance to Bollywood music for money from male patrons – have mushroomed in cities including Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, where large numbers of Kenyans of South Asian descent live.
Police and anti-trafficking groups have repeatedly voiced concerns that some of these private clubs are used as a front to ensnare women and girls, some in sex slavery, with women forced to pay off loans by erotic dancing or having sex with clients.
An official from the Indian High Commission in Nairobi said there had been “a few” cases involving the trafficking of Indian women to Kenyan dance bars.
“Whenever there is a case, we request consular access and provide whatever support we can to the victims,” said the official, who did not want to be named.
“We try to ensure that all Indian nationals go back as soon as possible, but we can only do this when the court orders this in the host country.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/powerful-quake-kills-13-in-albania-as-buildings-bury-residents/,"
TIRANA/THUMANE: At least 13 people were killed when the most powerful earthquake to hit Albania in decades shook the capital Tirana and the country’s west and north on Tuesday, tearing down buildings and burying residents under rubble.
Residents, some carrying babies, fled apartment buildings in Tirana and the western port of Durres after the 6.4 magnitude quake struck shortly before 4 a.m. (0300 GMT).
In the northern town of Thumane, Marjana Gjoka, 48, was sleeping in her apartment on the fourth floor of a five-storey building when the quake shattered the top floors.
“The roof collapsed on our head and I don’t know how we escaped. God helped us,” said Gjoka, whose three-year-old niece was among four people in the apartment when the quake struck.
The quake was centred 30 km (19 miles) west of Tirana, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said, and was also felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia.
Hours later a magnitude 5.4 earthquake hit Bosnia, with an epicentre 75 km (45 miles) south of Sarajevo, monitors said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
Five people were found dead in the rubble of apartment buildings in the northern Albanian town of Thumane and a man died in the town of Kurbin after jumping out of a building, a Defence Ministry spokeswoman said.
Seven bodies were pulled from collapsed buildings in Durres, the main port and tourism destination, the Defence Ministry said, adding 39 had been pulled out alive from under the ruins.
Defence Minister Olta Xhacka said 135 people were injured.
Firefighters, police and civilians were removing the debris from collapsed buildings in Thumane. Most of the buildings that collapsed were built of bricks, a Reuters reporter said.
Rescuers in Thumane used a mechanical digger to claw at collapsed masonry and remove a tangle of metal and cables. Others groped with bare hands to clear rubble.
Two people were pulled from rubble in Thumane four hours after the quake, a Reuters reporter said. Doctors said they were in a bad condition.
“Everything at home kept falling down,” Refik, a Tirana resident, said of the impact on his sixth-floor apartment.
“We were awake because of the previous quakes, but the last one shook us around,” he told Reuters, referring to smaller tremors recorded in the hour before the main quake.
Rescuers told local media one of the dead was an elderly woman who saved her grandson by cradling him with her body.
TRAPPED
Xhacka said the quake’s epicentre was in Durres. It was followed by 100 aftershocks.
“Durres and Thumane are the areas worst hit. Rescue-and-save work continues in the collapsed buildings there,” she said as troops pulled a victim from a hotel in Durres.
At least 135 people were injured, with 72 hospitalized, Xhacka said. Two planes from fellow NATO-member Romania were expected to land with specialized search and rescue equipment and help was coming from Italy and Turkey, Xhacka said.
Greece had sent emergency services for search and rescue operations, its premier’s office said.
“Firefighters and army staff are helping residents under the rubble”, in Durres and Thumane, the Defence Ministry said.
An unidentified man, with a wound dressing on his right cheek, told News24 TV his daughter and niece were among those trapped in a collapsed apartment building in Durres.
“I talked with my daughter and niece on the phone. They said they are well and are waiting for the rescue. Could not talk to my wife. There are other families, but I could not talk to them,” the man said.
Located along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, between Greece and Macedonia, Albania experiences regular seismic activity.
An earthquake of 5.6 magnitude shook the country on Sept. 21, damaging around 500 houses and destroying some. The Defence Ministry had said it was the most powerful quake in Albania in the last 30 years.
The images of collapsed buildings in urban areas suggested Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than one in 1979 which razed a neighbourhood of a northern town. Neither of those two earlier earthquakes caused fatalities.
The Balkan nation is the poorest country in Europe, with an average income of less than a third of the European Union average, according to Eurostat data.

SYDNEY: Firefighters battled hundreds of bushfires across Australia on Thursday as scores of blazes sprang up in new locations, triggering warnings that it was too late for some residents to evacuate.
As Thick smoke blanketed the most populous city of Sydney for a third day, residents were urged to keep children indoors, stepping up pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to tackle climate change.
By early afternoon, dozens of fires were burning across the southeastern state of Victoria and temperatures of 40.9 Celsius (105.6 F) in Melbourne, its capital, matched the hottest day on record in 1894, Australia‘s weather bureau said.
Authorities warned residents of towns about 50 km (31 miles) north of Ballarat, the state’s third largest city, that it was too late for them to evacuate safely.
“You are in danger, act now to protect yourself,” fire authorities said in an alert. “It is too late to leave. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately.”
Blazes across several states have endangered thousands of people, killing at least four people this month, burning about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroying more than 400 homes.
The early arrival and severity of the fires in the southern hemisphere spring follows three years of drought that experts have linked to climate change and which have left bushland tinder-dry.
With 10 days remaining to the official start of summer, extreme temperatures and high winds have sparked wildfires in new areas, even as firefighters tracked the crisis across the mainland, the Northern Territory and the island of Tasmania.
In Victoria, power to more than 100,000 homes was knocked out amid lightning strikes and strong, gusty winds of more than 110 kph (68 mph) that knocked tree branches into power lines, ahead of a cool change expected to bring relief in the evening.
The extensive damage was likely to leave some customers without power through the night as utilities worked to restore networks and fix downed powerlines, a spokeswoman for power provider Ausnet said.
State authorities issued its first Code Red alert in a decade, signifying the worst possible bushfire conditions, warning that should a fire start it would be fast moving, unpredictable and probably uncontrollable.
In the state of New South Wales, strong winds blew smoke from 60 fires still burning over much of Sydney, shrouding the harbour city and its famous landmarks in thick smog.
The state imposed tough new water curbs in Sydney from Dec. 10, when a key dam is expected to be down to 45% capacity. Residents face fines if they use hoses to water their gardens and wash their cars.
CLIMATE POLITICS
The unrelenting conditions have sharpened attention on the climate change policies of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who rejected any link.
“Climate change is a global phenomenon, and we’re doing our bit as part of the response to climate change,” Morrison told ABC radio.
“To suggest that, with just 1.3% of global emissions, that Australia doing something differently – more or less – would have changed the fire outcome this season, I don’t think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all.”
Morrison’s conservative government has committed to the Paris Agreement for a cut in emissions from 26% to 28% by 2030, versus 2005 levels. Critics say current projections suggest it will miss that target and have urged remedial steps.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/singapore-court-to-hear-legal-challenges-on-gay-sex-ban/,"KUALA LUMPUR: As a Singapore court prepares to hear a series of legal challenges to a law that bans gay sex, LGBT+ activists on Tuesday called for the “right” verdict to be delivered so similar reforms can be triggered across other parts of Asia.
Like many other former British colonies, Singapore has retained an old law that criminalises gay sex, which was scrapped by India in a landmark court ruling last year to give a boost to LGBT+ rights.
Empowered by the Indian ruling, three Singaporean activists have launched separate bids in a renewed push to decriminalise gay sex in the city-state, where a high court is due to begin hearing their cases on Wednesday.
“I think public opinion is pretty clear across religious and age segments that homosexuality should not be a criminal offence,” Johnson Ong Ming, who was among the trio, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Ong, a DJ also known as DJ Big Kid, was the first to launch the case in September last year. The former head of a LGBT+ rights charity and a retired doctor also filed similar lawsuits later.
“I have full confidence in our judicial system and I am hopeful that the court will come to the right decision … and overturn Section 377A,” Ong said by email.
The court has set aside six days in November for the legal challenges to be heard but it is unclear when the proceedings will wrap up.
Under Section 377A of Singapore’s Penal Code, a man found to have committed an act of “gross indecency” with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare. The law does not apply to homosexual acts between women.
Singapore has emerged as a modern nation since independence six decades ago but socially it remains conservative, partly due to sensitivities stemming from multi-religious groups among its 5.6 million population.
Previous legal challenges to overturn the ban have failed, although recent opinion polls indicated there has been growing support for gay rights.
Opposition to gay marriage had fallen to 60%, down from 74% in 2013, according to a poll of more than 4,000 people published in May by the Institute of Policy Studies, a Singapore think-tank.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong however has previously said that Singapore society “is not that liberal on these matters”.
The Singapore court cases are being closely watched by LGBT+ groups in some other parts of Asia that have maintained the colonial-era law, including in Myanmar and Malaysia.
“If the decision in Singapore goes our way, then it will boost our morale here in Malaysia,” said Numan Afifi, president of the LGBT+ advocacy Pelangi Campaign in Malaysia.
Aung Myo Min, executive director from the Yangon-based Equality Myanmar LGBT+ campaign group said both Singapore and Myanmar “should follow the example of India” and repeal the archaic law.
Gay sex is a crime in both countries, with those convicted facing sentences of up to 10 years in jail in Myanmar and 20 years in Malaysia.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/at-least-40-killed-as-fresh-protests-engulf-iraq-3/,"BAGHDAD: At least 40 protesters were killed in Iraq on Friday when security forces used tear gas and an Iranian-backed militia opened fire to try to quell renewed demonstrations against corruption and economic hardship, security sources said.

A government intelligence officer and a member of the powerful Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia were killed in a clash with protesters in the southern city of Amara, police sources said.
More than 2,000 people were injured nationwide, according to medical sources and the Iraqi High Commission on Human Rights (IHCHR), as demonstrators vented frustration at political elites they say have failed to improve their lives after years of conflict.
“All we want are four things: jobs, water, electricity, and safety. That’s all we want,” said 16-year-old Ali Mohammed who had covered his face with a T-shirt to avoid inhaling tear gas, as chaotic scenes overwhelmed Baghdad‘s central Tahrir Square.
Sirens wailed and tear gas canisters landed amid groups of young protesters draped in Iraqi flags and chanting “with life and blood we defend you Iraq.”
The bloodshed is the second major bout of violence this month. A series of clashes two weeks ago between protesters and security forces left 157 people dead and over 6,000 wounded.
The unrest has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which lived through foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State (IS) insurgency between 2003 and 2017. It is the biggest challenge to security since IS was declared beaten.
On Friday, eight protesters were killed in Baghdad, the IHCHR said. At least five of them were protesters struck by tear gas canisters, security sources said.
In the south, at least nine protesters were killed when members of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) militia opened fire on protesters who tried to set fire to the group’s office in the city of Nasiriya, according to security sources.
Eight people were killed in Amara city, including six protesters, one AAH member and one intelligence officer, police sources said. Three protesters were killed in oil-rich Basra, one in Hilla, and one in Samawa, security sources said.
In Diwaniya city, twelve protesters died after being trapped in a burning building, morgue officials and police sources said.
The building, which housed the local offices of the Iran-backed Badr Organisation, was apparently torched by protesters unaware that others were already inside.
Interior Ministry spokesman Khalid al-Muhanna said at least 68 members of the security forces were injured.
The sometimes violent demonstrations erupted in Baghdad on October 1 and spread to southern cities.
They pose the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi since he took office just a year ago. Despite promising reforms and ordering a broad cabinet reshuffle, he has so far struggled to address the protesters’ discontent.
POVERTY, DESPITE OIL WEALTH
Despite the OPEC member country’s vast oil wealth, many Iraqis live in poverty, have limited access to clean water, electricity, basic healthcare or decent education as the country tries to recover from years of conflict and economic hardship.
Many Iraqis view the elite as subservient to one or other of Iraq’s two main allies, the United States and Iran. Many suspect these powers use Iraq to pursue their struggle for regional influence via proxies unconcerned with ordinary people’s needs.
“They hit us last night and again this morning. We don’t have any demands anymore, we want the government toppled,” said demonstrator Salah Mohammad.
“We want Iran to take its parties and leave, America to take its parties and leave, and let the Iraqi people decide.”
In Basra, Reuters footage showed protesters clashing with security forces who launched tear gas canisters and stun grenades and were met by rocks thrown at their vehicles. Young men carried the injured away, as protesters set police cars on fire.
An 8 pm curfew was imposed until further notice in the southern provinces of Basra, Muthanna, Wasit, Babel and Dhi Qar, after protesters torched offices of lawmakers, Shi’ite political parties and militia headquarters.
How the government and security forces handled Friday’s planned protests had been seen as a litmus test for the stability of the country with political leaders already on edge.
RAGE AGAINST THE ELITE
In a Thursday night address, Abdul Mahdi stressed that violence would not be tolerated and warned that any collapse of the government would drag Iraq into further turmoil.
Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who in recent weeks criticised the government’s handling of the protests, urged calm on all sides during his sermon on Friday.
In Baghdad, many demonstrators initially believed authorities would refrain from violence after security forces killed dozens of protesters earlier this month.
Hundreds tried throughout the day to march into the city’s fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies, when they were stopped by security forces.
By afternoon, the mood had shifted with thousands of angry protesters wrapped in Iraqi flags under pouring rain, chanting that they were peaceful and calling political leaders corrupt.
As clashes broke out, tuk-tuks carried the injured to hospitals. Medical sources told Reuters hundreds of people had been treated for injuries, most related to tear gas exposure.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/indian-muslims-anxious-as-court-prepares-to-rule-on-destroyed-mosque/,"
AYODHYA: In the Indian town of Ayodhya, minority Muslims are feeling under siege as they await a Supreme Court ruling on a centuries-old religious dispute that has cast a shadow over their relations with the majority Hindu community.
After a tangle of legal cases, the Supreme Court in August decided to hear arguments every day in an effort to resolve the dispute over what should be built on the ruins of the 16th-century Babri Masjid, destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992.
The uproar over the mosque triggered some of India‘s deadliest riots, in which nearly 2,000 people, most of them Muslim, were killed.
The bloody controversy raised lingering questions about the role of religion in the officially secular country, and the place of Muslims in it.
Last month, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi finished the hearings and is expected to pronounce his verdict in the next couple of weeks.
Whichever way it goes, the decision is likely to have a significant impact on the fraught relationship between India‘s Hindus and Muslims, who constitute 14% of its 1.3 billion people.
While most Muslim religious leaders want the mosque to be rebuilt, Hindus say there is evidence there was a temple on the site before the mosque was built in 1528 by a commander of Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty.
Construction of a “grand temple” in Ayodhya has long been an election promise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won a second term with a landslide this year.
Fearing tension after the court decision, Mohammed Shahid, 48, the grandson of the mosque’s last Imam, or prayer leader, has decided to move his family away.
He has reason to be afraid.
Shahid’s father, Mohammed Shabir, was killed by a mob of Hindus who rampaged through Ayodhya before tearing down the mosque on Dec. 6, 1992.
“In 1992, we decided to stay put – a decision that we live to regret,” Shahid said, sitting in the courtyard of his run-down, two-storied house.
“Other than killing my father, they set ablaze our house and a sawmill, our only source of income.”
‘BAD ELEMENTS’
Shahid said he was glad that his grandfather, who had died in 1990, did not see the destruction of the mosque.
Unlike Shahid, Haji Mahboob Ahmad, a 66-year-old Muslim community leader who lives near the site, doesn’t plan to leave.
But he shares Shahid’s anxiety.
“We’re conscious of the fact that some bad elements can try to foment trouble by taking advantage of the situation and that’s why I’ve requested authorities to ensure the safety of Ayodhya’s Muslims,” Ahmad said.
Ahmad said India‘s founding fathers established it as a secular democracy, and it must remain that.
The day Shahid’s father was killed, Hindu Hajari Lal, 57, escaped death.
Lal was among the hundreds of Hindus who destroyed the mosque with shovels, hammers and their bare hands, bringing down its domes before the whole structure collapsed.
Unfortunately for Lal, part of the building fell on him, trapping him in the rubble with broken bones.
“Since that fateful day of 1992, the only objective of my life is to see a permanent temple on the site. I can die in peace if I get to see the temple,” Lal said.
‘ENDLESSLY WAITING’
For Hindus, Lal said, the site in Ayodhya was as sacred as Mecca is in Islam.
That’s because Lal and millions of other Hindus believe the mosque was built at the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities.
Lal helps to guide a steady stream of pilgrims who come to see a model of what they hope will become a new temple.
Visitors can also look at an open field of masonry, in pink sandstone, including piles of ornately carved columns. Concrete pillars and blocks for foundations are also ready.
“Once the court green-lights construction of the temple, we can quickly move these concrete blocks from the workshop to the temple site,” said Sharad Sharma, spokesman for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council.
Top politicians, including some cabinet ministers, regularly visit Ayodhya to pay their respect to Nritya Gopal Das, an influential monk and chairman of a trust committed to building the temple.
“I’m sure Modi ji is aware of the sentiments of millions of Hindus who have been endlessly waiting to see the Ram temple,” said Das, using an honorific for Modi.

Canada named top country for social entrepreneurs
United States suffers biggest fall amid political uncertainty
More youth interest in working for businesses that do good



LONDON: Canada was named the best country for business leaders seeking to tackle social problems in a global poll on Tuesday while the United States fell from top slot due to political uncertainty.
Australia came second in the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s second global survey on the best countries for social entrepreneurs, seeing the biggest gain of 24 places from the inaugural poll in 2016, while France came third.
Mexico came last, down 15 places from 2016, but the United States was the biggest loser, plunging to 32nd place from No. 1, with the poll of about 900 social enterprise experts pointing to difficulties with government policy and access to investment.
Francois Bonnici, head of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, said over the past three years there had been “some amazing gains and some ongoing challenges” for social entrepreneurs addressing issues from climate change to refugees.
“Governments are recognising that to meet their own agendas this is a group of citizens and entrepreneurs that actually want to improve society and the environment,” said Bonnici.
“But it has a slightly different flavour in each country and that government role is important (as it) can legitimise the sector in their country by creating these policies.”
Business entrepreneurs globally are increasingly setting their sights on social problems with ventures that can be a commercial success while addressing problems like unemployment, homelessness, mental health, knife crime and even loneliness.
For example in South Africa social enterprise Harambee has created a ‘dating service’ to match unemployed youth with employers, while in India Project Patradya is tackling the waste problem by employing Afghan refugee women to make edible bowls.
But with little data on which nations were encouraging the sector, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in partnership with Deutsche Bank, began a poll in 2016 which was repeated in 2019. Social entrepreneurs, academics, investors and support agencies in the world’s 45 biggest economies, as ranked by the World Bank, were asked their views. Iran and Saudi Arabia were dropped in 2019 as it was impossible to get the right sample.
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
The 2019 poll found most experts, 82%, said social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum in their countries – although this was down three percentage points from 2016.
Canada, Indonesia and South Africa were named as the top countries where social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum, while Mexico, the United States and China saw the biggest falls.
Despite this, more than half of respondents – 54% – said the public still did not understand what they did which was not helped by the lack of a global definition of social enterprise. Italians were most aware of their work and Poles the least.
“People are becoming aware that the whole notion of social entrepreneurship is not just kumbaya,” said former Bangladeshi-U.S. investment banker Durreen Shahnaz, founder of the first social stock exchange, Impact Investment Exchange (IIX).
“It really is about doing serious work and making sure that work is scalable … There are signs the industry is maturing.”
The rising interest of young people – under the age of 25 – was a new finding, with three in four experts saying more young people were interested in working in social enterprises.
Indonesian social entrepreneur Denica Flesch wanted a career where she had a direct impact in the fight against poverty so in 2016, aged 26, she founded SukkhaCitta, an online marketplace selling clothes made by female artisans in Indonesian villages. “Young people are really challenging the notion of work, and combining purpose and career in one place,” said Flesch.
“They’re more idealistic and want to do something that’s beyond just looking for money.”
Canada was named as the top country where young people were playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs, followed by Germany and France, as well as the top place for women leaders.
WOMEN TAKING A LEAD
“Culturally we are about diversity and inclusion at a national level. That’s our brand, so that is helpful for the environment for social enterprise,” said Marcia Nozick, founder and chief executive of Vancouver-based social enterprise EMBERS.
She said policies that encouraged governments to buy the services of social impact ventures had been vital in helping the growth of EMBERS, which finds flexible jobs for people in a deprived part of Vancouver.
Nozick said there were many female leaders because it was “about caring and relationships and that has always been at the forefront of what women have brought to the business sector”.
Women were also seen as playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs in Australia, Belgium, Sweden and Malaysia.
The United States was named the worst place for female social entrepreneurs – the same as in 2016 – while Argentina and China slumped the most in questions regarding women in the poll conducted online and by telephone between May 7 and July 30.
The biggest falls for the United States overall related to access to investment, selling to businesses and supportive government policy.
Attracting investment continued to be a challenge, according to 56% of experts, down two percentage points from 2016.
Bonnie Chiu, founder and chief executive of Lensational, a social enterprise that trains marginalised women as photographers, said there was more capital available to social entrepreneurs but they had to jump through hoops to get it.
“So much time is spent chasing these opportunities,” said Chiu, whose business is based in Britain and Hong Kong.
“Traditional businesses just need to prove that they are financially sound, traditional charities just need to prove that they are generating social impact – but social enterprises need to do both.”
But regardless of the problems getting political support, financing or selling to businesses, experts said there would always be a need for social entrepreneurs to address the world’s largest problems where markets or public policy had failed.
“The more our political leaders might struggle to solve the world’s most pressing problems, the more opportunity for social entrepreneurs to come up with solutions,” said Jude O’Reilly, a senior director at U.S. nonprofit the Skoll Foundation.

OTTAWA: Canadians began voting on Monday to determine whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept into office four years ago as a charismatic figure promising “sunny ways,” will remain in power after two major scandals.
Polls opened in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland, with voting set to end in the Pacific Coast province of British Columbia at 7 p.m. (0200 GMT on Tuesday).
Trudeau, 47, the Liberal Party leader, was endorsed by former Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama in the final stretch of the campaign and is viewed as one of the last remaining progressive leaders among the world’s major democracies.
But he was shaken during the campaign by a blackface scandal and has been dogged by criticism of his handling of a corruption case involving a major Canadian construction company. Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has also had to overcome a sense of fatigue with his government.
Trudeau, accompanied by his wife and three children, voted in Montreal on Monday after a marathon sprint campaigning across the country in the past four days.
His Liberals and the main opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer are in a neck-and-neck race, according to opinion polls.
“The truth is it’s a coin toss right now,” said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker.
A year ago, no one would have predicted that Trudeau risked being the first prime minister since the 1930s to secure a parliamentary majority and then fail to win a second term.
The latest opinion polls suggest he may narrowly avert that result and could return to office with a minority in the 338-seat House of Commons. That would still leave Trudeau in a weakened position and needing the support of left-leaning opposition parties to push through key pieces of legislation.
The Canadian dollar was trading at a new three-month high on Monday, where “domestic attention is squarely on the 43rd federal election today,” said Shaun Osborne, chief market strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
“After some noise around the vote, we think FX players will refocus attention on the Bank of Canada policy outlook, the Fed and international backdrop pretty quickly,” he said.
Despite Scheer’s dimpled smile, Trudeau’s main rival has proven to be a determined opponent.
“He can’t even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he’s always wearing a mask,” Scheer said during a debate. “Mr. Trudeau, you are a phony and you are a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country.”
In his bid to unseat Trudeau, Scheer is also promising to balance the federal budget and eliminate a “carbon tax” on fossil fuels. Scheer, 40, is running his first campaign as party leader after winning a bitter Conservative leadership fight in 2017.
BUMPY CAMPAIGN RIDE
The six-week official campaign period has been a rough and meandering ride with dirty tactics on both sides.
The liberal image of Trudeau, who has championed diversity as prime minister and whose father opened up the country to mass immigration, took a severe blow when pictures emerged early in the campaign of him wearing blackface in the early 1990s and in 2001.
Trudeau had already been wrestling with the fallout from accusations he pressured his justice minister to help shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc from corruption charges. In August, a top watchdog said Trudeau breached ethics rules.
Given the fact that neither of the front-runners could come away with a parliamentary majority, it is the smaller left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) or the separatist Bloc Quebecois that could end up holding the balance of power.
“I am a lifelong Liberal voter and I am stumped on this one, mostly because I am really concerned about a Conservative win and just trying to figure out how to vote strategically,” said Kristin Street, 33, a strategy manager at a computer games company, in Port Moody, British Columbia.
EKOS Research pollster Frank Graves said Liberals needed turnout to be similar to four years ago or otherwise the Conservatives may have an edge.
“We may well be waiting until the final vote tallies in British Columbia to see who will win on Monday,” Graves said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/indonesia-says-over-11500-have-fled-violence-hit-papuan-town/,"
JAKARTA: Indonesian authorities said on Thursday more than 11,500 people have been evacuated from the town of Wamena in the easternmost province of Papua since dozens died during clashes last month in the area.
Located on the western half of the island of New Guinea and long racked by a simmering separatist insurgency, Papua encompasses Indonesia’s two easternmost provinces and has a distinct ethnic Melanesian population.
There has been a spike in protests and unrest since late August after Papuan students in Surabaya, Indonesia’s second city on the island of Java, were taunted and attacked by a mob chanting racial epithets over accusations they had desecrated a national flag.
In some of the worst bloodshed in decades in Papua, 33 people died and scores were hurt during clashes in Wamena on Sept. 23.
Government offices and homes were burned down, and 250 cars and motorcycles destroyed, as indigenous Papuans and security forces clashed.
The government and some Papuan independence activists say 25 of the 33 who died there were migrants from elsewhere in the country.
Erizal, 42, a former resident of Wamena who had left, said his child and wife died during the unrest and he now felt too traumatised to consider returning to the town.
“I am in my village in Padang now, maybe I will not return back to Wamena,” he said by telephone from the Padang area on Sumatra island where he was originally from.
He said his shop had also been burnt down in the unrest.
Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 2 Indonesia‘s air force had flown 7,467 people out of Wamena on Hercules planes, while 4,179 people had left on commercial flights, said Harry Hikmat, an official at Indonesia‘s social ministry.
Ahmad Musthofa Kamal, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said the situation in Wamane was now stable and that shops and markets were open again.
A former Dutch colony, Papua was formally incorporated into Indonesia in 1969, after a disputed vote of about 1,025 hand-picked tribal leaders. The result of the plebiscite was overseen and endorsed by the United Nations.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has opened the door to holding talks with separatists in Papua, a departure from the stance of previous governments and some of his cabinet ministers.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/hong-kong-police-fire-rubber-bullets-tear-gas-as-clashes-intensify/,"
HONG KONG: Hong Kong police fired water cannon, rubber bullets and round after round of tear gas at petrol-bomb and brick-throwing protesters on Sunday in some of the most widespread violence in more than three months of anti-government unrest.
Running battles in the Causeway Bay shopping district, Wan Chai bar area and the Admiralty district of central government offices followed a night of showdowns with police in the Chinese-ruled city after a peaceful pro-democracy rally turned ugly on the streets outside.
More protests are planned in the run-up to China’s Oct. 1 National Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.
Police also fired tear gas from the roof of the Legislative Council building, which activists trashed and daubed with graffiti weeks ago.
Protesters, many of them wearing their trademark black with face masks, took cover from the tear gas behind umbrellas and held their ground on Sunday, some throwing tear gas canisters back at police as a helicopter flew overhead.
They built barricades with trolleys and trash cans and other debris. One threw a petrol bomb at police in the Wan Chai metro station.
At least one petrol bomb landed in the grounds of central government offices where several windows were smashed.
Police, who traditionally raise placards warning of retaliation before firing tear gas or firing water cannon, made several arrests, grappling people to the tarmac. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.
The water cannon fired blue dye, which elsewhere in the world is used to make identification of offenders easier.
The government said that the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, will be out of town for China’s National Day, despite her having sent out invitations for celebrations at home.
Some shops closed ahead of expected demonstrations, while the MTR metro service shut stations, a move that has made it a target of violence in the past.
Protesters shouted anti-China slogans and called for their “five demands, not one less” of the government, including universal suffrage and the dropping of all charges against their arrested colleagues.
About 200 China supporters dressed in red T-shirts gathered on top of Victoria Peak, overlooking the harbour, at around midday. They sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted “I love China”.
Angela, a housewife in her 40s, a Chinese flag sticker plastered on her cheek, said the pro-democracy protesters were “thugs”.
“If the government takes violent action I don’t object,” she said. “We have tolerated enough. I think I have emotional problems because of the riots. Because it’s not safe to go out.”
CHANGE OF HEART
Lam, the focus of weeks of anti-government unrest, will leave for Beijing on Monday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic the following day.
Lam, who was trapped in an indoor stadium by street protests for hours this week after an “open dialogue” with the people, will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night overland, minimising the chances of a clash at the airport, a popular target of anti-government protests.
She had sent out invitations “requesting the pleasure of your company” at a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Tuesday.
It was not immediately clear why she had the change of heart but the government said Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung would stand in for her.
Arthur, 40, wearing glasses and a mask covering the lower half of his face, said Lam’s trip was expected.
“In these three months, Carrie Lam has not really cared about the protesters. She only cares about the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) or what we might call ‘her boss’,” he said. “I think Hong Kong is somehow at this moment the frontline between Western democracy and the dictatorship in China…. Hong Kong looks more and more like a police state.”
Police fired tear gas and water cannon on Saturday night to disperse protesters who threw petrol bombs and rocks, broke government office windows and blocked a key road near the local headquarters of China’s People’s Liberation Army.
Anti-government protesters have attacked the legislature, Beijing’s main Liaison Office, occupied the airport, thrown petrol bombs at police, vandalised metro stations and set street fires in the former British colony.
Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.
The protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.
China dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.
Protests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement. Rallies in support of the anti-government protesters were held in Australia’s largest cities, with the biggest in Sydney.
Many wore face masks to hide their identity and crowds yelled “stand with Hong Kong” and “fight for freedom”, while placards depicted Chinese President Xi Jinping with a cross marked across his face.

NEW YORK: Earth is in more hot water than ever before, and so are we, an expert United Nations climate panel warned in a grim new report Wednesday.
Sea levels are rising at an ever-faster rate as ice and snow shrink, and oceans are getting more acidic and losing oxygen, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report issued as world leaders met at the United Nations.
The agency warned that if steps aren’t taken to reduce emissions and slow global warming, seas will rise 3 feet by the end of the century, with many fewer fish, less snow and ice, stronger and wetter hurricanes and other, nastier weather systems.
“The oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble, and that means we’re all in big trouble, too,” said one of the report’s lead authors, Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “The changes are accelerating.”
The dire effects will be felt on both land and sea, harming people, plants, animals, food, societies, infrastructure and the global economy. In fact, the international team of scientists projected for the first time that some island nations will probably become uninhabitable.
The oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat from carbon pollution in the air, as well as much of the carbon dioxide itself. Earth’s snow and ice, called the cryosphere, are also being eroded.
“The world’s oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe,” said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a deputy assistant administrator for research at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The report found:
Seas are now rising at one-seventh of an inch (3.66 millimeters) a year, which is 2.5 times faster than the rate from 1900 to 1990.
The world’s oceans have already lost 1% to 3% of the oxygen in their upper levels since 1970 and will lose more as warming continues.
From 2006 to 2015, the ice melting from Greenland, Antarctica and the world’s mountain glaciers has accelerated. They are now losing 720 billion tons (653 billion metric tons) of ice a year.
Arctic June snow cover has shrunk more than half since 1967, down nearly 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).
Arctic sea ice in September, the annual low point, is down almost 13% per decade since 1979. This year’s low, reported Monday, tied for the second-lowest on record.
Marine animals are likely to decrease 15%, and catches by fisheries in general are expected to decline 21% to 24%, by the end of century because of climate change.
“Climate change is already irreversible,” French climate scientist Valérie Masson-Delmotte, a report lead author, said at a news conference in Monaco, where the document was released. “Due to the heat uptake in the ocean, we can’t go back.”
But many of the worst-case projections in the report can still be avoided, depending on how the world handles the emissions of heat-trapping gases, the report’s authors said.
The IPCC increased its projected end-of-century sea level rise in the worst-case scenario by nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) from its 2013 projections because of the increased recent melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.
The new report projects that, under the business-as-usual scenario for carbon emissions, seas by the end of the century will rise between 2 feet (61 centimeters) and 43 inches (110 centimeters), with a most likely rise of 33 inches (84 centimeters). This is slightly less than the traditional 1 meter (39 inches) that scientists often use.
And sea level will rise two to three times as much over the centuries to come if warming continues, so the world is looking at a “future that certainly looks completely different than what we currently have,” said report co-author Hans-Otto Portner, a German climate scientist.
The Nobel Prize-winning IPCC requires that its reports be unanimously approved. Because of that, its reports tend to show less sea level rise and smaller harm than other scientific studies, outside experts said.
“Like many of the past reports, this one is conservative in the projections, especially in how much ice can be lost in Greenland and Antarctica,” said NASA oceanographer Josh Willis, who studies Greenland ice melt and wasn’t part of the report.
Willis said people should be prepared for a rise in sea levels to be twice these IPCC projections.
The world’s warm water coral reefs will go extinct in some places and be dramatically different in others, the report said.
“We are already seeing the demise of the warm water coral reefs,” Portner said. “That is one of the strongest warning signals that we have available.”
Outside scientists praised the work but were disturbed by it.
“It is alarming to read such a thorough cataloging of all of the serious changes in the planet that we’re driving,” said Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler. “What’s particularly disturbing as a scientist is that virtually all of these changes were predicted years or decades ago.”
The report’s authors emphasized that it doesn’t doom Earth to this gloomy future.
“We indicate we have a choice. Whether we go into a grim future depends on the decisions that are being made,” Portner said.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump welcomed Australia’s prime minister on Friday for only the second state visit of his administration, signaling the close bond between the two allies as Washington takes on Beijing and Tehran.
Trump and Scott Morrison are expected to discuss security and trade, as China’s increasing assertiveness, especially in the energy-rich South China Sea, has raised concerns within the region and the United States.
The leaders are also set to release a plan on Friday aimed at securing the supply of rare earth minerals, as concerns grow that China, the world’s largest processor and producer of the minerals, could cut off shipments of the prized commodities.
Days before the visit, a sign draped across the Australian Embassy in Washington proclaimed “100 years of mateship” between the two countries. On Friday, Trump feted Morrison’s arrival at the White House’s South Lawn with a 19-gun salute and US Marine Band performances of each nation’s national anthems.
“It’s highly symbolic of where the relationship sits at the moment,” said Patrick Buchan, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting that Morrison’s state visit was second only to French President Emmanuel Macron’s last year.
“Australia played a very smart game with Trump,” he added, noting the country had avoiding directly criticizing him, unlike some European counterparts.
Trump got off to a smooth start with Morrison in May, congratulating him on his surprise election victory in a tweet noting there were “no greater friends” than the United States and Australia.
The two also met on the sidelines of the G20 in June, cementing warm ties that Trump did not enjoy with Morrison’s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. Trump berated Turnbull in February 2017 over a bilateral refugee agreement before abruptly ending their telephone conversation.
Australia also agreed last month to join a coalition to protect oil tankers and cargo ships from threats posed by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz after a series of attacks there that Washington has blamed on Tehran.
Australia has also banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , the world’s top provider of telecoms equipment, from its 5G network, something the Trump administration has struggled to persuade other allies to do. The United States says Huawei’s ties to Beijing make the network equipment it sells to telecoms firms a security risk.
Australian intelligence concluded China was responsible for a cyberattack on Australia’s parliament and its three largest political parties, Reuters reported on Monday.
Following an arrival ceremony, bilateral meetings, and a joint news conference, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will host a luncheon for Morrison to be followed by a state dinner at the White House.
SECURITY AND TRADE
During a visit to Sydney last month by Pompeo and US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the United States and Australia pledged to strengthen opposition to Chinese activities in the Pacific.
China has unnerved the region and angered the United States by installing military equipment and other facilities on artificial islands it has made in the disputed South China Sea.
The United States and its Western allies also worry that China is using foreign aid to secure greater influence over small Pacific countries that control vast swath of resource-rich ocean.
Australia, traditionally the major power in the South Pacific, has promised up to A$3 billion ($2 billion) in grants and loans to counter what Washington describes as China’s “payday loan diplomacy.”
But Morrison has pressed Trump to end his trade war with China, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.

BEIJING: China expressed anger on Tuesday after German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas met prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, saying that no foreign country had a right to interfere in China’s internal affairs.
Wong met Maas on Monday in Berlin at an event hosted by the German newspaper BILD.
After being held for around 24 hours at the Hong Kong airport on Sunday for allegedly breaching the terms of his bail, Wong arrived in Berlin late on Monday evening, where he said he would “continue his battle for free elections”.
The timing is especially awkward as German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Beijing last week. Hong Kong has been gripped by weeks of protests, initially against a now-shelved extradition bill and now focused more on securing greater freedoms for Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China was “extremely dissatisfied and resolutely opposed” to German allowing Wong to visit and to allow him to meet the German foreign minister.
“China has already lodged stern representations with the German side,” Hua told a daily news briefing.
Hong Kong is an internal affair and no foreign government, organisation or individual has a right to interfere, she added.
“Any plots to rely on foreigners to build oneself up or acts or words to split the country are doomed to failure.”
Hua said that during her trip last week, Merkel clearly said that she opposes violence and supports “one country, two systems”.
Hong Kong returned to Beijing from British rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
“We can’t help but ask, what is the purpose of the German side in allowing Joshua Wong to come to Germany at this time and to meet with minister Maas?”
China urges Germany to abide by its promises and avoid sending wrong messages to separatist Hong Kong forces, and urges Maas to abide by the basics of international law and act for the benefit of relations and not be a “damager” of the relationship, Hua added.
Interference by foreign parliaments in Hong Kong‘s matters is deeply regrettable, the leader of the Chinese-ruled city said earlier on Tuesday, adding that an escalation of violence cannot solve social issues in the city.
Carrie Lam was speaking after another weekend of sometimes violent clashes in the former British colony, with police firing tear gas to disperse protesters in cat-and-mouse skirmishes, at times smashing windows and starting street fires.
Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding the autonomy they had been promised. China denies accusations of meddling in the city.

SRINAGAR: India on Sunday imposed curfews in several parts of the contested Kashmir region, after clashes between security forces and Shi’ite Muslims taking part in a procession, officials and eyewitnesses said.
At least 12 locals and six troops were injured on Saturday evening, officials told Reuters, as the worshippers on the traditional mourning procession of Muharram clashed with troops trying to stop it.
Troops used tear gas and pellet guns on the crowd, which insisted on carrying on with the procession, one in a series held at this time of the year, and pelted stones at security forces, an Indian official who declined to named told Reuters.
“The clashes continued till late night during which the troops fired tear gas and pellets,” he added.
A spokeswoman for India‘s interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
“Reasonable restrictions are necessary for peace and protection of life,” India‘s national security adviser had said on Saturday, accusing Islamabad of trying to stoke violence in the region.
Kashmir, a mountainous Muslim-majority region claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been the site of frequent altercations between security forces and locals protesting against New Delhi’s decision to revoke special rights for the portion of the territory that it controls on Aug. 5.
The most recent clashes occurred in Rainawari and Badgam, two Shi’ite majority areas of Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir’s main city.
The five km (3 mile) procession route that passes through the city centre has been barricaded by armed troops wearing helmets and bullet proof vests.
On Sunday, police vans fitted with loud speakers announced curfew-like restrictions in Srinagar’s city center Lal Chowk and adjacent areas, according to two Reuters witnesses.
“People are advised to stay indoors and not venture out of their home,” the police announced.
Suhail Ahmed, a Rainawari resident, said that there have been frequent clashes in the area for last three to four days as troops have been trying to block the procession.
“We hear deafening sounds of tear gas being fired for last few evenings. We mostly stay indoors but the gas comes into our homes making it difficult to sleep,” Ahmed said.
Muharram is the first month of the year according to the Muslim lunar calendar, and traditionally processions are held for the first 10 days of the month to observe the death of Prophet Muhammad’s nephew Imam Hussein, killed in battle in 680.
Shi’ite Muslims typically intensify their expression of suffering on the Ashura day, that this year falls on Tuesday.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests so the Chinese-ruled city can move forward from a “highly vulnerable and dangerous” place and find solutions.
Her televised announcement came after Reuters reports on Friday and Monday revealing that Beijing had thwarted an earlier proposal from Lam to withdraw the bill and that she had said privately that she would resign if she could, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters.
“Lingering violence is damaging the very foundations of our society, especially the rule of law,” a sombre Lam said as she sat wearing a navy blue jacket and pink shirt with her hands folded on a desk in front of her.
The withdrawal, a key demand of protesters but just one of five, came after unrest that drove the former British colony to the edge of anarchy as the government repeatedly refused to back down – igniting pitched battles across the city of seven million, the arrests of more than 1,000 protesters, and leaving a society deeply divided.
Many are furious about perceived police brutality and the number of arrests – 1,183 at the latest count – and want an independent inquiry.
“The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,” Lam said.
“I pledge that the government will seriously follow up the recommendations of the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Council) report. From this month, I and my principal officials will reach out to the community to start a direct dialogue … we must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions.”
The protests began in March but snowballed in June and have since evolved into a push for greater democracy for the city which returned to China in 1997.
The bill would have allowed extraditions to mainland China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
It was not immediately clear if killing the bill would help end the unrest. The immediate reaction appeared sceptical and the real test will be how many people take to the streets.
Some lawmakers said the move should have come earlier.
“The damage has been done. The scars and wounds are still bleeding,” said pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo. “She thinks she can use a garden hose to put out a hill fire. That’s not going to be acceptable.”
WINNING OVER MODERATES?
In the voice recording obtained by Reuters, Lam said at a meeting last week that her room to find a political solution to the crisis was “very limited”, as authorities in Beijing now viewed the situation as a matter of national security.
Beijing’s apparent endorsement of the withdrawal of the bill comes after the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rule since he took power in 2012.
Others said the move was not enough.
“This won’t appease the protesters,” said Boris Chen, 37, who works in financial services. “In any kind of time, people will find something they can get angry about.”
Pro-Beijing lawmaker Cheung Kwok-kwan said Lam’s announcement was not a compromise to appease those promoting violence, but a bid to win over moderates in the protest camp.
“It was likely speaking to the so-called peaceful, rational, non-violent people who were unsatisfied with the government’s response before,” he said.
One woman, Pearl, 69, said the protests were no longer about the bill.
“Some of those guys may change their minds, maybe, but just a minority,” she said of the protesters. “Some of them just want to create trouble and they will continue to do so.”
“Too little, too late,” said Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014 pro-democracy protests which were the precursor to the current unrest, on his Facebook page.
Leung Yiu-ting, president of the Hong Kong Education University student union, said the timing was wrong.
“Until the five demands are met, I don’t think the protests and the social movement will stop,” he said.
The protesters’ other four demands are: the retraction of the word “riot” to describe rallies, the release of all arrested demonstrators, an independent inquiry into the police perceived brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to democratically choose their own leaders.
The chief executive’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill’s withdrawal.
Hong Kong‘s benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped after the report of the bill’s imminent withdrawal, trading up about 4%. The property index also jumped.
Lam had said before that the bill was “dead”, but she did not withdraw it.
CHINA’S WARNINGS
Hong Kong returned to China under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system, hence the anger at the extradition bill and perceived creeping influence by Beijing.
China denies it is meddling in Hong Kong‘s affairs but warned again on Tuesday that it would not sit idly by if the unrest threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.
China has regularly denounced the protests and warned about the impact on Hong Kong‘s economy.
Cathay Pacific Airways has been one of the biggest corporate casualties.
China’s aviation regulator demanded it suspend staff from flying over its airspace if they were involved in, or supported, the demonstrations. The airline has laid off at least 20 including pilots and cabin crew.
The airline on Wednesday announced the resignation of chairman John Slosar, following the departure of CEO Rupert Hogg last month.
The unrest has shown no sign of easing.
Riot police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray – both anti-riot weapons – to clear demonstrators from outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station, with one man taken out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, television footage showed.
The police, who have repeatedly denied using excessive force, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HONG KONG: Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw global attention to their fight for greater democracy for the Chinese-ruled city which is facing its biggest political crisis in decades.
Planes were taking off and landing, with delays, but trains were suspended and approach roads to the airport impassable as protesters erected barricades and overturned trolleys at the airport and in the nearby new town of Tung Chung.
Some passengers were forced to walk the last bit of their journey to the airport by foot, dragging their luggage behind them.
The MTR subway station in Tung Chung was closed and demonstrators smashed CCTV cameras and lamps with metal poles and dismantled station turnstiles. Police appeared to be running in all directions and made several arrests.
Chek Lap Kok, built around a tiny outlying island in the dying days of British colonial rule, is one of the world’s busiest and most efficient airports, reached by a series of bridges which were packed with traffic.
“If we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong,” said one 20-year-old protester, asking not to be named.
Black-clad demonstrators targeted the airport three weeks ago, jamming the terminal in sometimes violent clashes with police and prompting some flights to be cancelled or delayed.
Police said protesters hurled iron poles, bricks and rocks on to the railway track near the airport station and trespassed on the track. By early evening protesters in the immediate vicinity of the airport had left, but protesters in Tung Chung remained.
“We have no idea how to leave. We’re stuck,” a masked protester said, as others looked for buses and ferries to get back home.
Sunday’s demonstration comes after police and protesters clashed overnight in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to the territory when it was handed back to China in 1997.
China denies the charge of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.
Tourist numbers have plummeted in recent weeks and international trade fairs cancelled as the territory faces its first recession in a decade.
China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.
Several hundred demonstrators also gathered outside the British consulate in central Hong Kong, waving Union Jack flags and chanting “God save the Queen”.
SUBWAY VIOLENCE
Parts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway on Saturday, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas. Police said they arrested 63 people aged between 13 and 36.
Amnesty International said the metro violence should be investigated.
“Violence directed at police on Saturday is no excuse for officers to go on the rampage elsewhere,” it said.
The latest protests came on the fifth anniversary of China’s decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong.
The unrest began in mid-June, fuelled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.
But the turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy.
The unrest poses the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.
Protesters have called for a general strike on Monday, but it was not immediately clear who would take part.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of efforts to restore calm and that talks with non-violent protesters would provide “a way out” for the Chinese-ruled city.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied peacefully in torrential rain on Sunday in the eleventh week of what have been often violent demonstrations.
“I sincerely hope that this was the beginning of society returning to peace and staying away from violence,” Lam said.
“We will immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue. This dialogue, I hope, will be based on a mutual understanding and respect and find a way out for today’s Hong Kong.”
Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China for trial.
The unrest has been fuelled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place after Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.
Three people were wounded, one critically, in a knife attack by an unknown assailant near a “Lennon Wall” of colourful pro-protest messages in the city’s Tseung Kwan O district in the New Territories overnight, police said. One man was arrested.
The protests have prompted sharp reactions from Beijing, which has accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest in the territory. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighbouring Shenzhen.
Britain’s Foreign Office said it was extremely concerned about reports that a Hong Kong staff member had been detained in mainland China, but there was no immediate suggestion that there was any link to the protests.
Staff member Simon Cheng did not return to work on Aug. 9 after visiting the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen the previous day, Hong Kong news website HK01 reported. China’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment. Hong Kong police did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc also said on Monday they had dismantled a state-backed social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on the Twitter and Facebook actions, but defended the right of Chinese people to make their voices heard.
Further demonstrations are planned in the next few days, including by MTR subway workers on Wednesday, secondary school students on Thursday and accountants on Friday.
The protests are exacting a toll on the city’s economy and tourism, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.
Singapore universities have cancelled exchange programmes to Hong Kong after Singapore warned its citizens to defer travel there, news website Today reported.
Singapore’s foreign ministry said in an advisory last week large protests in Hong Kong had become unpredictable and could turn violent with little or no notice.
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS
Sunday’s protest turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and protesters could be seen on Sunday night urging others to go home peacefully.
Aside from seeking Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
“The bill is dead,” Lam told Tuesday’s news briefing. “There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns.”
Police have been criticised for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
Lam said the police watchdog had set up a task force to investigate complaints.
She said she hoped Hong Kong had “unique advantages in attracting overseas companies”, stressing the rule of law, but warned of the risk of pressure on the economy which shrank 0.4% in April-June from the previous quarter.
“The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half. Actually, I think the data in the first half has not fully reflected the seriousness of the problem,” she said.
China has put strong pressure on big companies in Hong Kong over the protests, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s departure was announced by Chinese state television and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in protests.
China’s State Council called on Monday for greater development of the southern city of Shenzhen and integration of its culture and economy with neighbouring Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong is gearing up for further protests this week after hundreds of thousands of anti-government demonstrators braved heavy rain to rally peacefully on Sunday, marking a change to what have often been violent clashes.
Sunday’s massive turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the Chinese-ruled city’s airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and on Sunday night protesters could be seen urging others to go home peacefully.
Police said on Monday that while Sunday’s demonstration was mostly peaceful, there were breaches of the peace in the evening when some protesters defaced public buildings and aimed laser beams at officers.
It was a far cry from the violent clashes between protesters and riot police throughout the summer, with activists storming the legislature and targeting China’s main Liaison Office in the city. The weekend was also noteworthy for a lack of tear gas use by police.
The protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. They have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China, including an independent judiciary, but many in the city believe Beijing has been eroding those freedoms.
Aside from Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
One protester, speaking at a “citizen’s press conference” on Monday, was asked what path the protests would take now, peaceful or violent.
“We have started our rallies very peacefully but after two and a half months it seems that the Hong Kong government has not responded to our five demands so one thing leads to another and it may cause escalation,” the speaker, named Wang, said.
“If you ask me, I personally hope there will be a quick resolution to this from the government so we don’t have to protest any more.”
On Sunday, protesters spilling out from Victoria Park, the designated rally area on Hong Kong island, streamed onto major thoroughfares towards the city’s financial centre, chanting for Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam to step down.
Police estimated the size of the crowd in Victoria Park at 128,000 at its peak, although that excludes the masses of umbrella-carrying demonstrators who packed the streets.
CHINESE FORCES ACROSS THE BORDER
The Hong Kong government said in a statement on Sunday night it was important to restore social order as soon as possible and that it would begin talks with the public and “rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down”.
The Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, attributed the change in the character of Sunday’s protest to the presence of Chinese paramilitary forces, which have been conducting exercises in Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong.
“This was widely seen as a stern warning to the violent elements in Hong Kong,” it said, adding that a backlash from Hong Kong residents over last week’s airport occupations was another factor.
The Chinese Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper warned again in an editorial on Monday that hostile foreign influences were inciting the protest movement. Beijing has accused some countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest.
US President Donald Trump hinted on Sunday that the White House would like to see Beijing resolve the protests before the world’s two largest economies could reach a trade deal.
“I would like to see Hong Kong worked out in a very humanitarian fashion,” Trump said. “I think it would be very good for the trade deal.”
Further demonstrations are planned in coming weeks, including protests planned by Christians and even an accountants’ group.
Police have come under criticism for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations, but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
The central government has sought to deepen integration between the mainland and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and nearby Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave which returned to China in 1999. The State Council called on Monday for greater development of the so-called Greater Bay Area and to enrich the “one country, two systems” policy.
China has also put strong pressure on big companies, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s sudden departure was announced by Chinese state television on Friday and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in the protests.
Shares in Cathay rose more than 2% early on Monday before paring gains to be down 0.6%. Jeffries analysts wrote in a note on Monday that it maintained its “buy” rating on Cathay and that it expected the company to remain profitable.

KATHMANDU: Nepal must make training and experience in high altitude climbing mandatory for all climbers on Mount Everest and other high peaks, a government panel said on Wednesday, following the deadliest climbing season in four years.
Eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the 8,850 metre (29,035 feet) mountain in May – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side.
The Nepali panel – made up of government officials, climbing experts and agencies representing the climbing community – was set up after climbers and guides criticised officials after the deaths for allowing anyone who paid $11,000 to climb Everest.
Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Everest, and mountain climbing is a key source of employment and income for the cash strapped nation.
But the numbers attempting the climb in May led to crowding in the so-called death zone, where there are very low oxygen levels. That put lives at risk as oxygen cylinders ran out while up to 100 people waited in the queue.
Nepal issued 381 permits for Everest for this year’s climbing season, which tends to culimate in May, when the daylight and weather is the most forgiving.
“Climbers to Sagarmatha and other 8,000 metre mountains must undergo basic and high altitude climbing training,” the panel said in a report submitted to the government, referring to the Nepali name of Mount Everest.
The report said those hoping to climb Everest must climb at least one Nepali peak above 6,500 metres before getting a permit. Climbers must also submit a certificate of good health and physical fitness, and be accompanied by a trained Nepali guide, it said.
Ghanshyam Upadhyaya, a senior Tourism Ministry official, said the recommendations would be implemented.
“The government will now make the required changes in laws and regulations guiding mountain climbing,” he told Reuters.
Mira Acharya, a member of the panel said “climbers died due to altitude sickness, heart attack, exhaustion or weaknesses and not due to traffic jams”.
She said the compulsory provision of guides for each climber was to discourage solo attempts which put lives at risk.
A reliable weather forecasting system should be in place and rope fixing should be done in time, giving enough space for the climbers to use a window of good weather to reach the summit, the report said.

HONG KONG: Flights leaving Hong Kong were disrupted for a second day on Tuesday, plunging the former British colony deeper into turmoil as its stockmarket fell to a seven-month low, and its leader said it had been pushed into a state of “panic and chaos”.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also urged Hong Kong to exercise restraint and investigate evidence of its forces firing tear gas at protesters in ways banned under international law.
Ten weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and protesters have roiled the Asian financial hub as thousands of residents chafe at a perceived erosion of freedoms and autonomy under Chinese rule.
China this week condemned some protesters for using dangerous tools to attack police, calling the clashes “sprouts of terrorism”. They present President Xi Jinping with one of his biggest challenges since he came to power in 2012.
Hong Kong legal experts say Beijing might be paving the way to use anti-terror laws to try to quell the demonstrations.
Check-in operations were suspended at 4.30 pm on Tuesday, a day after an unprecedented airport shutdown, as thousands of black-clad protesters jammed the terminal, chanting, singing and waving banners.
“Take a minute to look at our city, our home,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said, her voice cracking, at a news conference in the government headquarters complex, which is fortified behind 6-foot (1.8-m) -high water-filled barricades.
“Can we bear to push it into the abyss and see it smashed to pieces?”
The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed suspects’ extradition to mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy.
At the airport, thousands of protesters gathered in the arrivals hall, as well as some parts of departures, using luggage trolleys to blockade the doors to customs checkpoints.
Floors and walls were covered with missives penned by activists and other artwork. The scene was peaceful as knots of protesters spoke to travellers, explaining their aims.
“Sorry for the inconvenience, we are fighting for the future of our home,” read one protest banner at the airport.
“I think paralysing the airport will be effective in forcing Carrie Lam to respond to us … it can further pressure Hong Kong’s economy,” said Dorothy Cheng, 17.
Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997.
They want Lam to resign. She says she will stay.
“My responsibility goes beyond this particular range of protest,” she said, adding that violence had pushed the territory into a state of “panic and chaos”.
As she spoke, the benchmark Hang Seng index hit a seven-month low. It shed more than 2%, dragging down markets across Asia.
Lam did not respond to questions at a press briefing to clarify if she had the power to withdraw the extradition bill and satisfy a key demand made by the protesters, or if she needed Beijing’s approval.
AIRPORT DISRUPTED
Airport authorities had earlier suspended check-in operations as the fifth day of a sit-in by protesters grew increasingly heated. Crowds continued to swell in the evening.
“Terminal operations at Hong Kong International Airport have been seriously disrupted as a result of the public assembly,” the airport authority said.
Some passengers challenged protesters over the delays as tempers began to fray, while the demonstrators, using a Chinese term of encouragement, chanted, “Hong Kong people – add oil!”
Flag carrier Cathay Pacific warned: “There is potential for further flight disruptions at short notice.”
The airline, whose British heritage makes it a symbol of Hong Kong’s colonial past, is also in a political bind.
China’s civil aviation regulator demanded that the airline suspend staff who joined or backed the protests from flights in its airspace, pushing the carrier’s shares past Monday’s 10-year low.
Other Chinese airlines have offered passengers wanting to avoid Hong Kong a free switch to nearby destinations, such as Guangzhou, Macau, Shenzhen or Zhuhai, with the disruption sending shares in Shenzhen Airport Co Ltd surging.
On Monday China said the protests had reached a critical juncture, after a weekend of street clashes in which both police and protesters appeared to toughen their resolve.
Police fired tear gas at the blackshirted crowds in districts on Hong Kong island, Kowloon and the New Territories.

HONG KONG/BEIJING: China’s aviation regulator on Friday demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend personnel who have engaged in illegal protests in the city from staffing flights into its airspace from August 10.
Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Last week, a Cathay pilot was among over 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.
On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said that Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website.
The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights.
Crew members that have not gained the authority’s approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations.
The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.
In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: “We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly.”
“The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific. There is zero tolerance for any inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour that may affect aviation safety. We deal with these incidents very seriously.”
Cathay said on Thursday it respects “everyone’s right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner,” while insisting it “recognises that Hong Kong SAR is a part of China”.
“We do not condone any activities that jeopardise the stability of Hong Kong,” it said.
On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights.
Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respects its staff’s opinions.
“We certainly wouldn’t dream of telling them what they have to think about something. They’re all adults, they’re all service professionals. We respect them greatly,” he said.
Global Times, published by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, ran news stories this week highlighting Cathay employees’ participation in the ongoing protests.
Embattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam on Friday urged an end to the violence, claiming that the protests are dragging on the city’s economy.
Hong Kong-listed Cathay is 45% owned by Swire Pacific and 22.7% held by Air China , according to Refinitiv Eikon.
The airline has been Hong Kong’s flag carrier since the colonial era. Swire Pacific’s parent, John Swire & Sons Ltd, is a UK-based conglomerate with businesses ranging from property to transportation.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Wednesday it would expel India’s ambassador and suspend bilateral trade with its arch-rival after New Delhi stripped its portion of the contested Kashmir region of special status.
Neighbours China and Pakistan, which both claim parts of the region, have voiced fierce opposition to India’s move dropping a constitutional provision that had allowed the country’s only Muslim-majority state to make its own laws.
Moin-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s newly-appointed ambassador to India, had yet to take up his post but will now not move to New Delhi, while Indian Ambassador Ajay Bisaria will be expelled, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a telephone interview with Pakistani TV channel ARY News.
“It is very obvious that our ambassador wouldn’t be in Delhi, and obviously the man who is here will also leave,” Qureshi said.
Earlier Pakistan’s National Security Committee, a panel of top government and military officials chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, said it would implement a range of measures over what it called India’s “illegal” decision to revoke Kashmir’s special status.
That includes “downgrading of diplomatic relations with India” and a further review of bilateral arrangements between the two countries, a committee statement said, without elaborating further.
Qureshi told Pakistan’s parliament on Wednesday the country was consulting with China regarding Kashmir and that he might fly to Beijing for discussions with officials there.
A spokesman for India’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ISLAMABAD/MUZAFFARABAD: Pakistan said on Tuesday it was considering further diplomatic and military pressure on India after the Hindu-majority nation stripped its portion of contested Kashmir of special status.
India on Monday dropped a constitutional provision for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which has long been a flashpoint in ties with neighbouring Pakistan, to make its own laws.
Nuclear arch-rivals India and Pakistan both claim Muslim-majority Kashmir in full but rule it in part. They have fought two wars over the territory and came close to a third this year after a car bomb set off by a Pakistan-based militant group killed dozens of Indian paramilitary police.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday India’s removal of special status for Kashmir, which included prohibiting outsiders from owning property, was an attempt to alter the demographics of the region and was illegal under international law.
“We will fight it at every forum. We’re thinking how we can take it to International Court (of Justice)… to the United Nations Security Council,” Khan said in an address to Pakistan’s parliament.
Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, accusing India of violating Security Council resolutions on Kashmir.
Qureshi is returning early from the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as a result of the crisis, the foreign ministry said.
India maintains its actions in Kashmir are legal both under domestic and international law.
Earlier on Tuesday, Pakistan’s army chief said the country’s military will “go to any extent” to support people in the region.
“Pakistan Army firmly stands by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end,” said General Qamar Javed Bajwa after meeting with top commanders in Rawalpindi.
“We are prepared and shall go to any extent to fulfil our obligations in this regard,” he added, without elaborating further.
BUSINESS SHUTDOWN
In Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir around 45km (28 miles) from the contested border between the neighbours, protests continued for a second day with hundreds of people including children shouting anti-India slogans.
In the Neelum Valley, which sits on the border and has seen heavy shelling between the two countries in recent weeks, there was a shutdown of shops and businesses in protest at India’s decision.
Many people in Kashmir have relatives on both sides of the border, but people on the Pakistani side say they have been unable to contact those in India for several days after New Delhi restricted internet and phone access.
Tanveer-ul-Islam migrated from India to Muzaffarabad in 1990. His family, including his elderly mother and siblings, live in the Badgam district of Indian Kashmir, but he said he has been unable to contact them for two days.
“My day does not begin until I speak to my mother, but I have not been able to talk to her (since) Aug 4. You can’t even imagine my pain,” he said. “We do not know about the well being of anyone across the divide”.
His wife Haleema Akhtar, whose family is in Magam in Indian-administered Kashmir, said she was also unable to contact them.
“I called my daughter and son-in-law in the US to try to contact them, but they too expressed helplessness in the face of the clampdown on communication,” she said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/british-scientist-makes-breakthrough-in-race-for-coronavirus-vaccine-sky/,"LONDON: A leading British scientist has made a significant breakthrough in the race for a coronavirus vaccine by reducing a part of the normal development time from “two to three years to just 14 days”, Sky news reported.

Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, said he is now at the stage to start testing the vaccine on animals as early as next week with human studies in the summer if enough funding is secured, Sky said.
“Conventional approaches usually take at least two to three years before you even get to the clinic,” he told Sky. “And we’ve gone from that sequence to generating a candidate in the laboratory in 14 days.”
The vaccine will be too late for this current outbreak but it will be crucial if there is another one, Sky said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/painting-showing-hitler-as-cain-displayed-in-berlin-museum/,"BERLIN: A 1944 painting by German artist George Grosz that depicts Nazi leader Adolf Hitler as the Bible’s fratricidal Cain went on display at the German Historical Museum in Berlin on Tuesday as part of a new permanent exhibition.
Grosz was one of the most important artists focused on political themes during the Weimar Republic in Germany, a period between the end of World War I and the Nazis’ rise to power in 1933.

Grosz immigrated that year to the United States. The Nazis deemed many of his creations “degenerate art” and destroyed them.
The 1944 painting “Cain or Hitler in Hell” depicts a broken Hitler sitting among skeletons as war rages behind him. The biblical Cain murders his brother, Abel, and God condemns him to a life of wandering.
The artwork helps illustrate “how Grosz further developed his critical form after emigration,” said Markus Hilgert, a senior German cultural official.
Grosz himself said the painting shows “Hitler as a fascist monster, or as an apocalyptic beast.”
The painting, purchased from Grosz’s heirs, will be a central part of a new permanent exhibition.
“For me, it is important that now younger people will have access to the painting and the critical view the artist had of Nazism,” Hilgert said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/photos-of-king-tides-globally-show-risks-of-climate-change/,"DEPOE BAY: Tourists, nature lovers and amateur scientists are whipping out their cameras to document the effects of extreme high tides on shorelines from the United States to New Zealand, and by doing so are helping better predict what rising sea levels will mean for coastal communities around the world.
A network of volunteer photographers fans out around the globe during so-called king tides to capture how high the waterline gets and where the water goes. They then upload the images — many with geolocation data embedded — for use by scientists, policymakers and even city planners as they study and prepare for the effects of climate change. The photos show where flooding occurs on specific roads, or give clues about whether it’s safe to build new housing, for example, near an eroding bluff.


“For us, the king tide offers a look at where the water will be in about 2050, about a foot to a foot and half (30 to 46 centimetres) above normal water levels,” said Skip Stiles, executive director of Wetlands Watch, a nonprofit that helped recruit 700 people to document a king tide in Norfolk, Virginia, for the first time there in 2017.
The group’s efforts have since grown into a smartphone app that uses crowdsourcing to gather images and pinpoint flooding.
“What we’re finding is there’s a real appetite for this data. A lot of the localities here are putting together comprehensive plans for sea level rise, and I’m getting calls from them saying, ‘Do you have data? Do you have photos?’ That’s what we’re going for.”
The first of these King Tide Projects involving the public began in 2009 in Australia. The idea has since spread to more than a dozen coastal states in the US, British Columbia, New Zealand, Mauritius and beyond.
King tides occur about twice a year in coastal areas worldwide when the sun and moon align to enhance the gravitational pull that produces normal, daily tides. These super-high tides came into sharp focus in January, when one arrived in Oregon on the same day as a major winter storm, creating 15- to 20-foot (4.6- to 6.1-metre) waves and a massive swell that sucked a man and his two young children out to sea. The woman who called 911 had been photographing the tides from her yard for the Oregon King Tides Project. The children, ages 4 and 7, died.
Citizen scientists are preparing to document this winter’s final king tide Feb 8-10 off the US West Coast, followed by one in New Zealand on Feb 12.
Flooding from king tides is a preview of how sea level rise will affect coastal communities — and warmer oceans and bigger storms could amplify those changes, said Peter Ruggiero, interim executive director of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute. Modeling shows Oregon could experience sea level rise of as little as a foot (30 centimetres) or as great as 6 feet (1.8 metres) in a worst-case scenario, he said.
Some of these King Tide Projects, like the one in Oregon, are run by nonprofit groups, while others are in partnership with state and local governments. They all have the same goal: to educate the public and provide a clear-eyed assessment of how climate change will affect everyday life, from flooded intersections to cows grazing in knee-high salt water, to popular beaches swallowed by waves.
“A lot of the conversation around climate change was what was happening far away and not about what people were going to be experiencing in their own lives,” said Marina Psaros, who helped develop California’s King Tides Project. “The goal of the project was to get people thinking more about climate change locally instead of just polar bears.”
In Georgia, coastal communities constantly struggle with flooding from high tides and storms — a phenomenon dubbed “sunny day flooding” in places across the US South. Chatham County, home to the low-lying city of Savannah, uses dozens of sea level sensors to track tides and collect data for future city planning. It has also begun asking people to snap pictures during flooding.
“The combination of the sensor data and the photos really helps build out the story — and with that, we hope it will solidify funding decisions better,” said Nick Deffley, Savannah’s director of sustainability.
When Auckland, New Zealand, organized its first king tide photo event, people sent in images of flooded parks and freeway underpasses. They shared them with local government, and some of the images were used to develop a plan to reinforce a popular but rapidly eroding beach.
Last year, they expanded the program to include a series of tide gauges that are checked regularly by citizen scientists, said Ben Sheeran, founder of the New Zealand King Tide Project.
“There’s no eureka moment where it all comes into play, but it’s an evolving database of information that’s there when needed,” he said. “And the data we get are a vehicle for people to continue that conversation.”
It’s a conversation that remains lively in places like Oregon, where king tides mean periodic flooding of large parts of the coast.
Last year, two volunteers took photos of it from an airplane, capturing striking images of swamped farmhouses, flooded freeway on-ramps, and miles and miles of salt water-soaked agricultural land.
“That flight was my first vision of homes with water looking like it was within feet of coming up into the home. And you had pastures and farm animals out there that looked like these little dots on an island,” said Rena Olson, who shot the images along with Alex Derr.
The two hope to go up again this weekend.
“Seeing that over such a large area, it really opened my eyes,” Olson said. “This is impactful.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/measles-vaccine-drive-aims-to-protect-45-million-children-in-africa-asia/,"
LONDON: Up to 45 million children in seven developing countries will be immunised against measles in a series of major vaccination campaigns to try to halt a global surge in the viral disease, the GAVI vaccine alliance said on Wednesday.
Measles cases have risen dramatically in all parts of the world in recent years. The World Health Organization said in December that measles had infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children, in what it described as “an outrage.”
“While the headlines might focus on rising cases in Europe and the United States, it is sadly still the case that the vast majority of measles deaths are happening in the world’s poorest countries,” said Seth Berkley, GAVI’s chief executive, who gave a briefing to reporters in London.
The campaigns will be carried out by governments in Bangladesh, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nepal, Somalia and South Sudan and funded by partners including GAVI, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations children’s fund UNICEF.
The aim is to reach some 45 million children in six months.
Provisional data for 2019 up to November showed a three-fold increase in case numbers compared with the same period in 2018, the WHO said.
“Measles cases rose alarmingly in 2019, affecting hundreds of thousands of children and claiming many young lives,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF’s executive director. “These measles outbreaks have taught us that we need to stay vigilant. We can’t afford to wait and watch.”

GSK will make its “adjuvant platform technology” available for developing a vaccine against the 2019-nCoV virus, according to the statement.

The use of adjuvant allows for production of more vaccine doses and hence would increase availability to more people.
GSK will engage with entities funded by the CEPI with the first of these agreements having been signed between the British drugmaker and Australia’s University of Queensland, the statement added.
The fast-moving flu-like virus has killed more than 300 people in China, spread to more than two dozen countries and caused the world’s second largest economy to be hit by travel curbs and business shut-downs.
There is currently no vaccine available against the coronavirus but several organisations including CEPI, a public-private body based in Norway, are working at developing one.
France’s Pasteur Institute Foundation said on Friday it had set up a task force aimed at developing a vaccine against the virus in 20 months while Germany’s research minister said she expected a vaccine to be developed within “a few months”.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/women/nepals-ousted-female-deputy-speaker-vows-to-fight-on-for-gender-equality/,"
KATHMANDU: One of Nepal‘s most senior female politicians has said she was a “victim of patriarchy” after she was forced to stand down as parliament speaker, and vowed to fight for greater equality for women.
Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe took over as acting speaker of Nepal‘s lower house after the incumbent was accused of rape, but the leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Party made her stand down to make way for a male colleague.
The veteran politician, who has a doctorate in political science, said things were now even worse for women than under the monarchy, which was abolished in 2008 after a Maoist revolution.
“Patriarchy is more deeply rooted now than it was under the monarchy,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. “It is even stronger now in our country.”
The abolition of Nepal‘s monarchy came with promises of a more equal society that many historically marginalised groups, including women, do not feel have been fulfilled.
Women’s rights groups were particularly angered by a clause in the new national constitution introduced in 2015 that restricts women from passing on their Nepali citizenship to their children. No such restrictions are placed on men.
Tumbahamphe said she strongly resisted her removal as speaker, giving the men who lead her party a list of reasons why she was the most qualified candidate – and copy of her book about the women’s movement in Nepali politics.
Her replacement on Sunday by Agni Prasad Sapkota, a former Maoist rebel who stands accused of abduction and murder during the country’s decade-long civil war, triggered protests by conflict victims and human rights campaigners.
Nepal‘s post-war constitution mandates that one-third of the country’s lawmakers must be women. The country has a female president – a largely ceremonial role – and briefly had a female chief justice.
But senior women in politics say they still face far greater challenges than men, and are frequently sidelined.
“In my 40 years in politics, I have not noticed much change in the condition of women. That is why I have devoted myself to fighting discrimination and injustice,” said Tumbahamphe.
“There are women in political parties looking after minor areas. But there are few in the policy-making level.”
The 56-year-old, who is widowed and has two children, was born into an indigenous community in the remote hills of eastern Nepal. She has been involved in politics since she was at school, and has held key posts in women’s rights organisations.
It has not been easy, she said. She was recently appointed to her left-wing party’s central committee, the top policy-making body, a position she wants to use to achieve change for women.
“Women must get equal opportunities and access to state resources and power,” she said. “I will continue to fight … to ensure that women get a fair deal.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/people/author-mary-higgins-clark-queen-of-suspense-dies-at-92/,"
NEW YORK: Mary Higgins Clark, the tireless and long-reigning “Queen of Suspense” whose tales of women beating the odds made her one of the world’s most popular writers, died Friday at age 92.
Her publisher, Simon & Schuster, announced that she died of natural causes in Naples, Florida.
“Nobody ever bonded more completely with her readers than Mary did,” her longtime editor Michael Korda said in statement. “She understood them as if they were members of her own family. She was always absolutely sure of what they wanted to read — and, perhaps more important, what they didn’t want to read — and yet she managed to surprise them with every book.”

Widowed in her late 30s with five children, she became a perennial bestseller over the second half of her life, writing or co-writing “A Stranger Is Watching,” “Daddy’s Little Girl” and more than 50 other favorites. Sales topped 100 million copies and honours came from all over, including a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters from France or a Grand Master statuette back home from the Mystery Writers of America. Many of her books, like “A Stranger is Watching” and “Lucky Day,” were adapted for movies and television. She also collaborated on several novels with her daughter, Carol Higgins Clark.
Mary Higgins Clark specialised in women triumphing over danger, such as the besieged young prosecutor in “Just Take My Heart” or the mother of two and art gallery worker whose second husband is a madman in “A Cry in the Night.” Clark’s goal as an author was simple, if rarely easy: Keep the readers reading.
“You want to turn the page,” she told The Associated Press in 2013. “There are wonderful sagas you can thoroughly enjoy a section and put it down. But if you’re reading my book, I want you stuck with reading the next paragraph. The greatest compliment I can receive is, ‘I read your darned book ’til 4 in the morning, and now I’m tired.’ I say, ‘Then you get your money’s worth.'”
Her own life taught her lessons of resilience — strengthened by her Catholic faith — that she shared with her fictional heroines. She was born Mary Higgins in 1927 in New York City, the second of three children. She would later take the last name Clark after marriage. Her father ran a popular pub that did well enough for the family to afford a maid and for her mother to prepare meals for strangers in need. But business slowed during the Great Depression, and her father, forced to work ever longer hours as he laid off employees, died in his sleep in 1939. One of her brothers died of meningitis a few years later. Surviving family members took on odd jobs and had to rent out rooms in the house.
Clark had always loved to write. At age 6, she completed her first poem, which her mother proudly requested she recite in front of the family. A story she wrote in grade school impressed her teacher enough that Clark read it to the rest of the class. By high school, she was trying to sell stories to True Confessions magazine.
After working as a hotel switchboard operator — Tennessee Williams was among the guests she eavesdropped on — and a flight attendant for Pan American, she married Capital Airways regional manager Warren Clark in 1949. Throughout the 1950s and into the ’60s, she raised their children, studied writing at New York University and began getting stories published.
Some stories drew upon her experiences at Pan American. Another story, which appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, “Beauty Contest at Buckingham Palace,” imagined a pageant featuring Queen Elizabeth II, Jackie Kennedy and Princess Grace of Monaco. But by the mid-60s, the magazine market for fiction was rapidly shrinking and her husband’s health was failing; Warren Clark died of a heart attack in 1964.
Clark quickly found work as a script writer for “Portrait of a President,” a radio series on American presidents. Her research inspired her first book, a historical novel about George and Martha Washington. She was so determined that she began getting up at 5 am, working until nearly 7 am before feeding her children and leaving for work.
“Aspire to the Heavens” was published in 1969. It was “a triumph,” she recalled in her memoir “Kitchen Privileges,” but also a folly. The book’s publisher was sold near the release date and it received little attention. She regretted the title and learned that some stores placed the book in religious sections. Her compensation was $1,500, minus commission. Decades later, the novel would be reissued, far more successfully, as “Mount Vernon: A Love Story.”
For her next book, she wanted to make some money. Following a guideline she would often suggest to other writers, she looked at her bookshelves, which featured novels by Agatha Christie, Rex Stout and other mystery writers, and decided she should write the kind of book she liked to read. A recent tabloid trial about a young woman accused of murdering her children gave her an idea.
“It seemed inconceivable to most of us that any woman could do that to her children,” Mary Clark wrote in her memoir. “And then I thought: Suppose an innocent young mother is convicted of the deliberate murder of her two children; suppose she gets out of prison on a technicality; and then suppose seven years to the day, on her 32nd birthday, the children of her second marriage disappear.”
In September 1974, she sent her agent a manuscript for “Die a Little Death,” acquired months later by Simon & Schuster for $3,000. Renamed “Where are the Children?” and released in 1975, it became her first bestseller and began her long, but not entirely surprising, run of success. She would allege that a psychic had told her she would become rich and famous.
Clark, who wrote well into her 90s, more than compensated for her early struggles. She acquired several homes and for a time owned part of the New Jersey Nets. She was among a circle of authors, including Lee Child and Nelson DeMille, who regularly met for dinner in Manhattan. She also had friends in Washington and was a White House guest during the presidential administrations of George HW Bush, Bill Clinton and George W Bush. Barbara Bush became a close friend.
Married since 1996 to former Merrill Lynch Futures CEO John J Conheeney, Clark remembered well the day she said goodbye to hard times. It was in April 1977, and her agent had told her that Simon & Schuster was offering $500,000 for the hardcover to her third novel, “A Stranger is Watching,” and that the publisher Dell was paying $1 million for the paperback. She had been running her own script production company during the day and studying for a philosophy degree at Fordham University at night, returning home to New Jersey in an old car with more than 100,000 miles on it.
“As I drove onto the Henry Hudson Parkway, the tailpipe and muffler came loose and began dragging on the ground. For the next 21 miles, I kur-plunked, kur-plunked, all the way home,” she wrote in her memoir. “People in other cars kept honking and beeping, obviously sure that I was either too stupid or too deaf to hear the racket.
“The next day I bought a Cadillac!”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/do-masks-offer-protection-from-new-virus-it-depends/,"SEATTLE: People around the world are buying up protective face masks in hopes of keeping the new virus from China at bay. Some companies have required them for employees. Schools in South Korea have told parents to equip their children with masks and hand sanitizer when they return from winter vacation.
But do the masks work? It depends.

All viruses are small enough to get through a typical strap-on medical mask, but the germs don’t generally spread through the air one at a time, said Dr Mark Denison of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Denison studies SARS and MERS, which are coronaviruses, the same family as the new virus.
Instead, viruses ride from person to person on droplets from a sneeze or cough. Those droplets land on hands and other surfaces, where they are touched by others, who then touch their own eyes, noses or mouths.
Masks can block large droplets from a sneeze or cough. That means they have some value, Denison said.
Also, someone in a mask can’t touch their own nose and mouth. That can prevent the wearer from picking up germs left on surfaces by someone who is sick, he said.
Masks are “a very sensible precaution” while scientists work to study exactly how the new virus is transmitted, said University of Oxford researcher Trudie Lang.
None of this, however, is based on rigorous research. Nobody has compared groups of masked and unmasked people by exposing them to the new germ, Denison said. A 2017 review of studies in health care workers suggested masks offer some protection against SARS, but the authors noted “existing evidence is sparse and findings are inconsistent.”
The best way to avoid getting sick from the new virus is to wash your hands with soap and water. If soap and water aren’t available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. That’s the same advice for avoiding regular cold and flu viruses.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not currently recommend masks for the general public. Health officials announced Thursday a sixth US case, the husband of a woman who got sick after returning from Wuhan, China, and the first instance of the virus spreading person-to-person in the United States. Health officials said the risk to the general public in the US remains low.
The CDC does recommend masks for people being evaluated for the new virus, people confirmed to have it, household members and caregivers. Airline crew should offer a face mask to a sick traveler, the CDC said.
Health care workers treating patients with the new virus are advised by the CDC to take additional precautions such as goggles or face shields.
UNICEF said Wednesday it has shipped six metric tons of respiratory masks and protective suits to China for use by health workers.
In Tokyo, 21-year-old hotel employee Hasumi Tsuchida said she wears a mask. “I work in a hotel where many guests are from China,” she said. “I worry a bit when foreign guests arrive.”
Masks have been commonly used in some countries when wearers are sick, fighting allergies or on days when air pollution is bad. The new virus has fueled demand for them around the world.
Respilon, a Czech company that makes its “nanofiber” masks in China, sold 700,000 of them last year worldwide. Since last week, it received orders for 7 million more. The problem: It cannot make any because the Chinese government extended the Lunar New Year holiday in a bid to contain the virus’ spread.
In Taiwan, where the holiday is over, factories are up and running. Premier Su Tseng-chang said the government had already distributed 23 million masks and that Taiwan will be able to produce 4 million more a day.
A mask factory in Shanghai has gone into overdrive despite the holiday.
“We are now working 24 hours, two shifts a day, 12 hours shift,” said Liao Huolin, president of the mask company. “We violated labor law,” Liao said, “but the workers understand.”

KATHMANDU: Publication House Nepalaya is all set to start 2020 with a new set of women leaders, Nepalaya said in a press statement today. Both the executive positions linked to editorial and management will now be taken up by women candidates.
Management will be headed by Saijan Maskey and Editorial will be led by Bhushita Vasistha.
Maskey is a student of Marketing and longtime Nepalaya associate. Vasistha is a student of literature, a writer, and an avid reader.
The new publication team has been working to creating a fresh catalogue for the year 2020, reads the statement.
“I am confident the new team will bring freshness not only to the Nepalaya catalogue but to the saturated Nepali publication industry as well,” said Kiran Krishna Shrestha of Nepalaya.
Talking about her new undertaking and responsibility as a publisher of Nepalaya, Bhushita Vasistha said, “Publishing women writers is to publish pluralised voices, the voices from the margin that often get lost in the process of being translated into standardised language of hegemony. Pluralised publishing is a special privilege that only democratic society can safeguard. And in turn democracy can only thrive in the hands of well-informed citizens, who can empathise beyond their immediate prejudice. Not surprising then, we will begin the year with celebrating women writers.”
Sharing publication Nepa-laya’s management policy adaptation, CEO of Publication Nepa-laya Saijan Maskey said, “We have published 45 books so far and we believe that this year will mark our long term policy to publish and disseminate the voice from the margin, of which women form a significant part.” She further added, “At Nepalaya, we have always been looking for works with longer shelf life, and we will continue to focus in that direction.”
“As one of the players in the industry, it becomes our responsibility to provide new impetus to the industry, which we have been doing since our first publication Palpasa Café in 2005,” said Kiran Krishna Shrestha, founder of Nepalaya. “With the new leadership, I look forward to seeing Nepalaya contribute more to the industry and the Nepali readers,” he added.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/readiness-key-to-detect-combat-spread-of-new-coronavirus-who/,"KATHMANDU: The World Health Organization (WHO), South-East Asia has urged countries in the Region to remain vigilant and strengthen readiness to rapidly detect any case of importation of the new coronavirus and prevent its spread.
“It is time to focus all efforts on readiness guided by whatever is known about the new coronavirus,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region.
Through a press release issued by WHO, South-East Asia, the Regional Director said, as in the case of any new virus, much remains to be understood. She added that globally WHO has prepared interim guidance on case detection, testing, clinical management of cases, infection prevention and control during health care, home care for people suspected to have the virus, and guidance on reducing transmission.

WHO is working with countries in the Region to roll out these guidelines, prioritising reviewing and building capacities for laboratory diagnostic, including referral of specimens and diagnosis; trainings in case management, specimen collection and transportation, and infection prevention and control; logistics support and communicating risks and promoting desired behavior in the community.
According to the statement, the Regional Director has been in contact with the Ministers of Health since the onset of the outbreak. Last week she took stock of the preparedness and support being extended by WHO to countries.
Two countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region – Thailand and Nepal – have reported confirmed cases of the new coronavirus.
Globally, WHO continues to work with networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the disease and limit onward transmission.
Though the new coronavirus — being called novel coronavirus-2019 was not declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulation which met last week, its risk was assessed to be ‘high’.
WHO is keeping a close watch on the evolving situation and remains committed to work with member countries to scale up readiness and implement IHR core capacities to respond to any importation, the WHO Regional Director was quoted in the statement. She emphasised, “We should continue to be vigilant and ready to contain and prevent any further spread.”
WHO’s South-East Asia Region comprises the following 11 member states: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Timor-Leste.

“We need you to act faster”, read the open letter, addressed to world leaders who in 2015 signed up to a series of UN global goals to tackle poverty, inequality and climate change by 2030.

“There are not just a few of us – there are millions with one voice and one question. How will you keep your promise and deliver dramatic progress towards the global goals this year?”
“Love, Actually” director Richard Curtis, who has campaigned for the global goals and was among the letter’s signatories, said there had been “nothing like enough progress” in the five years since the goals were set.
But he said growing public awareness of issues ranging from climate change to modern slavery was forcing companies and governments to change their behaviour, citing Microsoft’s recent pledge to remove all the carbon it has ever emitted.
“People are becoming increasingly aware of their own lives,,” Curtis told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“Talk to your companies about pensions, be careful about what you eat, what you wear, how you travel, and also talk to your politicians about these issues.”
A United Nations assessment last year found that progress has been made on the goal of ending extreme poverty, but in other areas, “progress has been slow or even reversed”.
The letter was co-ordinated by Project Everyone, which was co-founded by Curtis to raise awareness of global development goals, and signed by 2,020 activists from around the world.
The signatories include the co-founder of Black Lives Matter Patrisse Cullors; Obiageli Ezekwesili, who co-founded the Bring Back Our Girls movement in Nigeria, and Nobel peace laureate and Yazidi activist Nadia Murad.
It was published a week after the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on the world to make the 2020s a “decade of action” to deliver the global goals, warning it was still “off track”.
“At present course, half a billion people will still be living in extreme poverty by 2030,” he said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/health-experts-human-to-human-spread-of-new-virus-worrying/,"BEIJING: World health officials expressed “great concern” Wednesday that a dangerous new virus is starting to spread between people outside of China, a troubling development as China and the world frantically work to contain the outbreak. For a second day, the number of infections grew dramatically.
The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. On Wednesday, the number of cases jumped to 5,974, surpassing the 5,327 people diagnosed with SARS.
The death toll, which rose to 170 on Wednesday, is still less than half the number who died in China from SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Scientists say there are many questions to be answered about the new virus, including just how easily it spreads and how severe it is.
In a report published Wednesday, Chinese researchers suggested that person-to-person spread among close contacts occurred as early as mid-December. Based on the first 425 confirmed cases, the researchers estimate that each infection led to 2.2 others on average. That’s a bit more than ordinary flu but far less than some other respiratory diseases such as whooping cough and tuberculosis. The rate for SARS, a cousin to this new virus, was estimated to be 3.
“Considerable efforts” will be needed to control the spread if this ratio holds up elsewhere, researchers wrote in the report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
More than half of the cases in which symptoms began before Jan. 1 were tied to a seafood market, but only 8% of cases after that have been, researchers found. They reported the average incubation period was five days.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief said the few cases of human-to-human spread of the virus outside China — in Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam — were of “great concern” and were part of the reason the U.N. health agency’s director-general was reconvening a committee of experts on Thursday to assess whether the outbreak should be declared a global emergency.
Dr. Michael Ryan spoke at a news conference in Geneva after returning from a trip to Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior government leaders. He said China was taking “extraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge” posed by the outbreak.
To date, about 99% of the nearly 6,000 cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at 2%, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it’s likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed.
In comparison, the SARS virus killed about 10% of people who caught it. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS.
Ryan noted there were several aspects of the new virus outbreak that are extremely worrying, citing the recent rapid spike in cases in China. He said that while scientists believe the outbreak was sparked by an animal virus, it’s unclear if there are other factors driving the epidemic.
“Without understanding that, it’s very hard to put into context the current transmission dynamics,” he said.
Meanwhile, countries began evacuating their citizens from the Chinese city hardest-hit by the virus. Chartered planes carrying about 200 evacuees each arrived in Japan and the United States as other countries planned similar evacuations from the city of Wuhan, which authorities have shut down to try to contain the virus.
The U.S. plane arrived in California after a refueling stop in Alaska. All 195 passengers, who included diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, passed health screenings in China and Anchorage, and were to undergo three days of monitoring at a Southern California military base to ensure they show no signs of the illness.
“The whole plane erupted into cheers when the crew welcomed them back to the United States,” Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer, told reporters in Anchorage.
Four passengers on the evacuation flight to Japan had coughs and fevers, and two were diagnosed with pneumonia. It wasn’t clear whether they were infected with the new virus, which first appeared in Wuhan in December. Its symptoms, including cough and fever and in severe cases pneumonia, are similar to many other illnesses.
Takeo Aoyama, an employee at Nippon Steel Corp.’s subsidiary in Wuhan, told reporters he was relieved to return home.
“We were feeling increasingly uneasy as the situation developed so rapidly and we were still in the city,” Aoyama said, his voice muffled by a white surgical mask.
The first cases in the Middle East were confirmed Wednesday, a family of four from Wuhan that was visiting the United Arab Emirates. Airlines around the world announced they were cutting flights to China, and Hong Kong was suspending rail travel to and from the mainland at midnight.
The number of cases in China rose to 1,459 from the previous day, a smaller increase than the 1,771 new cases reported Tuesday. Australia, Finland and Singapore were among those reporting new cases, as the number outside China topped 70. The vast majority are people who came from Wuhan.
Australia, New Zealand and Britain were among the latest countries to announce they are planning evacuations.
British health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that “anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.” The measures are a step up from those during the devastating 2014-16 Ebola outbreak, when returning travelers from West Africa were asked to monitor themselves for symptoms.
Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said the steps are justified to prevent the introduction of the virus and its spread.
“There’s always a balance between the draconian measures of public health and what people might want to do, and obviously it’s regrettable if people who turn out not to have the virus are quarantined unnecessarily,” he said.
In China’s Hubei province, 17 cities including Wuhan have been locked down, trapping more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed.
During the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, China was slammed for hiding that outbreak for months, allowing it to spread unchecked before reporting it to the WHO. Even after inviting international experts to investigate the epidemic, SARS patients were moved from hospitals and driven around in ambulances to conceal the true extent of the virus’ spread.
Although the Chinese health minister and others have suggested that the virus is spreading before people get symptoms, data to confirm that has not yet been shared widely beyond China.
“It’s still unclear whether that takes place,” said Malik Peiris, chair in virology at the University of Hong Kong.
“The fortunate thing about SARS, if there was anything fortunate, was that transmission did not take place before symptoms,” he said. If it turns out that the new coronavirus can indeed be spread by people who don’t show any symptoms, “a pandemic is a scenario that we have to consider.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/heavy-rains-dampen-fires-in-australias-queensland-state-cause-flooding/,"MELBOURNE: Australia’s bushfire-stricken state of Queensland saw heavy rainfalls on Sunday dampening some of the fires that have razed 2.5 million hectares (1.2 million acres) of land since September, but the wet weather caused major flooding.
Some areas received a quarter of the annual average rainfall, according to Reuters’ calculations, with the state‘s Bureau of Meteorology saying coastal areas experienced up to 160 millimetres (6.3 inches) of rain in the 24-hour period to 9 am on Sunday.
“More rain expected over the coming days,” the bureau said on Twitter.
Several people were rescued from floodwaters and some bridges and causeways were closed, but no severe damage had been reported.
Recent rains across drought-hit Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales states have substantially dampened many of the hundreds of bushfires that have burnt an area nearly the size of Greece and killed 33 people and millions of animals since September.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/with-wuhan-virus-genetic-code-in-hand-scientists-begin-work-on-a-vaccine/,"
CHICAGO/LONDON: When a newly organised vaccine research group at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) met for the first time this week, its members had expected to be able to ease into their work.
But their mandate is to conduct human trials for emerging health threats – and their first assignment came at shocking speed.
In just three months time, they likely will be testing the first of a number of potential experimental vaccines against the new SARS-like coronavirus that is spreading in China and beyond.

“I told them, ‘you are going to have your baptism of fire, folks’,” Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases within NIH, said of his inaugural address to the group this week.
Three months from gene sequence to initial human testing would be the fastest the agency has ever gotten such a vaccine off the ground, Fauci said.
The outbreak, which began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, as of Friday had infected more than 800 people in China and killed 26. Cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal and the United States.
Chinese scientists were able to quickly identify the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus and officials posted it publicly within a few days, allowing scientific research teams to get to work right away.
With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development work without needing a sample of the virus.
During the deadly 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, it took US scientists 20 months to go from genetic sequence to the first phase of human trials. By that time, the outbreak was under control.
This time, research groups worldwide are already executing plans to test vaccines, treatments and other countermeasures to stop the newly identified virus from spreading globally.
MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH
They are attacking from several angles, with global health and epidemic response agencies hoping at least one treatment will be in human trials within a few months.
Fauci’s agency is partnering with US biotech Moderna Inc , which specializes in vaccines based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) – a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins.
That team hopes to make an RNA vaccine based on one of the crown-like spikes on the surface of the coronavirus that gives the family of viruses their name, an approach that, unlike many vaccines, would not expose people to the virus.
At the University of Queensland in Australia, scientists backed by the global health emergency group the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said they are working on what they describe as a “molecular clamp” vaccine approach.
The technology adds a gene to viral proteins to stabilize them and trick the body into thinking it is seeing a live virus and create antibodies against it.
Keith Chappell, an expert in the University’s school of chemistry and molecular biosciences, said the technology is designed as “a platform approach to generate vaccines against a range of human and animal viruses.”
It has already shown promising results in lab tests on other dangerous viruses such as Ebola and the coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)- a cousin of SARS and the Wuhan virus.
Novavax, which already has a vaccine in development against MERS, says it is now working on one for the Wuhan coronavirus.
Scientists also are turning to infection-fighting proteins known as monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, that were developed against the SARS and MERS coronaviruses.
The hope is that similarities with the Wuhan virus will offer enough overlap in the antibodies to help people infected in the China outbreak.
Vir Biotechnology Chief Scientific Officer Herbert Virgin said his company has a library of monoclonal antibodies that have shown some success against SARS and MERS in lab tests.
Some of these antibodies have been shown to neutralize coronaviruses, Virgin said, and “may have the potential to treat and prevent (the) Wuhan coronavirus.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/health-health/mexican-security-forces-detain-800-central-american-migrants/,"
FRONTERA HIDALGO: Mexican authorities on Thursday adopted tougher measures against Central American migrants, detaining 800 of them who had entered Mexico illegally from Guatemala intending to reach the border with the United States.
Mexico is under intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to contain mass movements of migrants, most of them from Central America, who have been crossing through Mexico on their way to the US border.

The National Migration Institute (INM) said it had transferred 800 migrants, some of them unaccompanied minors, to immigration centers where they would be given food, medical attention and shelter.
If their legal status cannot be resolved, they will be returned to their home countries. The INM also said it was looking for another 200 migrants who had remained in the area.
Earlier in the day, security forces with riot shields corralled migrants, including families with small children, after they had entered Mexico across the Suchiate River from Guatemala.
Some migrants in the caravan had been given forms to seek asylum with Mexico’s asylum agency, COMAR. Many of the migrants heading north say they are fleeing economic hardship and violence at home.
The current group is the largest surge of people to test Mexico since its president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, reached agreements with Trump and some central American governments to reduce pressure on the US border.
Trump has threatened to punish Mexico and Central American countries economically if they fail to rein in migrant flows.
Migrants crossing into Mexico this week faced tear gas from security forces, in a firmer response than seen in previous mass crossings.
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said several hundred of the new arrivals were immediately deported.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/how-climate-change-feeds-africa-locust-invasion/,"
JOHANNESBURG: Locusts by the millions are nibbling their way across a large part of Africa in the worst outbreak some places have seen in 70 years. Is this another effect of a changing climate? Yes, researchers say. An unprecedented food security crisis may be the result.
Here’s a look at what’s going on and where the voracious insects might be going next.
A LOCUST OUTBREAK? WHAT’S THAT LIKE?
The swarms of desert locusts hang like shimmering dark clouds on the horizon as they scour the countryside in what are already some of the world’s most vulnerable countries, including Somalia. Roughly the length of a finger, the whirring insects in huge numbers are destroying hundreds of thousands of acres of crops and forcing people in some areas to bodily wade through them.
“A typical desert locust swarm can contain up to 150 million locusts per square kilometer,” the East African regional body, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, has said. “Swarms migrate with the wind and can cover 100 to 150 kilometers (62 to 93 miles) in a day. An average swarm can destroy as much food crops in a day as is sufficient to feed 2,500 people.”
Alarm and exasperation mix with curiosity as people try to shoo the locusts away by shouting, waving pieces of clothing or banging on sheets of corrugated metal. In rural Kenya, men dashed along a path waving leafy branches at the insects and laughing in astonishment.
“These things here, they came to us from Ethiopia and are destroying everything along the way including our farm,” said Esther Ndanu in the Kenyan village of Ngomeni. “We want the government to move very quickly to bring the plane to spray them with the medicine that can kill them, otherwise they will destroy everything.”
“I am seeing a catastrophe,” local official Johnson Mutua Kanandu added.
WHERE IS THIS HAPPENING?
An “extremely dangerous increase” in locust swarm activity has been reported in Kenya, East Africa’s economic hub, regional authorities reported last week. One swarm measured 60 kilometers (37 miles) long by 40 kilometers (25 miles) wide in the country’s northeast, IGAD said.
Kenya hasn’t seen a locust outbreak like this in 70 years, Rosanne Marchesich, emergency response leader with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, said Wednesday.
“It’s the worst that we’ve seen in Ethiopia and in Somalia in 25 years,” she added, noting extensive damage to crops. Millions of people in both countries already cope with the constant risk of drought or flooding, as well as deadly unrest in Ethiopia and extremist attacks in Somalia.
Now South Sudan, struggling to emerge from a civil war, and Uganda are bracing for the locusts’ arrival.
“Uganda has not had to deal with a locust infestation since the ’60s so there is concern about the ability for experts on the ground to be able to deal with it without external support,” Marchesich said. “And in a country like South Sudan, already 47% of the population is food insecure.”
This week Uganda’s prime minister told agriculture authorities that “this is an emergency and all agencies must be on the alert,” the government-controlled New Vision newspaper reported.
HOW IS CLIMATE CHANGE INVOLVED?
Heavy rains in East Africa made 2019 one of the region’s wettest years on record, said Nairobi-based climate scientist Abubakr Salih Babiker. He blamed rapidly warming waters in the Indian Ocean off Africa’s eastern coast, which also spawned an unusual number of strong tropical cyclones off Africa last year.
Heavy rainfall and warmer temperatures are favorable conditions for locust breeding and in this case the conditions have become “exceptional,” he said.
Even now rainfall continues in some parts of the vast region. The greenery that springs up keeps the locusts fuelled.
“Countries are trying to prepare but this took them by surprise,” Babiker said.
The further increase in locust swarms could last until June as favorable breeding conditions continue, IGAD has said. But Babiker said it is hard to say for sure when this outbreak will be over.
“This has become psychologically pressurizing,” he said, delicately.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
Major locust outbreaks can be devastating. One between 2003 and 2005 cost more than $500 million to control across 20 countries in northern Africa, the FAO has said. It caused more than $2.5 billion in harvest losses.
To help prevent and control outbreaks, authorities analyze satellite images, stockpile pesticides and conduct aerial spraying. In Ethiopia, officials have said they deployed four small planes to help fight the invasion.
“But that is not enough,” Marchesich with the FAO said of monitoring and control measures. “We also have to have anticipatory approaches to safeguard the livelihoods of the farmers and the agriculturalists.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/more-vegetables-doctors-visits-for-shanghai-elderly-looking-to-beat-virus/,"
SHANGHAI: Senior citizens in China’s commercial capital of Shanghai are taking preventive steps against the spread of a new virus, monitoring their health, staying indoors to reduce exposure, and even giving up meat.
Authorities say the coronavirus, which has killed 17 and infected nearly 600 people since it first emerged late last year, originated from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in the central city of Wuhan.
With hundreds of millions of Chinese gearing up for travel during Lunar New Year holidays that begin on Saturday, officials fearing an accelerated spread of the virus have imposed a lockdown on Wuhan.
“I think this new year is going to be less festive,” said a 70-year-old man who stood outside a bustling clinic in Shanghai, wearing a mask and waiting to see a doctor because he had felt feverish the previous night.
“It’s better to be safe and this way I won’t affect other people,” said the man, who gave only his surname, Xia, as he pulled down his mask in order to smoke.
“I’m trying to smoke less too,” he laughed as he looked at his cigarette.
Immune systems weakening with age are seen as making the elderly more susceptible to infections and diseases, and most virus victims have been older than 60 or suffered pre-existing conditions. The youngest was a 48-year-old woman.
Another elderly resident of Shanghai said she was avoiding crowded places or areas with animals.
“I go straight to where I need to go, and then I go home,” said 79-year-old Li Meihua, from behind a mask. “My nose is a bit runny already. I’m also maintaining a cleaner diet, I’ve turned vegetarian now.”
At a Taiwan vegetarian restaurant located beside a Buddhist temple, since some Buddhists follow a vegetarian diet, a waitress said it had drawn some new diners since the outbreak.
“Some told me they come to have vegetarian food, as it’s cleaner and healthier,” she told Reuters. “But it’s not too busy now, people have left the city as New Year is coming soon.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/man-quarantined-after-hong-kongs-first-preliminary-positive-test-for-wuhan-virus/,"HONG KONG: Hong Kong quarantined a 39-year-old man on Wednesday after the city’s first preliminary positive result in a test for the new flu-like coronavirus found in an outbreak in central mainland China, authorities said.
The tourist from Wuhan came to Hong Kong on Tuesday via high-speed rail from nearby Shenzhen and was detected having fever at the border. He was in stable condition in an isolation ward at Princess Margaret Hospital, Health Minister Sophia Chan said.
The outbreak has spread to more Chinese cities including the capital Beijing, Shanghai and Macau, and cases have been reported outside the country’s borders, in the United States, South Korea, Thailand and Japan.
Nine people in China have died.
“I urge citizens not to go to Hubei province, Wuhan city if not necessary,” Chan said in a news conference.
She said the isolated patient came to Hong Kong with four family members, who spent the night at a hotel in the busy Tsim Sha Tsui tourist district, before hopping on a flight to Manila earlier on Wednesday.
His family did not have any symptoms. The government was contacting train passengers who sat near him and they would be put under observation in isolation wards. A hotline was also set up for people worried they might have contracted the virus.
Chan could not immediately confirm local media reports of a second person with similar test results.
The Hospital Authority on Tuesday enhanced laboratory surveillance for pneumonia cases to include patients with travel history to all of mainland China, rather than just Wuhan.
Hong Kong had deployed temperature screening equipment at the airport and the high-speed rail station. Air passengers are required to fill in health declaration forms. Some 500 isolation wards at public hospitals were available, with more ordinary wards to be converted if necessary.
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses named because of crown-like spikes on their surfaces. The viruses cause respiratory illnesses ranging from the common cold to the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
Hong Kong was badly hit by the SARS virus in 2003 and has had many episodes of H5N1 bird flu for more than a decade. According to WHO figures, 1,755 people in Hong Kong contracted the SARS virus at the time and 299 died.
The SARS virus remains engrained in Hong Kongers’ memory.
Many of the city’s residents wear surgical masks often, shopping malls provide sanitizers at receptions, staff at office buildings and condominiums clean door handles and elevator buttons several times a day.
Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd will allow all crew members and frontline employees to wear surgical masks and said passengers to and from Wuhan could change or cancel flights for free through February 15.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/hong-kong-on-high-alert-to-tackle-coronavirus-outbreak/,"DAVOS, SWITZERLAND: Hong Kong‘s government is on high alert to deal with a new flu-like coronavirus that has killed nine people in mainland China, the city’s commerce secretary, Edward Yau, said on Wednesday.
The outbreak has rattled financial markets as investors recall the huge impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.
Yau is part of a delegation on a mission to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos to convince global business and political leaders that the Asian financial hub is back on track after more than seven months of protests, even as it faces a potentially more damaging crisis.
“The whole world is watching this new epidemic … We are also getting fully prepared for this because of such close proximity between Hong Kong and the mainland, and very hectic travel,” Yau told Reuters.
During the Lunar New Year celebrations, tens of millions of Chinese travel domestically, starting from this week.
“Policy is on high alert, making sure that we can contain and prevent the spreading of the disease.”
The virus, originating in Wuhan at the end of last year, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.
There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in Hong Kong, although the Chinese-ruled gambling hub of Macau confirmed on Wednesday its first case of pneumonia linked to the coronavirus.
Yau also said the former British colony was well placed to address any cyclical and structural challenges, just days after Moody’s downgraded the financial hub, blaming the government for failing to deal with the sometimes violent protests.
Speaking about the city’s “one country, two systems” formula of governance, Yau said Hong Kong was holding on “steadfastly” to the system.
Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy under the “one country, two systems” formula, including a free press and independent judiciary.
Many protesters believe Beijing has been steadily encroaching on that promised autonomy, something that China denies.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/science-says-what-to-know-about-the-viral-outbreak-in-china/,"Health authorities are closely watching an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a new virus that originated in China. Governments are stepping up surveillance of airline passengers from central China and taking other steps to try to control the outbreak.
Here’s what you should know about the illness:
WHAT IS THE NEW VIRUS?
Scientists have identified it as a new coronavirus. The name comes from the Latin word for crowns or halos, which coronaviruses resemble under a microscope. The coronavirus family has many types that affect people. Some cause the common cold while others originating in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses such as SARS — severe acute respiratory syndrome — or MERS — Middle East respiratory syndrome.
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?
The first cases appeared last month in Wuhan, a city in central China’s Hubei province. Many of the first people infected had visited or worked at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which has since been closed for an investigation. Chinese health officials say they believe the illness first spread from animals to people. They now say it can spread between people.
HOW WIDESPREAD IS IT?
China has identified 440 cases and nine deaths, most of the illnesses and all of the deaths in Hubei province. Cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, the US and Taiwan. The outbreak coincides with China’s busiest travel season as people visit their families or go abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday. That travel rush is expected to spread the disease more widely.
WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?
Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In serious cases, the virus can cause pneumonia.
HOW IS IT TREATED?
There is a test to identify the virus, but no vaccine to prevent an infection. Patients with the virus have been isolated in hospitals or homes to prevent spreading it. The symptoms are treated with pain and fever medication, and people are advised to drink plenty of liquids and rest while they recover.
HOW IS IT SPREADING?
Many coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Scientists believe the new virus can spread from person to person in close contact through the respiratory tract.
COULD IT BE AS BAD AS SARS?
So far, the virus appears less dangerous and infectious than SARS, which also started in China in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people. However, viruses can mutate into more dangerous and contagious forms, and it’s too early to say what will happen with this one.

Chinese health expert confirms virus can pass person-to-person
Fourth person dies from pneumonia in city of Wuhan
Authorities have so far confirmed at least 217 cases

SHANGHAI: The Chinese official investigating a pneumonia outbreak stemming from a new coronavirus said the disease can spread from person to person but can be halted with increased vigilance, as authorities on Tuesday confirmed a fourth death.
Zhong Nanshan said there was no danger of a repeat of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic that killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-2003 outbreak, which started in China, as long as precautions were taken.
“It took only two weeks to identify the novel coronavirus,” state news agency Xinhua quoted Zhong as saying late on Monday.
The outbreak was still in its early stages and China had good surveillance and quarantine systems to help control it, he added.

The outbreak has spread from the central city of Wuhan to cities including Beijing and Shanghai, with more than 200 cases reported so far. Four cases have been reported outside China – in South Korea, Thailand and Japan.
Australia on Tuesday said it would screen passengers on flights from Wuhan amid rising concerns that the virus will spread globally as Chinese travellers take flights abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday starting this week.
Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travellers from Wuhan.
Chinese authorities confirmed a total of 217 cases of the virus in China as of 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Monday, state television reported, 198 of which were in Wuhan.
A fourth person died on Jan. 19, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said. The 89-year-old man, who had underlying health diseases including coronary heart disease, developed symptoms on Jan. 13 and was admitted to hospital five days later, it added.
Zhong, who is renowned in China for his work fighting SARS in 2003, confirmed that the virus can pass from person-to-person.
Fifteen medical workers in Wuhan had been diagnosed with pneumonia, with one other suspected case, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said. Of the infected staff, one was in critical condition.
In Shanghai, officials on Tuesday confirmed a second case involving a 35-year-man who had visited Wuhan in early January, and said they were monitoring four other suspected cases.
The virus causes a type of pneumonia and belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as SARS. Symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for screening efforts.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday an animal source appeared most likely to be the primary origin of the outbreak and that some “limited human-to-human transmission” occurred between close contacts.
The Geneva-based U.N. agency convened an emergency committee for Wednesday to assess whether the outbreak constitutes an international health emergency and what measures should be taken to manage it.
So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions, but a panel of independent experts could do so or make other recommendations to limit spread.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cases-of-new-viral-pneumonia-in-china-surpass-200/,"BEIJING: China reported a sharp rise in the number of people infected with a new coronavirus on Monday, including the first cases in the capital. The outbreak coincides with the country’s busiest travel period, as millions board trains and planes for the Lunar New Year holidays.
Health authorities in the central city of Wuhan, where the viral pneumonia appears to have originated, said an additional 136 cases have been confirmed in the city, which now has a total of 198 infected patients. As of the weekend, a third patient had died, bringing the death toll to three.
Two individuals in Beijing and one in the southern city of Shenzhen have also been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, health commissions in the respective cities said Monday. The three people had visited Wuhan.
The outbreak has put other countries on alert as millions of Chinese travel for Lunar New Year. Authorities in Thailand and in Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China.
South Korea reported its first case Monday, when a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the new coronavirus one day after arriving at Seoul’s Incheon airport. The woman has been isolated at a state-run hospital in Incheon city, just west of Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.
At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three US airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.
Videos posted online show people in protective suits checking one-by-one the temperatures of plane passengers arriving in Macao from Wuhan. A man surnamed Yang who works for the Macao Health Bureau confirmed over the phone that such checks are indeed taking place in the southern Chinese region.
Many of the initial cases of the coronavirus had connections to a seafood market in Wuhan, which was closed as an investigation was underway.
As hundreds of people who came into close contact with diagnosed patients were not infected themselves, the municipal health commission maintains that the virus is not easily transmitted between humans, though it has not ruled out limited human-to-human transmission.
China’s National Health Commission said experts have judged the current outbreak to be “preventable and controllable.”
“However, the source of the new type of coronavirus has not been found, we do not fully understand how the virus is transmitted, and changes in the virus still need to be closely monitored,” the commission said in a statement Sunday.
Coronaviruses cause diseases ranging from the common cold to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS first infected people in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800. The Chinese government initially tried to conceal the severity of the SARS epidemic, but its cover-up was exposed by a high-ranking physician.
“In the early days of SARS, reports were delayed and covered up,” said an editorial in the nationalistic Global Times. “That kind of thing must not happen again in China.”
“We have made great strides in medicine, social affairs management and public opinion since 2003,” the editorial said.
China is putting forth its “utmost efforts to tackle the situation,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday.
The government has notified and maintained close communication with the World Health Organization and other relevant countries and regions, Geng said, adding that Wuhan has adopted measures to control the flow of people leaving the city.
The virus causing the current outbreak is different from those previously identified, Chinese scientists said earlier this month. Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus include fever, cough, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath.
On the Weibo social media platform, which is widely used in China, people posted prevention advice such as wearing masks and washing hands. State broadcaster CCTV recommended staying warm, increasing physical activity, eating lightly and avoiding crowded places. Some people said they had canceled their travel plans and were staying home for Lunar New Year.

SHANGHAI: An outbreak of coronavirus in China is spreading to more cities, Chinese authorities reported on Monday, with 139 new cases found over the weekend, including a third death.
The Daxing health commission in the capital Beijing said it had confirmed two cases of coronavirus, while the southern Guangdong province’s health commission confirmed one case in Shenzhen.
The new cases, the first inside China outside the central city of Wuhan where the virus was first reported, come as the country gears up for the Lunar New Year holidays later this week, when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel domestically and abroad.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement that 136 new cases of coronavirus had been discovered in the city on Saturday and Sunday.
As of late Sunday, 198 cases in total had been reported in Wuhan, including three deaths. Some 170 people were still being treated in the hospital, while 25 had been cured, it said. The statement gave no further details of the latest death toll.
Outside China, two cases have been reported in Thailand and one in Japan, all involving people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city.
Beijing said on Sunday it will increase efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, while health authorities around the world are working to prevent its spread.
The new virus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.
Some experts say the new virus may not be as deadly as SARS, but there is still little known about it including its origin and how easily it can be transmitted between humans.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/tb-patients-continue-to-face-medication-barrier/,"Kathmandu, January 18 
TB patients continue to experience barriers in access, diagnosis and completion of treatment.
Researchers said barriers to access health centres were long distance, poor road condition and costs associated with travelling.
Challenges in mitigating mortality associated with tuberculosis were barriers like access to health services, diagnosis and adherence to treatment, researchers said.
A research was conducted by Dr Sujan Babu Marahatta working at Manmohan Memorial Institute of Health Sciences and his team in six districts of Tarai, hilly and mountain regions — Tanahun, Kaski, Parsa, Nawalparasi, Mustang and Kathmandu.
The researchers found that scarcity of staff at health facilities was a major problem in Nepal. This was echoed by respondents in all the six districts.
The study was conducted among health service providers, traditional healers, tuberculosis patients and community members.
The participants said irregularity of staffers, office hours and absence of staffers at health facilities were major impediments for patients.
The research titled ‘Barriers in Access, Diagnosis and Treatment Completion for Tuberculosis Patients in Central and Western Nepal: A Qualitative Study Among Patients, Community Members and Health Care Workers’ was published in Plus One Journal.
The researchers have pointed out that health centres often lacked enough lab staffers and reagents to detect new cases of TB. Early diagnosis of TB was hindered by lack of trained health staffers for using equipment, lack of equipment and irregular presence of health workers, according to researchers. Lack of staff, who could detect, treat and dispense medicine for tuberculosis was a major problem resulting in missed opportunity for diagnosis, delayed initiation of the medicine, inadequate counselling and poor adherence to medication, according to the report.
“One of the most pronounced factors from all the respondents in all districts was the distance to the health centre. Coupled with the geographical barriers to access, for instance, uphill route, forested path and rivers/springs along the path towards health centres discouraged patients from accessing health services,” said Dr Marahatta. “The main objective of this study was to explore factors affecting access to health services, diagnosis and treatment completion for TB patients in central and western Nepal,” added Dr Marahatta.
The research team also suggested enhancing efficiency of health facilities by adequately mobilising required human resources and by ensuring provision of equipment for diagnosis of TB and medications for TB treatment.
“Health centres can be improved by ensuring skilled human resources and equipment for diagnosis, increasing awareness and collaborating with traditional healers.
Health services utilisation can be enhanced by compensating direct and indirect costs, including modification in the current DOTS strategy by providing medicine for longer term under the supervision of family member or a community member utilising the elements of community engagement,” researchers suggested.
TB is caused by bacteria — mycobacterium tuberculosis that most often affects the lungs.
TB spreads from person to person through the air. When patients cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air.
Around 45,000 new TB cases are added each year. As per National Tuberculosis Centre, an estimated 32,000 cases have been registered under National Tuberculosis Programme, each year.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/china-reports-new-wuhan-virus-cases-ahead-of-key-holiday/,"
BEIJING: Chinese health authorities said on Saturday they had discovered four more cases of pneumonia following an outbreak of what is believed to be a new coronavirus strain in the central city of Wuhan, raising concerns that the disease could spread further.
The four individuals were diagnosed with pneumonia on Thursday and are in stable condition, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement published shortly after midnight, a day after it confirmed the death of a second patient.
Nearly 50 people are known to have been infected and so far involve only individuals who have travelled to or live in Wuhan, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that a wider outbreak is possible. Many of China’s 1.4 billion people will be travelling abroad during the Lunar New Year holidays next week, raising concerns about the disease spreading to other countries.
A report published by the London Imperial College’s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis asserted there are likely “substantially more cases” of the new coronavirus than the 45 currently announced by Wuhan authorities.
A summary of the report on the centre’s website says its baseline scenario estimates that there would be 1,723 cases showing the onset of related symptoms by Jan 12. The full report was not available, however.
The Wuhan commission referred queries on the report to China’s National Health Commissi5on and the Hubei provincial government. The National Health Commission and the Hubei government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Thailand reported two cases of the coronavirus from Chinese travellers from Wuhan this week, while Japan confirmed one case involving a Japanese national who travelled to Wuhan. Memories remain fresh in Asia of a 2002/03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS.
Health officials say the new virus discovered in Wuhan does not appear to be as lethal as SARS but admit they still know little about it, including its origins or how easily it can be transmitted from person to person.
A seafood market in Wuhan is believed to be the epicentre, but authorities say some patients they have identified deny having any exposure to this market.
U.S. authorities have said they would start screening at three airports to detect travellers arriving via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan who may have symptoms of the new virus.
In Asia, authorities in Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand have stepped up monitoring of passengers from Wuhan at airports. Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines say they have strengthened screening at all points of entry in response to the outbreak, as well.
Japan screens all incoming travellers for high temperatures and started displaying notices at airports around the country asking passengers to come forward if they have travelled to Wuhan and have become sick.
Australia, which saw about 1.4 million short-term arrivals from China last year, is not planning any special screenings for now.
The WHO has said it advises against any travel or trade restrictions on China.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/edgar-allan-poe-house-in-baltimore-named-literary-landmark/,"BALTIMORE: A national association representing libraries is honouring the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum in Baltimore.

A division of the American Library Association has added the Poe house to its national registry of Literary Landmarks. The museum will host a dedication ceremony on Sunday, which coincides with the celebration of the 211th anniversary of Poe’s birth.
The house is the first literary site in Maryland to be included in the registry, the organization said. Previous dedications have included the homes of Tennessee Williams, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and William Faulkner.
The master of Gothic horror lived at the Baltimore house as an adult from 1833 to 1835. It became a museum in 1949 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971.
The museum says “MS. Found in a Bottle,” “Berenice” and “Morella” are among the stories Poe wrote at the landmark.

More areas off limits to development in next 5-year plan
Arrests for environment crimes on Yangtze in 2019 up 43% on year
China‘s overall water quality improved last year

BEIJING/SHANGHAI: China will impose more curbs on agriculture and widen restrictions on industrial development in the next five years in a bid to protect scarce, already contaminated water supplies from further pollution, a government official said on Friday.
The government is planning to restrict farming that encroaches on major rivers, restore wetlands and ecosystems and tackle excess water consumption in its 2021-2025 five-year plan, said Zhang Bo, head of the water department at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, speaking at a news briefing.
With per capita water resources only a quarter of the global average, China has made the restoration of contaminated supplies a priority. Zhang said the government would now take ecological value into consideration as well as economic value.

Beijing has been drawing what it calls “ecological protection red lines” that make areas off-limits to agriculture and industry. But with water demand still on the rise, it must strike a balance between bolstering economic growth, maximising agricultural output and protecting its rivers.
“Farmland that encroaches on the river is essentially not allowed to be there anyway,” Zhang told Reuters on the sidelines of the briefing in Beijing. “The drawing of ‘ecological protection red lines’ will take food security into consideration and strike that balance.”
China is in the middle of a campaign to restore the environment of the Yangtze river, which provides water to around 40% of the country’s population. The river has been damaged by decades of land reclamation, water diversion and the dumping of toxic waste.
Local governments have already been demolishing dams, relocating chemical plants, restoring wetlands and banning farming and fishing in ecologically sensitive areas, but some regions still fail to meet state water standards.
Earlier this week, China‘s top prosecution office said 7,084 people were arrested for environmental crimes on the Yangtze in 2019, up 43% on the year, with offences including illegal fishing and sand mining as well as the dumping of waste.
The environment ministry said water quality was improving overall, with 75% of surface water sampled at 1,940 sites across the country up to standard in 2019, up 3.9 percentage points compared to 2018.
China divides its water into six grades, with the first three considered safe for human use. The ministry said 3.4% remained “below grade V” – meaning it was unfit even for industrial or agricultural use – down 3.3 percentage points on the year.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/3-african-countries-trying-out-1st-malaria-vaccine-in-babies/,"TOMALI, MALAWI: A pinch in the leg, a squeal and a trickle of tears. One baby after another in Malawi is getting the first and only vaccine against malaria, one of history’s deadliest and most stubborn of diseases.
The southern African nation is rolling out the shots in an unusual pilot program along with Kenya and Ghana. Unlike established vaccines that offer near-complete protection, this new one is only about 40% effective. But experts say it’s worth a try as progress against malaria stalls: Resistance to treatment is growing and the global drop in cases has leveled off.
Health officials prepare to vaccine residents of the Malawi village of Migowi, where young children become test subjects for the world’s first vaccine against malaria,Tuesday, Dec 10, 2019. Photo: AP
With the vaccine, the hope is to help small children through the most dangerous period of their lives. Spread by mosquito bites, malaria kills more than 400,000 people every year, two-thirds of them under 5 and most in Africa.
Seven-month-old Charity Nangware received a shot on a rainy December day at a health clinic in the town of Migowi. She watched curiously as the needle slid into her thigh, then twisted up her face with a howl.
“I’m very excited about this,” said her mother, Esther Gonjani, who herself gets malaria’s aches, chills and fever at least once a year and loses a week of field work when one of her children is ill. “They explained it wasn’t perfect, but I feel secure it will relieve the pain.”
There is little escaping malaria — “malungo” in the local Chichewa language — especially during the five-month rainy season. Stagnant puddles, where mosquitoes breed, surround the homes of brick and thatch and line the dirt roads through tea plantations or fields of maize and sugar cane.
In the village of Tomali, the nearest health clinic is a two-hour bike ride away. The longer it takes to get care, the more dangerous malaria can be. Teams from the clinic offer basic medical care during visits once or twice a month, bringing the malaria shot and other vaccines in portable coolers.
Treating malaria takes up a good portion of their time during the rainy season, according to Daisy Chikonde, a local health worker.
“If this vaccine works, it will reduce the burden,” she said.
Resident Doriga Ephrem proudly said her 5-month-old daughter, Grace, didn’t cry when she got the malaria shot.
When she heard about the vaccine, Ephrem said her first thought was “protection is here.” Health workers explained, however, that the vaccine is not meant to replace antimalarial drugs or the insecticide-treated bed net she unfolds every night as the sun sets and mosquitoes rise from the shadows.
“We even take our evening meals inside the net to avoid mosquitoes,” she said.
It took three decades of research to develop the new vaccine, which works against the most common and deadly of the five parasite species that cause malaria. The parasite’s complex life cycle is a huge challenge. It changes forms in different stages of infection and is far harder to target than germs.
“We don’t have any vaccines against parasites in routine use. This is uncharted territory,” said Ashley Birkett, who directs PATH’s Malaria Vaccine Initiative, a nonprofit that helped drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline develop the shot, brand-named Mosquirix.
The bite of an infected mosquito sends immature parasites called sporozoites into the bloodstream. If they reach the liver, they’ll mature and multiply before spewing back into the blood to cause malaria’s debilitating symptoms. At that point, treatment requires medicines that kill the parasites.
Mosquirix uses a piece of the parasite — a protein found only on sporozoites’ surface — in hopes of blocking the liver stage of infection. When a vaccinated child is bitten, the immune system should recognize the parasite and start making antibodies against it.
Scientists also are searching for next-generation alternatives. In the pipeline is an experimental vaccine made of whole malaria parasites dissected from mosquitoes’ salivary glands but weakened so they won’t make people sick. Sanaria Inc. has been testing its vaccine in adults, and is planning a large, late-stage study in Equatorial Guinea’s Bioko Island.
And the U.S. National Institutes of Health soon will start initial tests of whether injecting people periodically with lab-made antibodies, rather than depending on the immune system to make them, could offer temporary protection during malaria season. Think of them as “potentially short-term vaccines,” NIH’s Dr. Robert Seder told a recent meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
For now, only babies in parts of Malawi, Kenya and Ghana are eligible for the Mosquirix vaccine. After the vaccine was approved in 2015, the World Health Organization said it first wanted a pilot roll-out to see how well it worked in a few countries — in real-world conditions — before recommending that the vaccine be given more widely across Africa.
“Everyone is looking forward to getting it,” said Temwa Mzengeza, who oversees Malawi’s vaccine programs. Those eager for the shots include her husband, whom she had to stop from trying to get them, she said.
Mzengeza used to come down with malaria several times a year until she started following her own advice to sleep under a net every night. Unlike many other kinds of infections, people can get malaria repeatedly, building up only a partial immunity.
In the pilot program that began last year, 360,000 children in the three countries are meant to be vaccinated annually. The first dose is given at about age 5 months and the final, fourth booster near the child’s second birthday.
Experts say it is too early to know how well the vaccine is working. They’re watching for malaria deaths, severe infections and cases of meningitis, something reported during studies but not definitively linked to the vaccine.
“To do something completely new for malaria is exciting,” said researcher Don Mathanga, who is leading the evaluation in Malawi.
The rainy season has brought new challenges, making some rural roads impassable and complicating efforts to track down children due for a shot. So far in Malawi, the first dose reached about half of the children targeted, about 35,000. That dropped to 26,000 for the second dose and 20,000 for the third.
That’s not surprising for a new vaccine, Mzengeza said. “It will pick up with time.”
At the health clinic in Migowi in Malawi’s southern highlands, workers see signs of hope. Henry Kadzuwa explains the vaccine to mothers waiting at the clinic. He said there was a drop in malaria cases to 40 in the first five months of the program, compared to 78 in the same period in 2018.
Even though he wishes his 3-year-old daughter, Angel, could receive the vaccine, “it’s protecting my community. It also makes my work easier,” Kadzuwa said. The Migowi area has one of the country’s highest rates of malaria, and a worn paper register in the clinic’s laboratory lists scores of cases.
At the clinic, Agnes Ngubale said she had malaria several years ago and wants to protect her 6-month-old daughter, Lydia, from the disease.
“I want her to be healthy and free,” she said. “I want her to be a doctor.”
And she has memorized the time for Lydia’s second dose: “Next month, same date.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australia-firefighters-save-worlds-only-rare-dinosaur-trees/,"CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA: Specialist firefighters have saved the world’s last remaining wild stand of a prehistoric tree from wildfires that razed forests west of Sydney, officials said Thursday.
Firefighters winched from helicopters to reach the cluster of fewer than 200 Wollemi Pines in a remote gorge in the Blue Mountains a week before a massive wildlife bore down, National Parks and Wildlife Service Director David Crust said.

The firefighters set up an irrigation system to keep the so-called dinosaur trees moist and pumped water daily from the gorge as the blaze that had burned out of control for more than two month edged closer.
Firefighting planes strategically bombed the fire front with fire retardant to slow its progress.
“That helped just to slow the intensity of the fire as it approached the site,” Crust told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
“The Wollemi Pine is a particularly important species and the fact that this is the only place in the world where they exist and they exist in such small numbers is really significant,” he added.
New South Wales state Environment Minister Matt Kean said the operation had saved the stand, although some plants had been singed.
“These pines outlived the dinosaurs, so when we saw the fire approaching we realized we had to do everything we could to save them,” Kean said.
The Wollemi Pine had only been seen in its fossilized form and was thought long extinct before the stand was found in 1994.
The fire that threatened it was brought under control this week after razing more than 510,000 hectares (1.26 million acres). The fire also destroyed 90% of the 5,000-hectare (12,400-acre) Wollemi National Park, where the rare trees grow, Crust said.
The exact location of the stand remains a closely guarded secret to help authorities protect the trees.
The Wollemi’s survival is one of the few positive stories to emerge from the unprecedented wildlife crisis in southeast Australia.
The fires have claimed at least 28 lives since September, destroyed more than 2,600 homes and razed more than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 million acres), mostly in New South Wales state. The area burned is larger than the U.S. state of Indiana.
But the fire danger has been diminished by rain this week in several areas. The first green buds of regrowth have already emerged in some blacked forests following rain.

Senior leader of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) Madhav Kumar Nepal today said he was not involved in Lalita Niwas land-grab scam.
Talking to mediapersons at Biratnagar airport, Nepal said the allegation levelled against him was false and he was ready to face punishment if found guilty. He said the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority had not indicted NC Vice-president Bijay Kumar Gachhadar for political reason.
“I do not think that anyone has been indicted in the land-grab scam out of political prejudice,” Nepal said. “The guilty should not go scot-free while the innocent should not be indicted,” Nepal said, adding, “I am against corruption and do not allow others to be corrupt.”
He argued that the government and opposition should not interfere with the CIAA’s jurisdictions.
The CIAA has indicted 175 people, including NC Vice-president Bijay Kumar Gachhadar, in Baluwatar land-grab scam.
The main opposition Nepali Congress has protested Gachhadar’s indictment saying the government had shielded its leaders and influenced the CIAA to carry out political vendetta.
Nepal also said the House of Representatives should approve the grant offered by the United States of America under Millennium Challenge Corporation compact.
Stating that MCC was not a part of the Indo-Pacific strategy, Nepal stressed on the need to rectify MCC compact by the Federal Parliament.

Protesting indictment of its leader Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar in Baluwatar land-grab case, the main opposition Nepali Congress obstructed the House of Representatives proceedings for the second day today.
The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority had on Wednesday filed corruption case against 175 individuals, including the NC’s vice-president and parliamentary party deputy leader Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar for their role in transferring government-owned land in Lalita Niwas, Baluwatar, in individuals’ names.
The NC is of the view that the government influenced the CIAA to carry out political vendetta.

Just as Speaker Agni Sapkota announced commencement of the House proceedings today, NC lawmakers stood up from their seats. The speaker then allowed NC lawmaker Min Bahadur Bishwakarma to speak.
Bishwakarma reiterated NC’s position that the government had deliberately framed Gachchhadar, giving clean chit to those who were actually involved in the scam. He also said the government had rendered the CIAA its shadow to selectively slap false cases against NC members.
Bishwakarma said Gachchhadar, former minister of physical infrastructure and transport was indicted on the basis of the proposal he had tabled in the Cabinet, which validated transfer of government-owned land at Baluwatar in the names of
individuals.
“However, former prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, who presided over the Cabinet meeting that approved Gachchhadar’s proposal, has been given clean chit,” he said. “This suggests the government’s mala fide intention.”
After the NC lawmakers continued their protest, Speaker Sapkota postponed the HoR meeting for 30 minutes. As the NC lawmakers did not budge, Sapkota adjourned the HoR meeting until Sunday.
NC’s student wing, Nepal Students Union today staged demonstration at Maitighar Mandala to protest Gachchhadar’s indictment. The students said Gachchhadar’s indictment was premeditated.
NSU President Rajeev Dhungana said the CIAA, acting at the behest of the government, protected the ruling party members and indicted NC leaders with the intention to defame his party.
“It is ridiculous that the CIAA has indicted a minister for tabling the proposal and protected the prime minister who approved it,” he said.
The Parliament Secretariat today informed that Gachchhadar has been suspended as the member of the House of Representatives. As per the Prevention of Corruption Act— 2002, lawmakers are automatically suspended from their posts after the filing of charge-sheet against them on corruption charges.

Nepalis living in the Chinese province of Hubei, the epicentre of novel coronavirus outbreak, have started making frantic requests to the government to evacuate them at the earliest, as more and more people are dying or getting infected by the disease in China.
The government formally initiated the process of evacuating its citizens from China last week when Nepali Embassy in Beijing called on Nepalis living in Hubei to submit applications if they wished to return home. On Sunday 180 students, including three children, had filed applications. But since then the government has not done much to evacuate them, while the condition of Nepalis in China is worsening.

“We are now forced to use tap water because there is lack of drinking water in the hostel. There is also shortage of food, including vegetables. And the college has been providing same type of food for days and it doesn’t taste good,” said Dr Gaurab Pokhrel, a PhD candidate at Tongji Medical Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
Worse, students like Pokhrel have been confined to their rooms for days while students of many other countries have already been evacuated. “Life has come to a halt,” said Pokhrel, who a few days ago had told THT that he did not want to return to Nepal. “And all the while the number of coronavirus cases is rising. We don’t know till when we can save ourselves,” he added.
The Embassy of Nepal in China also confirmed that many students in China were facing mental stress. “Those who were behaving normally earlier and were counselling others too are panicking,” said Sushil Lamsal, deputy chief of mission, Embassy of Nepal in China.
The guardians of Nepali students in China today visited Minister of Foreign Affairs Pradeep Gyawali and requested him to confirm the evacuation date. But the minister could not make any commitment. He only said the work was in process, according to a ministry source.
“If the state cannot evacuate us then it should clearly say so,” said Pokhrel, adding, “This is an emergency situation and the government should work swiftly in the crisis situation.”
Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli yesterday directed the line agencies to bring Nepalis back from China and quarantine them at four places in Kathmandu valley — Shivapuri, Surya Binayak, Ichangu Narayan and Kharipati.
“So far, the location to quarantine China returnees has not been finalised,” said Mahendra Shrestha, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health and Population, who passed the buck on evacuation of Nepalis to the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation.
“It is the civil aviation ministry’s job to bring back Nepalis. The health ministry will only look into the health of Nepalis returning from China,” said Shrestha.
According to sources, Nepal has not been able to bring its citizens back from China as the government is yet to meet the World Health Organisation’s standard on evacuation.
“The evacuation process has been delayed because most of the infrastructure is still not in place,” said a source.
Health experts have been saying that there should be a proper place to quarantine China returnees. Also, there should be isolation wards in hospitals and health workers should be available round the clock.
“We need to adhere to international standards before evacuating our people. It will take a few more days. We also need to train crew members who will bring back our people,” the source said.
The novel coronavirus has killed at least 636 in China and one each in Hong Kong and the Philippines. At least 25 countries have confirmed cases of coronavirus.

*Rank out of 195 countries




 
Although GHSI ranking puts Nepal in the league of nations that are ‘more prepared’ to maintain health security, the country lags behind in ‘detection and reporting’ category. Nepal ranks 150th in this category with a score of 22, which is much lower than the global average of 41.9, states the GHSI, which was published in October. This implies Nepal’s laboratory systems, real-time surveillance and reporting, epidemiology workforce and data integration among human/animal/environmental health sectors are not robust.
Another area where Nepal lags behind is ‘compliance with international norms’, as per GHSI. Nepal ranks 167th among 195 countries in this category with a score of 33.5, which is lower than the global average of 48.5. This indicates Nepal needs to enhance reporting compliance, fulfil international commitments and share genetic and biological data and specimens more frequently.

A day after the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority indicted Nepali Congress leader Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar in Baluwatar land-grab scam, the main opposition party today obstructed the House of Representatives proceedings, stating the government influenced the CIAA to carry out political vendetta.
The anti-graft body yesterday filed corruption case against 175 individuals and organisations, including the NC’s vice-president and parliamentary party deputy leader Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, for their role in transferring government-owned land in Lalita Niwas, Baluwatar, in individuals’ names.
Just as Speaker Agni Sapkota announced commencement of the House proceedings today, NC lawmakers stood up from their seats. The speaker then allowed NC Whip Pushpa Bhusal to speak.
Bhusal began her speech lamenting that credibility of the CIAA, an independent constitutional body, had been eroded. “Can the CIAA act to carry out political vendetta?” she questioned. “This is not a democratic practice.”
According to Bhusal, Gachhadar, former minister of physical infrastructure and transport, has been indicted on the basis of a proposal that he tabled in the Cabinet which validated transfer of government-owned land at Baluwatar in the names of individuals.
“However, the then prime minister, Madhav Kumar Nepal, who presided over the Cabinet meeting that approved Gachhadar’s proposal, has been given the clean chit,” she said. “It was not Gachhadar’s decision, but the Cabinet’s decision. If the PM does not want, no proposal can be tabled in the Cabinet, let alone its endorsement.”
Bhusal argued that the government influenced the CIAA to carry out political vendetta against opposition leaders and let off leaders of the ruling party.
Pointing out that the CIAA let off NCP General Secretary Bishnu Paudel’s son Navin in the Lalita Niwas land-grab scam as he agreed to return the plot, Bhusal said no law in the country had such a provision. “Can a person be given the clean chit just because s/he returns illegally-acquired property?” Bhusal questioned. “This forces us to raise questions over the CIAA’s credibility.”
At the end of her presentation, Bhusal said her party would not cooperate in the commencement of the House proceedings and all the NC lawmakers stood up from their seats. Speaker Sapkota then adjourned the House till 1:00pm tomorrow.
Meanwhile, the NC held a meeting of its incumbent and former office bearers at NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba’s residence this morning. The meeting concluded that Gachhadar’s indictment was guided by prejudice and mala fide intention.
“The conclusion was based on series of events where NC members have been slapped with false cases to demoralise them,” NC Spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma said at a press meet this afternoon.
Sharma added that the CIAA’s move not to file case against Bishnu Paudel’s son Nabin Paudel and indict others in a similar case suggested the decision was influenced by the government. He also questioned why former prime ministers Madhav Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai, who presided over Cabinet meetings approving Baluwatar land sale, were not indicted.
When asked what would be his party’s next move, Sharma said the party was holding meetings with its sister and friendly organisations to devise a plan. He, however, said his party and Gachhadar would respect the court and tackle the case both legally and politically.
Meanwhile, the NC’s student wing has planned to hold a demonstration at Maitighar Mandala tomorrow afternoon to protest Gachhadar’s indictment.

Ghorahi, February 5
People of Ghorahi had been time and again urging the authorities concerned to check the air and sound pollution caused by the Ghorahi Cement Industry located in Ghorahi Municipality-4.
But their concern have so far fallen on deaf ears and the locals are now starting a protest movement against the pollution caused by the dust, smoke and sound from the factory.
Troubled by the heavy dust, smoke and sound coming from the factory, the locals have launched an agitation by forming a Factory-affected Environment Protection and Concerned Committee. The committee has relentlessly calling for controlling pollution caused by the factory in their area for the last six years.
Dil Bahadur Gharti, a resident of Laxmipur, Ghorahi-4, lamented that the situation was such that it had become difficult to grow crops and vegetables due to the heavy dust cover in the area. “We cannot even consume the vegetables we grow in the kitchen garden. There is thick layer of dust on the vegetables and leaves. We used to grow a lot of fruits and vegetables in our village before, but these days fruits like litchi, lemon, mango and others wilt away and the fruits start dropping,’ he said, explaining the adverse situation caused by the heavy dust pollution.
Govinda Acharya, member of the committee whose house is close to the factory, said they could not even sleep at night due to the noise from the factory. “The factory operates 24 hours and the noise and dust pollution level is high at night,” he added.
“We have requested the factory management to stop the noise for at least six hours at night. But they have been neglecting our concerns. It is difficult to even breathe due to the dust and smoke pollution.
Ghorahi Cement Industries Pvt Ltd has, however, insisted that the factory has conformed with the standards set by the government. The cement factory that had produced 1,200 metric tonnes of cement every day during its establishment period has now started producing 2,000 metric tonnes of cement every day.  The factory has now been producing and sending its products to the market in the name of ‘Sagarmatha Cement’.
Chairperson of Dandagaun Secondary School Management Committee, Tanka Sunar, said that different problems like body itching, cold and cough had
become common among students after establishment of the factory. The school is located near the factory.
Public Administration Chief of the cement factory, Bikas Sharma, mentioned that the factory was abiding by the criteria determined by the government. Sharma said the factory has not only been producing cement,but also providing employment to locals as per their skill and capacity. He also said efforts were being made to control environment pollution by planting saplings.
He said, “We have not been carrying out any activities that have negative impacts on anyone. A study can be carried out by bringing experts from the centre if you feel there is some problem regarding operation of the factory. The factory is in operation in the right way.”
The industry’s public administration chief Sharma said the target to increase production capacity of the industry to 4,000 metric tonnes daily and work has begun for the same after acquiring  permission from the government.
Ghorahi sub-metropolis Mayor Narulal Chaudhary said practical aspects should be taken into account while operating business even though all the legal procedures have been carried out.
He was of the view that it was necessary to take the locals’ concerns seriously. According to him, none desired to see the closure of the industry, but the voices were for making it citizen-friendly. It is essential to be sensitive towards the minimisation of negative consequences of the industry.
Chief District Officer Govinda Prasad Rijal said the factory had been instructed to find measures for the safe release and management of smoke, dust and sound pollution bearing in mind the people’s complaints.
The factory claims that several efforts are being made to minimise environmental impacts and pollution-control equipment has been installed.

The Beechcraft 1900D of Buddha Air touched down at Biratnagar airport at 1:00 pm on Monday. It was not a usual flight of the private carrier. It was a maiden direct flight from Pokhara to Biratnagar.
The 18-seater aircraft was carrying 17 commercial passengers in its 65-minute flight from the capital city of Gandaki Province to the capital city of Province 1.
The aircraft made its return flight at 1:10pm carrying 17 passengers on board. According to Kausal Bhandari, Biratnagar Station Manager of Buddha Air, there will be three flights a week from Biratnagar to Pokhara.
‘’We have scheduled our two-way flights on Monday, Wednesday and Friday’’, informed Bhandari. The airline has fixed its airfare at Rs 6,200 for the 205 nautical mile air travel.
Direct air connectivity between the two provincial headquarters has energised tourism entrepreneurs of Province 1.
Bhabish Shrestha, a tourism entrepreneur in Biratnagar, said air connectivity has increased hope of attracting third country tourists from Pokhara. ‘’Pokhara is a touristic hotspot of Nepal and Province 1 is tourist-hungry with numerous tourism treasures’’, said Shrestha, also a member of Tourism Promotion Committee of Province 1 for Visit Nepal 2020.  “Direct air connectivity will make it easier for third country tourists to land in Province 1,” he added.
Alina Magar, a tourism entrepreneur of Dharan, is also optimistic about direct air connectivity. ‘’Previously, we had only land connectivity and it was hard to travel to and from Pokhara and Biratnagar for high-end tourists with hectic schedules,’’ said Magar. “This direct flight has given an option for direct air mobility,’’ she added.
Bordered by populous Indian provinces of Bihar and West Bengal, Province 1 doesn’t see many third country tourists. With the beginning of budgetary direct air connectivity with what many call Nepal’s ‘tourism capital city’ Pokhara, tourism professionals of Province 1 are excited.
‘’Pokhara is in need of Indian tourists from the neighbouring Indian states of Sikkim, Bihar and West Bengal and Province 1 is in need of third country tourists arriving in Pokhara’,’ said Krishna Shah, a noted tourism activist and also the member of the Tourism Promotion Committee of Province 1 for Visit Nepal 2020.

As many as 12 Dalit Musahar families have been left in a lurch after their houses were pulled down at Belhi Chapena of Rajgadh Rural Municiplaity, Saptari, four days ago.
Though their houses were demolished four days ago, Musahar families are yet to be relocated. Musahar families’ houses were demolished following the January 28 directive of Saptari District Court. The court had issued a diktat in a case filed by a local, Ram Bahadur Mandal, stating that the land occupied by Dalit families belonged to him.

Musahar people said  since their houses were demolished without prior notice they could not even take out food items and grains. More than 100 Dalits are living in makeshift tents in the area. They are having a hard time making ends meet.
Kari Sada complained that their pleas to the local government and the DAO had fallen on deaf ears. “We submitted a memorandum to the CDO, but no help has come so far,” he said, adding, “Government negligence has aggravated our plight.”
Meanwhile, rural municipality Chairman Parmanand Yadav said that efforts were under way to manage shelter for the Musahar families. “We are looking for land to relocate them,” he said, adding that they would find the land in a few days and manage the displaced families.

The fifth session of the Provincial Assembly of State 1 is beginning tomorrow afternoon. This session has been much-anticipated as it is finalising the name of the province 1 and its permanent headquarters after two years.
Biratnagar was declared the temporary capital of Province 1 on 6 May 2019. Since then the name of the state and its capital has not been put to discussion in the Provincial Assembly sessions.
This session, however, as said by Chief Minister of the State Sherdhan Rai in his repeated public speeches, will give a formal name to the state and its headquarters.
Though not discussed formally in the Provincial Assembly, at least half-a-dozen names are at play in various political and civilian discourses in the province. These names are from various fronts. Those, liking geographical landmarks as the name of state, have proposed Koshi, the biggest river of Nepal that flows in the province, and Sagarmatha, the highest peak of the planet Mt. Everest, as the name of the province.
Likewise, political parties and civilians, who are in favour of identity, have floated some other names for the province. ‘Kirat’, ‘Limbuwan Kirat’ and ‘Bijayapur’ — names associated with identity politics.
Some have also talked about mixed model in naming the province. Combined name including geographical landmark and cultural identity has been put forth by some members of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP). Sarbadhwaj Sanba, the Provincial Assembly member belonging to NPC said that Kirat-Limbuwan-Koshi can be a name of the mixed model.
Koshi is the ‘most probable’ name
Based on already declared names on the four provinces ruled by the NCP and some public remarks by senior leaders, it is likely that either Koshi or Sagarmatha will be the name of Province 1.
Names of states such as Karnali, Gandaki, Sudurpaschim, Bagmati are mainly based on landmarks. In a similar way, Province 1, as said by many NCP leaders, is likely to be named on the basis of landmarks such as Koshi and Sagarmatha.
Senior leader of NCP  Madhav Kumar Nepal had already proposed this name in formal forums. Nepal had proposed to name ‘Koshi’ at a programme organised by NCP Itahari on 26 October 2019.
“How long should we wait to call your province by a name?’’ Nepal had questioned Province 1 government. He added, “Go ahead with the name Koshi.’’
“Koshi is the most probable name because it has the backing both from ruling and the main opposition parties,’’ said an influential NCP leader of Province 1 on condition of anonymity.
According to the constitutional provision, two-thirds majority of the Provincial Assembly can give a permanent name to the state.
Currently, the ruling NCP has more than two-thirds seats in the 93-member Provincial Assembly. NCP has 67 members in the Provincial Assembly.
The main opposition Nepali Congress has 21 seats and Socialist Party-Nepal has three seats. Likewise, Rastriya Pajatantra Party and Limbuwan have one member each in the Provincial Assembly.

Rautahat police nabbed two persons, including a woman for swindling the locals of Rautahat district yesterday.
Police took Bhup Narayan Yadav, an information technology officer working at Garuda Municipality Office and China Koirala of Chandrapur Municipality-6 under control on the basis of two separate cases filed against them by the victims at Rautahat District Police Office.
Yadav and China have been remanded to seven-day police custody. The court, however, has issued a directive to the police to produce China before the court within 24 hours after her relative registered a habeas corpus application.
Jayanath Yadav of Gethahiguthi, Garuda Municipality, and national council member of Samajwadi Party-Nepal had helped pass three kathha land worth Rs 15 million owned by Sekh Kadir in the name of Bhup Narayan, pledging to send his son to Australia one-and-a-half years ago.
Kadir complained that he neither got his land back nor was his son sent to Australia.
Kadir had agreed to transfer his three kathha land in Bhup Narayan’s name as he did not have cash to send his son to Australia.
However, Bhup Narayan had sold the three kathha land to Sajila Begam Prabin of Gamhariya Gadda Municiplaity-2 around a year ago. Kadir had then filed a case against Bhup Narayan saying that he was swindled.
Police had nabbed China from her home after eight persons, including Harimaya Basnet, Sita Kuswar and Gita Kumari Rai registered a joint compliant with the police against eight persons, including China, for swindling millions from them.
“A manhunt to nab other accused persons is under way,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Nabin Karki. The joint case states that eight persons, including China, had given loan to locals at meter interest and swindled millions from them.
DSP Karki said a search operation was on to nab the absconding people, including Samajwadi Party-Nepal leader Yadav.

Kathmandu, February 5
A  member of the National Assembly has drawn the attention of the government to poor implementation of the existing law, which ensures 50 per cent discount for senior citizens in public transport.
Speaking at the zero hour of the Upper House today, lawmaker Udaya Sharma Poudel said senior citizens were deprived of the facility. “Public vehicles plying the valley road and other long route buses have been denying the facility of 50 per cent discount to the senior citizens,” she said. The Procedure for Senior Citizens in Public Transport-2014, states that a senior citizen shall be entitled to 50 per cent discount in bus, minibus and micro-bus on the basis of ID card indicating his or her age.
Poudel also raised the issue of seats to be reserved for women, senior citizens and differently-abled persons. “Public vehicles doesn’t abide by seat quota reserved for the rightful persons. I would like to urge the authorities concerned to implement the law in an effective manner through monitoring,” she said.
The government has already implemented the Senior Citizen Identity Card Directive to provide senior citizens with protection and social security under the constitution.
As per the directive, the government will issue ID cards to senior citizens through local levels. Any person above 60 years of age may submit an application to the concerned local level for ID card.
Senior citizens comprise 2.2 million of the total population of the country. Senior citizens get 50 per cent discount in public transport and government hospitals on the basis of ID card.

The Motor Vehicle and Transport Management Act-2019, enacted by the municipal assembly of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, states that any passenger, who occupies a seat reserved for women, senior citizens and differently-abled persons shall be liable to a fine of Rs 1,000 for the first instance and Rs 2,000 from the second time onwards.
There is a provision of  nine-member monitoring committee led by a member of the municipal executive, designated by KMC mayor to carry out monitoring of transport management in Kathmandu and impose fine on rule violators.
The committee also includes representatives from traffic police, city police, organisations working for the rights of consumers and transport entrepreneurs. If any company or organisation violates transport rules, its registration may be revoked, according to the act. However, many of the provisions have yet to be implemented.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/bank-as-broker-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/,"Although commercial banks have a larger network across the country, they cannot operate the brokerage business with their existing branches. Thus, the question arises, are banks willing to establish such subsidiary companies outside Kathmandu? 
Nepal Bankers’ Association (NBA), an independent group of commercial banks, has been trying to coax Nepal Rastra Bank to provide commercial banks with the license of a stock broker. The Ministry of Finance has already directed the Security Board of Nepal (SEBON), and SEBON to the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) to initiate the process. The banking institutions are required to establish one sister organisation (subsidiary company) to perform this job. In this race, some A class commercial banks have already started opening subsidiary firms. Thus, beneath the surface, the tectonic plates of share trading are shifting. And this has not gone down well with the existing brokers and the lawmakers. The issue is now under discussion with the Economic Committee in the House of Representatives.

The brokerage firms are arguing that giving licenses to banks, major players in the capital market, will promote a yet more important anomaly in the stock market – information asymmetry, as availability of internal information about the parent company – the bank – could lead to an increase in defrauding small investors and the public. But the NBA argues that a larger network, throughout the country, of banks will help the stock market gain momentum.
The Economic Committee has issued a note to stop the process for the time being until the pros and cons of issuing broker licenses to banking institutions become clearer.
Let’s first understand the constituents of NEPSE.
Banking institutions are the big dogs of the Nepali financial market, accounting for more than 60 per cent of the total market capitalisation. The insurance companies come second, with a market share of about 16 per cent. The remaining 24 per cent encompasses hydro, manufacturing, hotels, trading and other industries. According to NEPSE, there are 50 licensed brokers who facilitate share trading in Nepal.
Their transactions are largely domiciled in the Kathmandu Valley, barring a few who provide services from outside.
In fact, the Nepali capital market is Kathmandu-centric.
This is where banking institutions will give NEPSE the much-needed impetus with their wide network, becoming a conduit between rural Nepal and the capital market. Granting banks access to trading in the stock exchange will not only help expand its wings in the rural areas, but also make it more efficient with their huge capital base.
These organisations in comparison to the existing brokers can easily sustain themselves during an economic downturn. Similarly, banking institutions that are responsible for deposit collection and loan disbursement could enhance the margin of trading, a timidly practised phenomenon in NEPSE, with their easy access to loans for share trading. Besides, what is important is the tight regulations that banking institutions operate under the supervision of the central bank. This will further increase transparency in share trading.
From the technological aspect, banking institutions could make large investments in trading technologies, such as appbased trading, online selfmade trading, and iterative applications for investors’ analysis.
However, as a major player in the Nepali financial system, the commercial banking industry once in a while makes headlines for promoting cartelling and syndicates in interest rate setting and other activities in the market.
Such misconduct is what makes stakeholders to question the bank’s role as stockbroker. The NBA had prevented NIC Asia Bank from increasing its fixed deposit rates under the free market practices by surpassing NRB’s guidelines.
Other businesses of a similar nature and frequent interbank lendings are enough to heap distrust on the banks.
Thus, the chances of information asymmetry in the market are high. Once such institutions that outperform the number of shares of other companies from trading frequencies in NEPSE – out of the top 10 traders by number in the last year, eight were commercial banks – hold grip on the stock market, market imperfections cannot be ignored. This will lead to market upheavals. Especially, during the time of down-turn, to create market demand and push the industry’s share prices up, banks as broker could play a role in enticing small and naive investors to engage in misconduct.
So the issue is not about whether banks should be allowed to do this business, rather it is about whether the authorities have sufficient policies to control probable misconduct. Because, given the status quo of the Nepali capital market, banking institutions are the only institutions that could reshape the stock market’s landscape.
More specifically, the issue is about the expansion of the existing market. Therefore, the regularity bodies must ensure that banking institutions will not renege on expanding brokerage services throughout Nepal.
The point is that though banks have a larger network, they cannot operate this business with their existing branches. Thus, the question arises, are banks willing to establish such subsidiary companies outside the Valley? If not, it will create nothing but a mismanaged heap of brokers in the Kathmandu Valley.
Likewise, attention should be paid to the issue of information asymmetry and unhealthy competition.
Otherwise, the huge capital base of banks will oust the existing brokers from the business.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-questions-galore/,"The CIAA has filed a corruption case against 175 persons in the Lalita Niwas scandal, but has given political protection to a few 
A constitutional body like the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) is supposed to conduct its investigation on corruption impartially.
Its probe should be widely acceptable to the public. The anti-graft body should not be seen as acting as a tool of the ruling party or the people in power, out to take political revenge on rival political parties by dragging them into corruption cases to ruin their political and social career once and for all.
The manner in which the CIAA filed a corruption caseagainst 175 individuals, including former deputy prime minister and vice president of the Nepali Congress Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, on Wednesday, for their roles in the Lalita Niwas land grab case shows the charge-sheet was motivated by political vendetta.
Gachhadar was minister for Physical Planning and Construction nine years ago in Madhav Kumar Nepal’s cabinet, which decided to expand the PM’s residence and build a road inside Lalita Niwas by providing compensation to the landowners who had captured the land illegally on the basis of the government decisions taken on May 28 and May 31 and on July 23, 1990.
In fact, the then cabinet in 1990 had decided to return the land – only 14 ropanis – confiscated during the Panchayat regime on political grounds. Following this decision, the politicians, bureaucrats and land mafia, however, forged a nexus among them and misinterpreted the then cabinet decisions and managed to register 112 ropanis of land in their names, out of the total 299 ropanis land of Lalita Niwas duly obtained by the government through the Land Acquisition Act, 1961. However, the Sarada Prasad Trital-led probe panel found that the land was illegally grabbed by those people levelled in the CIAA chargesheet at the Special Court.
Undoubtedly corruption is rife in the country. This is not possible without the nexus of politicians, bureaucrats and land sharks, all of whom have become millionaires without known sources of income. The action taken by the CIAA is welcome. But the question here is: Why did the CIAA act so selectively? Why did it not file a charge-sheet against Navin Poudel, the son of Bishnu Poudel, general-secretary of the ruling NCP, and Supreme Court Justice Kumar Regmi, both of whom had also bought plots of land there? The CIAA’s claim that it did not deem necessary to file a case against them as they had “declared before that they were ready to return the land to the government” is no more than a knee-jerk response, only to give them political protection, perhaps at the Prime Minister’s behest. Will others facing the corruption charges get a clean-chit if they also do the same as Poudel and Regmi have done? There has been no convincing explanation as to why “policy decisions” taken by former PMs Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai have not been scrutinised.
It was not necessary – in fact, it is unlawful – to take a policy decision when the laws already exist to deal with public land. An investigation carried out by a constitutional organ like the CIAA should be fair and impartial to every extent possible. It cannot allow itself to be used as a tool to settle politcal scores, or else it will only hurt CIAA’s credibility.

Seeds of dismay
It’s easy to cheat the Nepalis and get away with it, especially if they are poor farmers. A host of sugar mills have not paid the farmers for years for the sugarcane they bought to produce sugar. While the mill owners keep postponing and postponing payments to the farmers, the latter are at the receiving end as they have to clear the loans they took from the banks or moneylender. A similar fate is shared by the farmers who sowed the Garima paddy seeds that yielded nothing. It’s been months since the government gave assurances to the farmers that they would be compensated, either by the government or by the company that produced the paddy seeds.
The lingering compensation process is eroding the patience of the farmers. Have the concerned authorities held the agent who imported the Garima paddy seeds for questioning or has he closed shop and fled, as it normally happens in such cases? Whether it’s sugarcane, paddy or other farmers, the government cannot afford to let them down if we are to engage them to grow sufficient food for the country. At a time when the rural areas are being emptied of their youths, the only way to ensure that our lands remain cultivated is to keep our farmers happy.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/digitally-disabled/,"I realised the depth of my dependency upon the Internet and digital gadgets after my smart-phone went defunct.
First, the mobile came as a magic device that connected me to people through voices. It was for this function that people started carrying mobiles.
Slowly and gradually, the mobile phone largely displaced watches, calculators, calendars, dictionaries, and what not. Because the mobile became a package of everything, and after the app developers came mushrooming in, virtually nothing seemed impossible through taps and swipes. The Internet sublimely supplemented smart phones in their splendour.
Instead of using my own brain, I unknowingly shifted the memory storage to the mobile phone. I could very clearly remember the phone numbers of at least ten people close to me when there was no mobile.
Now, I try very hard but can’t recall the phone numbers of anyone except my own. When I go shopping in a grocery store, while paying the bills, I have to take out my mobile to open its calculator. I make plans about my apparel and day routine according to the weather forecast displayed on my phone. When I am alone, I play music, word puzzles and online games.
When I have friends, I play ludos or PUBG in group. So, lonely or not, a mobile always comes handy.
It’s been years since I stopped watching television. It is because YouTube has dynamic features that I can play any time on my mobile. I don’t have to always sit in front of the television screen kept in the living room. I can watch it while riding a bus or in leisure classes with my friends. Since a single tap gets you to be audio-visually connected with your cousin living in London, no one feels forlorn and away. Come morning, and you just download the e-papers to read the dailies with a digital swipe.
You want to dine in a nice eatery or cook a new cuisine, just ask Google Assistant or Shiri.
The mobile has entered the house of humanity like a combo machine that can perform everything from scanner to editor, listener to speaker, recorder to camera, spy to flashlight, so forth and so on.
Yes, life is easy when I have a phone. And I can’t live even a single day without it now. Was it a self-felt need or was it coerce-fully laden into my life even if I didn’t need it? Or, in some way I think, I started to carry a mobile before I needed it, and without it life is all dark in FOMO.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/private-schools-public-questions/,"The learning environment in most private schools is lamentable. Congested space and unscientific and jerry-built buildings – unlikely to resist a likely catastrophic situation or predictable pitfalls – are common
Education is the chief defence of a nation. As it heralds prosperity and success, every nation gives utmost priority to it. The developed countries have a sound educational system in place. They have 100 per cent literacy rate. Education’s impact on overall prosperity is evidently wide and without dispute. John Dewey’s book Democracy and Education deems education as the first and foremost priority of democracy. It is not without reason that Japan’s first government after World War II had earmarked 49 per cent of its budget for education. Nepal’s government too has allocated a good percentage of the budget on education, but it needs to go higher.

Realising that education is the cardinal beam and pillar for a nation’s progress, India introduced the student quality circle in education in the 1990s to “improve and enrich quality of education and enhance student life with varied and invigorating experiences.” Concurrently, the quest for quality education popularised the trend of private education in Nepal. Consequently, a large pool of private schools and colleges has mushroomed in the country. Today there are 20,000 plus private schools in the country.
But the new constitution has dragged private schools into controversy. Scholars argue that private schools should be phased out as education is the obligation of the nation. The contribution of private schools in reducing the government’s burden ought to be thanked. The advent of certain changes – especially, raising the efficiency of the English language among the students – should not be undermined. However, some of the concerns being raised are profoundly gruesome.
Fees levied by the private schools numb everyone’s nerves as they exceed more than half of one’s income. Latest reports sordidly graph parents spending Rs 7,000 a month per child, in aggregate, in a normal school. A few schools charge much higher. And then the unjustifiable fees under various headings, such as library, computer, swimming, excursion, music and others only enlarge the hardships. All these necessarily come within the ambit of the perceived ‘quality education’, for which the parents have already paid large sums. Thus, making extra charges is undisputedly illogical.
Moreover, the learning environment in most private schools is lamentable. Congested space, unscientific and jerry-built buildings – unlikely to resist a likely catastrophic situation or predictable pitfalls – are common. An acute shortage of spacious playgrounds, serene and tranquil location, a well-stocked library, plethora of extra-curricular activities and mandatory labs to allow students to explore their talents are evident to all. The quest for private education deepens the grotesque consumerism among the public. Sometimes, it drives people to indulge in unethical and illegal activities for financial management.
Government education is highly appreciated and accredited in many countries, including India. Even in Kathmandu, around two dozen government schools do better than renowned private schools. Private education is not synonymous with quality education, but an ineffective public education system has sent the wrong message to the people.
Private education has brought about serious, sometimes evidently sinful, degradation of our indigenous culture. Unfounded infatuation with western mores, religion and lifestyle has devastated our economy and health. Private schools have nurtured the tendency of promoting multinational products like soft drinks. The passion for junk food is taking a heavy toll on our children’s health. Boarding or residential schools pose a challenge to the values of family harmony.
Annually, about 10 per cent of the schools see changes in their founders, which impact the students’ psychology. Dichotomy between the founder and other members in the board is soaring. Overarching business followed by syndicated sale of all other logistics is converting founders into crony capitalists and corporate leaders. But, most working staff members receive a meagre salary and can’t even maintain the minimal life standards. Besides the poor salary, there is no provision of social security, gratuity, growth and training. Student unions see them as fertile grounds for seeking donations, and political leaders exploit them for providing free education to their offspring. This has allowed them to be unregulated and unmonitored.
On top of this dismay and turmoil, the goal of private schools is most abominable and objectionable. Almost 80 per cent of the students who go abroad for higher education are from private schools. Private education brainwashes pupils to head for a foreign nation. The use of our people as cheap and insensitive machines by the developed countries has aborted our development prospects. This has produced a poor international image, which is humiliating to us.
Besides being poorly managed, private education is damaging a significant quarter of society in many ways. Poor education costs a nation more than lack of education. Thus, it must be efficiently regulated and monitored for meeting the public concern. An encouraging prelude is a must. Any delay on it might trap us into a situation when we may not be in a position even to lament later.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-thumbs-up-to-nrb/,"NRB’s move should bring good revenue for the government as the social media generate large amounts of advertisements
The recent directive of Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, to have all transactions related to advertising on social media platforms made only through formal banking channels is highly welcome. It has come to light that several companies and agencies in Nepal are using informal channels, such as hundi and illegal cards, to make payments for social media advertisements to such platforms in foreign countries. Hundi is an informal channel for transferring money from one place to another. It is illegal in Nepal as it skips the banking channels and also does not follow the regulations of the central banks of world governments. NRB’s ruling is aimed at curbing capital flight in view of the growing trend of making payments from Nepal through the illegal channels for advertisements posted on social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube. Anyone found making payments outside the banking channels are to be booked under the Foreign Exchange Act, 2019, according to the announcement of the apex bank.
With nearly everyone having access to a mobile phone or a computer these days, advertising on the social media platforms has gained popularity in Nepal – as elsewhere. One has only to open a social networking site, and one is flooded by a stream of advertisements, at times almost to the point of annoyance. At any given time, millions of people, especially youths, are scrolling down a networking site, especially Facebook, and any advertisement posted there is sure to reach its target audience directly and quickly. However, quite unlike the traditional media, no one knows exactly how much money is spent on advertising on the social media platforms or how much money flows out of the country to pay for the advertisements. Since payments have to be made in foreign currency, there are high chances of it being misappropriated when informal channels are used.
Though belated, NRB’s move should help bring all transactions related to the advertisement business on the digital platform under the tax net. This should bring good revenue for the government as the social media generate large amounts of advertisements, may be even more than the traditional media. Definitely, the NRB’s directive will affect digital marketing, as some advertisers have already started whining about. But then it is very unfair when only the traditional media has to follow the government rules and regulations and pay taxes on the advertisements generated. It is necessary that all the companies and agencies using social media platforms
for advertising cooperate and follow the NRB’s latest directive. The government has the duty to not only stop capital flight but also learn from where and how the money that is being sent abroad is being generated. This is because there are high chances of money laundering, given the weak monitoring of our legal framework. Following the NRB’s directive, hopefully, there will be the necessary policies soon to regulate advertising on the social media. The central bank has given assurances that a regulatory framework would be announced soon so as to make payments for advertisements on the digital platforms systematic.

Food shortage
The far-flung villages in most of the districts of Karnali province constantly face a food shortage as the contractors assigned to supply subsidised food items from the Tarai and the nearest depots fail to transport them to the needy areas. A report from Jajarkot’s Barekot Rural Municipality is no exception. Whatever the crops the locals produce barely last them for six months, leaving them high and dry after that. The locals said the food depot in the rural municipality has already run out of stock.
The shortage of food is a perennial problem the central government has not been able to solve. Most of the foodstuffs are transported to the remote areas with the help of mules and horses, which cannot carry adequate amounts of food required in the rural areas. Considering these facts, the provincial government needs to work out a long-term plan for food security and food sovereignty. Instead of depending on food coming from outside, the locals should be encouraged to grow the crops that can easily adapt to the local climate. Food sovereignty is a concept under which the local people develop the habit of consuming the food that they grow locally. This will make them self-reliant on the food that they need.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/money-laundering-2/,"The issue of money laundering in Nepal has activated the role of the Department of Money Laundering Investigation – a government entity responsible for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT) plus other forms of illegal earnings.
Money laundering is akin to laundering clothes. Money laundering is an attempt, or activity, to clean the dirty money to legitimise its illicit sources. While laundering clothes is good for health, laundering money is detrimental for the economy, progress and prosperity of a country.
To put it simply, money laundering is an endeavour, or the process, of converting the proceeds from criminal activities into legitimate income. The major sources of laundered funds are bribery and corruption, economic scam, trafficking, drugs dealing, tax evasion, smuggling, organised crimes and credit card frauds.
Money is laundered in three steps. First, placement. The proceeds of a crime are first brought into the financial
system. Second, layering. Multiple transactions, accounts, banks, intermediaries and countries are used to disguise the origin of the funds. Third, integration. Laundered funds are brought back in the system as legitimate funds.
There are five important techniques involved in the process of money laundering. One is through the use of shell companies, like “jhole companies” with no physical office with the real offices lying in the carrying bag. Another technique is exploiting weak spots in financial institutions. This happens when there is weak supervision of legal structures. Money is also laundered by means of smuggling of physical cash. Likewise, trade-based money laundering (TBML) is also a technique used to clean the money of illicit source through mis-invoicing. Also in vogue is the technique of mixing clean and dirty money in cash intensive business.
The nature and magnitude of money laundering depend on multiple factors: physiological condition, geography, technological advancements and new global trends. Money laundering goes beyond the borders. So it is treated as a transnational crime with global networks. A recent study confirms that the size of money laundering in the world is estimated at about 2-5 per cent of global gross domestic production. Nepal is vulnerable to money laundering because of our weak legal compliance, poor governance system and impunity.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/the-silk-perestroika-a-stupendous-challenge-for-science/,"Research is resourcefully on to tapping and inserting a synthetic gene, or bacteria, to achieving a sublime objective — duplicating the biochemistry of silk and the spider’s ‘psyche’. This foray will substantially increase the stability of its proteins
Silk is Mother Nature’s extraordinary, also astounding, creation — more so, because the little spider, by a biological happenstance, was given the talent to making silk, a fabric like no other. As Robert Boyle, the renowned Anglo-Irish natural philosopher, chemist, physicist and inventor, extolled, we are beholden to the petite caterpillar for silk, just as the little ant-hill motivated King Solomon’s transcendent thought that turned his horse away and his troops followed in agreement — so as not to decimate the tiny living creatures along the route.

The moment this wonderful thing happened, the Queen of Sheba affirmed, to paraphrase: “Oh, wise king, your people are, indeed, happy and contented.
I’ll always remember the exemplar. He only is honourable and great who has empathy for the helpless and weak.”
It’s perhaps apt, in the context, to hark back on the fascinating ancient parable of Archane, a brilliant earthly weaver, who threw down the gauntlet at Athena, the goddess of wisdom and the arts, sans ado. Predictably, Athena’s curse metamorphosed Archane, and her surplus pride, into a spider. The allegory illustrates that it is to the self-effacing spider that we owe the first evidence for weaving cloth. As contemporary philosophy academics, David Werther and Mark Linville, enlighten, every enigmatic thought in a religiously noteworthy sense is best interpreted as a kind of gratitude, knowledge, or ‘connect’ with a fellow being, as also what silk always feels like.
When the ‘Tiger of Mysore’, Tipu Sultan (1750- 1799), pioneered the silk perestroika, he may not have, perhaps, envisioned that science would one day warp the fundamentals.
That is, synthesise the exquisite silk fabric of the future for mass consumption — right from protective clothing, bulletproof jackets and trappings to a ‘diamond’ for one coveted cricket World Cup trophy.
Or, something that would give the miracle weave a new tag — one that could be used as the most durable, also ideal, material in the manufacture of specialised items, viz., parachute cords, synthetic tendons, zero allergy sutures, implants, ‘synthetic’ skin and, most importantly, silk (protein) ‘fixes’ to mend damaged hearts.
For certain folks who may not believe in silky metaphors, they may have to, thanks to noted arachnologist Theodore Savory’s enlightened aphorism, “Silk is the warp and woof of the spider’s life.” It simply means this — from their birth to death, the existence of every spider depends on silk, like every steadfast soldier’s calling to protecting their homeland and its people. This is a noble aphorism that exists in sharp contrast to the troubled times we now live — a world of frenzied upheaval, chaos, hatred and mayhem.
It is agreed and also accepted that a host of earlier endeavours to mass produce silk were big letdowns.
The fact, however, is this — it was not because silk has far too unique properties and untapped potential, or value, but because there’s more to it than what meets the eye. Silk is softer than cotton and stronger than iron; it can withstand greater weights than a cable made of steel. What makes it a novel, also legendary, puzzle is its capability to compensate for the most tempestuous windstorm — by stretching almost 50 per cent longer than its original length. This is because silk is basically a composite material made up of crystals embedded in a matrix.
It can contract — a mechanism which reduces the surface area of the web exposed to the dew, or mist.
This is its classy certitude, too. It enables the encumbrance of moisture to be absorbed by the web structure without collapse.
What’s more, the temperature at which the silk fibre becomes delicate, or breaks, is awfully low, thanks to its ‘glass transition’ temperature.
While research, especially in the West, has made much headway today in understanding the genetic blueprint of the silk protein, there’s more to silk than silk painting and/or what meets its statistical fact file.
A single spider can provide more than a hundred feet of silk at a single ‘silking’, following which it needs a break — to replenish its silk supply. This highlights a primal philosophical facet — there is, as a norm, a limited number of ‘action replays’ because of the spider’s comparatively short life-span.
Hence, research is resourcefully on to tapping and inserting a synthetic gene, or bacteria, to achieving a sublime objective — duplicating the biochemistry of silk and the spider’s ‘psyche’. This foray is believed to, perforce, substantially increase the stability of its proteins, while eliminating certain structural disparities between the synthetic and natural protein and, most importantly, speeding up their production.
Is this going against the fundamental laws of nature or transducing their whole purport, you may well ask, if you are the green-centric type. You may also dub the idea, likewise, as a game-changer, if you are the all-for-technology proponent — although the fact remains that silk is nature at its best. The paradox is apparent. Whatever your stand, the whole idea, or ‘perestroika-in waiting’ is a stupendous challenge for science — not just for the much hyped ‘spider inspired’ wonder, but also for the high tech, silky ‘Revolution Next’ to come of age.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-take-strong-action/,"As an institution, Nepal Police cannot escape from taking legal action against erring policemen involved in Poudel’s extra-judicial killing
Extra-judicial killings by the law enforcement agency in the guise of ‘encounters’ not only renders the judicial system dysfunctional, but also promotes the culture of impunity, leading to gross human rights violation in the society. If the officials responsible for maintaining law and order are not held accountable for their actions, the chain of command within the institution will also collapse, and the general public will no longer trust it in the long run. Taking this into account, the Criminal Code, 2017 has clearly stated that even the security personnel will have to stand trial should they indulge in human rights violations, torture or extra-judicial killings.
Half a dozen people – some of them found to have engaged in criminal and extortion activities – have been killed in fake encounters in the last four years, raising the eyebrows of human rights activists, including the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). The NHRC has written hundreds of letters to the Home Ministry to draw the latter’s attention towards the extra-judicial killings of people, who could have been easily produced before the court of law for trial for their involvement in crimes. But the ministry, except for a few cases, does not seem to be in the mood to take legal action against the police officials involved in the extra-judicial killing.
Against this background, the ministry on Friday directed the Nepal Police to take action against those police officers involved in the killing of Kumar Poudel, Sarlahi district incharge of the outlawed Netra Bikram Chand-led Communist Party of Nepal, on June 20 last year.
The ministry was forced to write a letter to the police headquarters in response to a NHRC report published on October 22, 2019. The report has identified the police officials who fired nine shots to kill Poudel on the banks of Lakhandehi River. The report termed the police action as “extra-judicial killing”.
The NHRC, in its report, says Poudel was shot dead after taking him under control. The NHRC has directed the government to suspend the police officials for their involvement in Poudel’s killing and provide compensation of Rs 300,000 to his family.
This is not an isolated case. The Nepal Police has also earned a bad name for killing persons after taking them under control in the past as well. Notorious gangsters Dinesh Adhikari aka Chari, in Bhimdhunga (August 6, 2014), Kumar Shrestha aka Ghainte, in Samakhushi (August 20, 2015), Pravin Khatri, in Lalitpur (August 7, 2017), Manoj Pun and Som Bahadur Ale, in Devdaha (February 21, 2018) and Gopal Tamang and Ajay Tamang, in Bhaktapur (August 6, 2018) were all killed in fake encounters. All these incidents of extra-judicial killings show the police took the law into their hands to prevent the recurrence of criminal acts. Although the Nepal Police has said it will follow the Home Ministry’s instruction, its assertion that it cannot take action against the erring police officials involved in Poudel’s murder on the ground of the NHRC report means it is still dragging its feet in taking action against them. The killing of such persons in the name of “self-defence” without giving a fair chance to stand trial is a gross violation of the rule of law. The Nepal Police cannot escape from its duty of taking action against the erring officials.

No chicken feed
The unnatural rise in the price of chicken in the past few days has prompted the government to begin a market inspection to know the cause. From Rs 280 a kilo a month ago, the price of chicken has reached Rs 400 in the local market. Poultry firms, in a bid to put pressure on the government to raise the price of chicken, had stopped the production of chicks in their hatcheries for two weeks in December and also destroyed large quantities of ready-to-hatch eggs. The inadequate supply of chicken in the market could be a result of this.
This is the wedding season in Nepal, a time when demand for food, especially meat, suddenly goes up. So when the hosts have to pay extra for the food, it is a big financial burden. Poultry entrepreneurs are always complaining about the high cost of feed and other inputs in running a poultry firm. And they are strongly unionised in stopping cheaper chicken and eggs from entering the country. Thus, ultimately, it is the consumer who pays through the nose for poultry products, which in any country come cheap. To bring prices down, market monitoring alone will not suffice. The firms and retailers should also be penalised if they are found creating the shortage.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/brewing-stories-in-the-himalayas/,"A cozy circle of eight writers at the library of artistic Vajra Hotel share their writings as the rays of the early morning sun fall on them. The atmosphere is magical, and they are on this incredible journey to explore themselves and the chaotic and mystical beauty of Kathmandu.
This is not a usual type of workshop, but an opportunity to immerse oneself. However, these writers do not have a specific purpose—they are not after producing an output. They focus on the process rather than creating something tangible.
I have the power of the pen and must use it to benefit all. I wanted to sharpen my ax so that I could write with all my heart and calm mind, so I decided to participate in this workshop. James Hopkins, Director of Himalayan Writers Workshop (HWW), organizes this workshop every year with a feature writer. James said he created the 10-day workshop, “Wild Writing and Calm Mind”, to “pull the rug out of writers’ feet”. Geography plays an important role in unleashing creativity, and some holy places in Kathmandu ignite inner creativity, and the valley is a mandala.
He was our guide for the meditation practice and touring spiritual shrines.
“Write as poorly as you can,” said Laurie Wagner, our writing coach. She gave us prompts and asked us to write continuously for 10-15 minutes. We would get inspiration from the poems she read to us, and it brought us something we did not expect. I unlearned the assumption that we need to be perfect, and write well. Our writings could be simple and yet powerful. Writing poorly gives us the liberty to be authentic.
We did not strive for perfection yet we created something that cracked our hearts open, and on many occasions, tears rolled from our eyes. Writing made us vulnerable and brave.
“If you feel you should not write about something, then that is the exact thing you must write about,” she said. We were assigned to take photos of whatever attracted us on our journeys and write briefly on them. Being a local of Kathmandu, the places we visited were not new to me. However, I saw Kathmandu through their eyes—full of chaos and mystery.
HWW is a fortunate stroke of serendipity, and I had not imagined I would be writing and unleashing a wild side. The whole experience was like a sign from the universe which directs me to live a creative life, and being the first and only Nepali participant in this workshop felt great.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/political-corruption-state-funding-of-parties-needed/,"In Nepal, debonair politician Dr. Prakash Chandra Lohani, then the finance Minister, had mooted party funding when he presented the annual budget in 2003. Unfortunately, his wise words fell on the deaf ears of MPs
It is heartening to know that Nepal has gone up by eleven places in the Global Corruption Index, according to a recent report published by Transparency International.
Nepal now enjoys 113th rank from the earlier 124th among 180 countries of the world. If New Zealand and Denmark proudly top the list, Somalia embarrassingly finds itself at the bottom.
Though 22 countries have exhibited ascent, for example, Ethiopia by 18 places, an equal number of countries – even the United States – have experienced a slide down in the list by one spot.
Altogether 137 countries, however, remained in their usual state. The corrupting role of special interest money in political party financing has been mainly held responsible for this worrying state of affairs in the report.

Corruption has been rife among countries since a long time. Panchari, that polymath of the first water in the fourth century BC, said that it is just as difficult to catch the corrupt officials red-handed as it is to find fishes drinking water or the bees eating honey. Prithvi Narayan Shah, who integrated several feuding states into what is Nepal today, said that both the taker and giver of bribes are equally responsible and liable even for a death sentence. It shows just how old the history of corruption is in the region and the country.
The corruption level in the political parties is shooting up instead due to their ever increasing expenditure. In a survey conducted by Transparency International in 2016, 90 per cent of the people surveyed said the political parties were the most corrupt in Nepal.
In India, the 2016 election cost a staggering $4 billion. It is said to be the second costliest election after the 2012 US Presidential election.
This colossal amount of money was raised mostly through corporate donation, which reached an astronomical figure of 89 per cent. It is also known as the infamous briefcase politics. In Nepal also, each winning as well as losing Member of Parliament is said to have spent $1 million on average. As a result, cronyism and its all-weather friend corruption raise an ugly head following an election in many countries.
The Westminster Scandal in Britain, the Watergate Scandal in the United States and the Lalita Niwas scandal back in Nepal are manifestations of this phenomenon.
How to cleanse politics of corruption has been one of the most intriguing problems the world over. The panacea has been found in the now widespread party funding. Interestingly, this campaign started from Latin America.
Urugyay may be known as the first country to win the Football World Cup in 1930, but it is also the first country to have introduced party funding ten years earlier in 1920. Germany followed suit in 1950 in Europe, which was followed by the United Kingdom and France.
The United States jumped into the fray in the year 1960 during the tenure of President Kennedy. As a result, 118 countries have adopted this system around the globe. In Nepal, debonair politician Prakash Chandra Lohani, then the finance Minister, had mooted this idea when he presented the annual budget in 2003. Unfortunately, his wise words fell on the deaf ears of the Parliamentarians.
Party funding seeks to create equal influence of all the people in national politics. Generally, the rich and wealthy exercise tremendous influence when compared to a modest voter. This school of thought was coined by political philosophers and democracy scholars like John Rawls, Robert Dahl and Ronald Dworkin.
According to them, democracy requires each of the citizens to not only have equal say in choosing the candidates but also equal opportunity to persuade others.
There can be several modi operandi of financing the political parties. Only national parties that have secured minimum votes in the last election can be given this opportunity as in Belgium or Greece.
Direct funding is provided to the party headquarters or regional offices, the latter being prevalent in the United States. Some countries pay the full amount after the party submits an audited report.
But there are some countries like Germany that provide a matching fund to the fund raised by the parties through small donations.
Indirect funding involves financing for access to public media, free or subsidised public transport for the candidates, free printing or distribution of banners and the like, and providing loans for campaigning. This is practised by almost 68 per cent of the party funding countries.
In India, Goswami, Gupta committees and the like have recommended partial funding only. One such committee recommended imposing a cess of 0.2 per cent of the income paid by individuals and corporate bodies for party funding.
Yet another committee advised allocating $700 million while the expenditure incurred in 2016 was said to be $4 billion. In France, 80 million euros are allocated for this purpose. Dr Lohani had set aside Rs 20 per vote in his budget speech of the year 2003.
Party funding is not without blemishes. It can also be a failure if the politicians do not perform responsibly as in South Africa.
But, it has been successful in several other countries. Nepal can also opt for this funding system to combat the ever rising political corruption in the country.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-quarantine-strictly/,"Our health authorities are advised to see to it that the Nepalis returning from Hubei province in China are quarantined strictly
With a host of countries evacuating their nationals from Hubei province in China, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus outbreak, Nepal, too, will be flying home its citizens later this week. Plans are afoot to send a chartered aircraft of Nepal Airlines Corporation to Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, on Wednesday to airlift some 180 Nepalis who have applied at the Nepali Embassy in Beijing to return home for fear of contracting the virus. Most of the applicants are students who are studying in the Chinese province. There are, however, procedures to be followed before the Nepalis can be flown back home. Before the evacuation, the Nepalis in Hubei will need to undergo a check-up in China to see if they have been infected by the virus. Should they test positive, they will have to stay behind in China for treatment. As for those who can return to Nepal, the Nepali government must give assurances to its Chinese counterpart that they would be quarantined strictly before they leave for home.
With time running out fast, the Ministry of Health and Population has proposed a number of places in the Kathmandu Valley to quarantine the Nepalis who will be landing in Kathmandu this week. They include NEA and ADB training centres in Bhaktapur, the Nepal Administrative Staff College at Jawalakhel, the Ayurvedic Teaching Hospital in Kirtipur and even an apartment block at Ichangu Narayan in Kathmandu. Barring the Ayurvedic hospital, any other site will require laying the minimum facilities to quarantine the Nepalis for at least two weeks before they are free to travel home. This means erecting facilities overnight for them to sleep and eat, having a team of doctors and nurses to tend to them round the clock, emergency care should someone fall sick, and, above all, security so that no one steps outside the compound so as to prevent any type of contact with outside people.
So far, no one has tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Nepal, although some suspected cases did throw up a scare. However, for the first time this week, Nepalis in such large numbers will be flying home directly from the Chinese province, where the deadly virus is spreading rapidly and claiming lives. The novel coronavirus has killed 304 people in China so far, which is about 2 per cent of the 14,380 infected as of Saturday. Our health authorities are, therefore, advised to take all the necessary measures to see that they are quarantined satisfactorily and released only when there is guarantee that they pose no health threats. In the event of an outbreak, Nepal can ill afford to erect a hospital overnight as in China to contain the virus. Thus, prevention is the key to keep the disease at bay. China apart, now that suspected cases have also been reported in more than two dozen countries, including the developed world, it is necessary to thoroughly screen all visitors coming to this country by air or land. At times like this, regulating the long open border with India at short notice is a major challenge, where a second case of the novel coronavirus has been reported. But there is no alternative. All you need is one infected person to spread the virus from one human to another and start an epidemic.

Child care homes
The number of children ending up in child care homes is on the rise every year, according to a report published by the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens. There were a total of 14,864 children – 7,194 boys and 7,670 girls – in child care homes across the country in 2017-18. However, the number reached 15,565 in 2018-19. More boys were found to be living in child care centres compared to girls in 2018-19. There are as many as 533 child care homes registered with the government in 46 districts. But most of the child care homes do not meet the standard set by the National Child Rights Council (NCRC). Providing shelter alone is not enough. The children, who have been abandoned by their parents or rescued from the streets, also deserve a basic education and minimum health care. The ultimate goal of the NCRC should be to reunite them with their families so that they can lead a normal life when they grow up. Those children living in the child care homes should be sent to public schools to ensure that they can mix up with other kids and also learn life skills and values of a family. The local levels can play a vital role in ensuring that the child care homes provide basic services to the helpless kids.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/ebbing-respect/,"After a grueling day at work, I and my colleagues decided to enjoy a couple of drinks at the bar. Moving out of our workaholic demeanor, we loosened our neckties, unbuttoned our collars, twisted our necks and stretched our bodies.
Aadil, my chum friend, booked a cab, and we all sat in for a frolicsome night ahead.
After grappling with the satanic traffic of Delhi, we eventually reached the portals of our destination. We were assigned a table for four, and the attendant in a very sophisticated manner approached us with a notepad and a pen. All four of us read the menu extensively and placed a traditional order of tandoori chicken and masala papad.
As I was looking around, my eyes caught attention of a teenager dancing and drinking beer with his friends. I was enjoying every bit of it until I learnt who actually the person was. It was none other than my own nephew. I was astounded beyond limits, and it had already ruined my day. He too looked back at me but did not show any signs of remorse or embarrassment, rather he came up to me and asked me to accompany him to the dance floor. I thought to myself how drastically time has changed.
There was a time when we could not even dare to drink or smoke in front of our parents or elders. Once I went to a variety store near my home and asked for a pack of cigarettes. The shopkeeper resisted and as a signal coughed to make me aware of my father’s presence at the other end of the shop. I somehow did not pay heed and asked in a rather harsh voice. The shopkeeper instead said in a loud voice, “Chacha Ji, what else do you want?” On realising the gravity of the situation, my blood ran cold, and I with all my might ran home.I was rinsing my hands with soap when my father arrived and said sarcastically,” If you had asked for cigarettes, you must have got them,” and threw a packet before me. But who would have the courage to pick that up!
Habitually, I used to smoke on the way to the shop every morning. Once I reached the shop and just 3-4 minutes later, my elder brother came. Had he come a bit early, I would have been caught. But what happened next was a bolt from the blue. My elder brother said, “Look, either you smoke fast or walk fast. Because of you, I had to linger on the road for no reason.” That was again respect, a mutual recognition between father and sons and brothers unlike today’s generation that does not even show any respect whatsoever.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/brexit-what-does-it-mean-for-us/,"The EU will remain a loyal partner of Nepal in all sectors where it has, for many years, provided financial support and assistance, such as education, sustainable rural development, federalisation, and trade and investment
On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom left the European Union. We lost a member of our family. It was a sad moment for us, for European citizens – and, indeed, for many British citizens.
Nevertheless, we have always respected the sovereign decision of 52 per cent of the British electorate, and we now look forward to starting a new chapter in our relations.
Emotions aside, February 1 turned out to be historic but also undramatic. This is largely thanks to the Withdrawal Agreement that we negotiated with the UK, which enabled us to secure ‘an orderly Brexit’. One that – at least for now – minimises disruption for our citizens, businesses, public administrations – as well as for our international partners.
Under this agreement, the EU and the UK agreed on a transition period, until the end of 2020 at least, during which the UK will continue to participate in the EU’s Customs Union and Single Market, and to apply EU law, even if it is no longer a Member State.
During this period, the UK will also continue to abide by the international agreements of the EU, as we made clear in a note verbale to our international partners. So, with the transition period in place, there is a degree of continuity. This was not easy given the magnitude of the task.
By leaving the Union, the UK automatically, mechanically, legally, leaves hundreds of international agreements concluded by or on behalf of the Union, to the benefit of its Member States, on topics as different as trade, aviation, fisheries or civil nuclear cooperation.
We now have to build a new partnership between the EU and the UK. That work will start in a few weeks, as soon as the EU 27 have approved the negotiating mandate proposed by the European Commission, setting out our terms and ambitions for achieving the closest possible partnership with a country which will remain our ally, our partner and our friend.
The EU and the UK are bound by history, by geography, culture, shared values and principles and a strong belief in rules-based multilateralism.
Our future partnership will reflect these links and shared beliefs. We want to go well beyond trade and keep working together on security and defence, areas where the UK has experiences and assets that are best used as part of a common effort.
In a world of big challenges and change, of turmoil and transition, we must consult each other and cooperate, bilaterally and in key regional and global fora, such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, NATO or the G20.
It is perhaps a cliché, but the basic truth is that today’s global challenges – from climate change to cybercrime, terrorism or inequality – require collective responses.
The more the UK is able to work in lockstep with the EU and together with partners around the world, the greater our chances of addressing these challenges effectively.
At the very core of the EU project is the idea that we are stronger together; that pooling our resources and initiatives is the best way of achieving common goals. Brexit does not change this, and we will continue to take this project forward as 27.
Together, the 27 Member States will continue to form a single market of 450 million citizens and more than 20 million businesses.
Together, we remain the largest trading bloc in the world. Together, at 27, we are still the world’s largest development aid donor.
Our partners can be sure that we will stay true to an ambitious, outward-looking agenda – be it on trade and investment, on climate action and digital, on connectivity, on security and counter-terrorism, on human rights and democracy, or on defence and foreign policy.
We will continue to live up to our commitments and agreements that link us to our international partners.
Nepal can, therefore, be reassured of our determination to stand at its side. Not only to help the country facing the important challenges that await it in the future, such as the consequences of climate change or the protection of human rights. But also to remain a loyal partner in all sectors where the EU has, for many years, provided financial support and assistance, such as education, sustainable rural development, federalisation, and trade and investment.
In this regard, we will, of course, continue to ensure the privileged status of Nepal as a trading partner, which include, among others, the duty and quota-free access to the EU market.
Together With Nepal, as with all our other partners in the world, we want more than ever to be the defenders of rules-based multilateralism and a more secure and fair world.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-comply-with-statute/,"The proposed CIAA bill must be compatible with the constitution, which has given it powers and defined its jurisdiction
A constitutional body like the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) should not be given more powers than what has been stated in the constitution. The more powers it is given, the more the chances of their misuse if past instances are anything to go by. It is, therefore, imperative that the lawmakers hold wider consultations with the concerned stakeholders and constitutional experts before making an amendment to the bill related to the CIAA. Before any amendment to an act is made, it should also be in conformity with the constitution, which has clearly defined the role and powers of such a body. Recently the government tabled a bill to this effect at the National Assembly, proposing to give more legal teeth to the anti-graft body. It may be recalled that the CIAA, while submitting its annual report to the President on December 24, had also sought more powers so that it could launch a probe even on the policy-level decisions taken by the council of ministers, a demand, many believe, is beyond the scope of the constitution.
As per the constitutional provisions, the CIAA can investigate a public officer only when it has reasons to believe that the erring officer has abused power through corruption. But a new provision proposes giving it powers to take action against a public officer even for ‘abusing’ power. The mere abuse of power should not come under the CIAA’s jurisdiction. Likewise, the bill proposes taking action against those public officers who have not followed the mandatory procedures, or passed the buck to others, taking action against public officers for sealing a public procurement deal without following the due process. However, as per Article 239 (4) of the constitution, the CIAA has been authorised only to draw the attention of the concerned officer for making mistakes. Neither has the bill defined the meaning of ‘policy decision’ taken by the officials.
Section 13 (a) of the bill has authorised the CIAA to seek any certified copy of any document from any office. This provision, if passed as it is, might adversely impact a development project as in the past. The construction of a development project might be unnecessarily delayed, leading to cost overruns. If the CIAA is allowed to probe into irregularities or corruption in any project or programme, the bill should also clearly mention how much time the CIAA should take to complete its findings. The proposal of taking action against a public office holder on charges of ‘improper act’ is also unconstitutional as the new constitution has removed it from the CIAA’s jurisdiction. Both the letter and spirit of the constitution has it that the CIAA can take legal action against a public office holder only when s/he is found to have indulged in corruption. However, it cannot take any pre-emptive action against anyone else, assuming that s/he is going to abuse authority through corruption. A bill must be compatible with the constitution. This is where the lawmakers must use their conscience and make prudent judgments while drafting or amending the bill. They must also keep in mind that a bill that contradicts the constitution will be declared null and void by the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court.

Child abuse
Revelation by a report of the Bangkok-based ECPAT International that Nepali children are at high risk of sexual exploitation should not raise many eyebrows. Almost daily reports of child abuse, especially sexual exploitation, in the media attest to just how vulnerable they are to such abuse in society. Poverty is the main reason why children, especially girls, become susceptible to sexual exploitation. It makes them vulnerable to trafficking or forces them to take up jobs where they could be exploited, such as the entertainment industry both inside and outside the country.
Child, early and forced marriages, as a way of coping with economic hardships, also raise children’s vulnerability to sexual violence. Education, as a right enshrined in the constitution, holds the key to preventing the sexual exploitation of children. Quality education with emphasis on learning a trade will prepare them for life and embolden them to make decisions that concern them, including marriage. If the government has the will, there is no reason why many of the social ills cannot be abolished, as has been shown by its crusade to tear down all the menstruation huts in the ru

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/training-a-means-to-adapt-to-change/,"Are we all perfect? Do we need to update ourselves with the changing environment? Adaptation is a key to succeeding in this changing environment. An external environment – political, economic or technological – is not in our control. Changes in these environments are continuous, and it is important to adapt to these changes to survive in this world.
This applies to everyone, from the employees to business owners. But the question is, how can we adapt quickly to the changes and move ahead? This is where training comes into the picture. Training is teaching a person a particular skill or type of behaviour. An expert trains other people to make them aware of a particular skill in which he has expertise.
We can be trained to perform different functions, but we do not need to be an expert. For example, a finance manager of an organisation is an expert in financial management, but it is also necessary for him/her to understand the latest financial technologies. This can be learnt through training, and for the finance manager to share his expertise, he can facilitate a financial management training.
Training can be achieved through different means. One can learn things from the internet or by taking classes or by attending a conference or seminar. However, each and every source of training involves some cost. Even learning from Google has an internet cost associated with it. Some of us think apart from self-learning, other modes are just a mere out of pocket expense. But it is necessary to understand that the cost involved in training is an individual’s investment in themselves.
For example, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has just directed the commercial banks to implement goAML. This is a change in the economic policy in the external environment. Experts from the NRB are involved in increasing awareness about goAML through trainings and seminars, and as such, banking professionals first involved in the trainings can later conduct meetings within the organisations to train other employees. This not only helps us to adapt to the changes quickly but also reduces the investment in training employees.
The recent compulsory adoption of Nepal Accounting Standard (NAS) for Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) is another example of change. The implementation requires awareness, and training helps to raise it within the target groups. Later, such target groups by sharing their knowledge through training help to spread the awareness further.
Overall, we talk about government generating revenue through taxes and making the economic system transparent, accountable and sustainable, and training is something which is essential to achieve all these things. Therefore, training is an investment rather than just a mere expense

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/sustainable-conservation-possible-only-when-the-locals-benefit/,"It has been substantiated that poor people bear the brunt of conserving the protected areas while the rich – mostly outsiders enjoy the greater share of the benefits. This will only widen the rift between them
Nepal is doing exceptionally well in biodiversity conservation, which has been globally lauded. Now, some outsiders, wealthy and influential, are scrounging to take advantage of it. The government has drafted a new provision in a bid to encourage a range of commercial tourism activities in the core and buffer zone of the Protected Areas (PAs) of the country.
This move is aimed at augmenting the Visit Nepal 2020 tourist arrivals. However, there is a rallying call regarding the negative impact the proposed provision will have on biodiversity and, in particular, to the wildlife thriving in these protected areas. Taking into account the conservation experts’ view, evidence generated by researches and previous experience of other countries, the cry of the conservationists is well-founded.

Consider that these activities are established and run within the environmental limits. If this situation exists, the conservationist might also give a green signal, and it will be a source of lofty revenue for the government, high income for the owners and job opportunities for the most affected poor local people through conservation. What more could you ask from these tourism activities? It’s a neat win-win win approach for all.
But there is yet another story of paramount importance, which is neglected – about the share of benefits from tourism activities the local people living there for decades are getting. Don’t these stories deserve to be heard? Or is expecting the locals to get a fair share of the tourism benefits a more-than-realistic target? Legitimately and rationally, the answer should have been a clear “No.” But things always do not work out that way. These are critical yet fundamental issues that should have received prominence in policy and implementation.
The local inhabitants that live in the vicinity of the PAs are dominantly poor. The relation between the protected areas and poverty is a long-standing debate in academic and policy circles.
However, it has also been richly substantiated that poor people bear the brunt of conserving the PAs while the rich – mostly outsidersenjoy the greater share of the benefits.
And this very move will be a factor widening the rift between these two categories of people.
Proponents of the provision might put forward the logic that once these activities begin operating, they will also benefit the local communities significantly. Superficially, it seems the right reasoning and intention. But when we delve deeper into the matter, won’t it be plausible to say that the claim they are parroting is obstructing justice to the local people? Or implicit biases cloaked in the form of opportunity? The locals should be the owner of the opportunities if they exist.
Or is there legitimacy in treating the poor people always as subservient? People who are the stewards of our much-hailed conservation and must face the brutal cost of it are being compensated by scanty menial and low-paying jobs. What is even more crucial is, who will guarantee that the people and product use will be more local? This case epitomises the
case of allowing access to people from outside but excluding myriads of diverse indigenous people and local people. This could lead to not only rancorous public disagreements but also resentment to conserve the biodiversity of those wild places.
The handful of outside and opulent people take away the dominant pie of the benefits, a few natives get minimal benefits while the majority of the natives shoulder the cost of conserving a global public good. Isn’t this outright discrimination? It is an alliance of corporate capital and policymakers, and marginalising the poor people – the perfect working of capitalism at the micro-level.
A more justifiable, empowering and leadership role has to be handed over to the local people, the poor in particular. Doable actions are critical to stop the agitation for the dismantling of the protected areas and also to avoid those conservation interventions that cause more harm to those people. All these will ensure the sustained success of conservation. Interventions include capacity building of local communities, as they need guidance and technical assistance in setting up commercial arrangements, a conducive environment for high-spending tourists to enjoy in their homestay or similar accommodations, and developing the right kind of tourism infrastructure, among others.
In essence, the locals should take the lead role while providing these sorts of services and facilities to the visitors so that they can reap not just as much as they possibly can, but also generate a comparable amount of revenue if these activities are operated by opulent outsiders.
Also, these kinds of activities are likely to be more conservation-friendly and, more importantly, a large share of the revenue generated would be channeled back for conservation purpose and to the communities. When the benefits of tourism flow primarily to the local communities, they will value the protected parks more. Thus, this will be a more sustainable and purposeful strategy.
If we take the view that the typical opportunities and arrangements offered through tourism activities, which has become a well-established tradition, are good enough, especially for the poor local people, then it’s time to talk about the lopsided perspective.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-inefficient-production/,"Manufacturing sector must remain robust because it is one of the biggest job creators
Nepal’s manufacturing sector, in general, is churning out only half of the goods that it should be producing, indicating inefficient use of machinery and plants installed in factories. The latest central bank report shows that the manufacturing sector, on average, utilised 57.1 per cent of its capacity in the last fiscal year, as against 59.7 per cent recorded in 2017-18. Ironically, average capacity utilisation of the manufacturing sector has taken a hit despite hike in production capacity. For example, cement factories enhanced their production capacity by 2.9 million tonnes last fiscal year. But their actual production went up by a mere 79,501 tonnes. Similar trend was seen in firms that produced steel. Their production capacity jumped by 94,500 tonnes in the last fiscal year, but their actual production went up by 40,640 tonnes. A number of other manufacturing firms have also seen discrepancy in production capacity and actual production. This shows fresh investments were made to set up new factories or add new machinery to existing factories, but those production facilities were not put to optimum use. This is not a good sign because inefficient use of available capacity eventually pushes up production cost as investors will price their goods after factoring in the cost of new machinery as well. This will unnaturally inflate prices of goods, fuelling inflation.
The central bank report has not provided reasons for low production despite jump in production capacity. But it comes at a time when binding constraints such as short-supply of grid electricity and labour-related problems have largely been removed. It is, thus, time for the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Supplies to spring into action and identify problems that are crippling the manufacturing sector. Every country tries to keep its manufacturing sector robust because it is one of the biggest job creators. This is the reason why even a developed country like the US is doing all it can to bring back manufacturing jobs that have been moved to China and other countries. So, Nepal, which has seen large-scale outmigration of workers in the last two decades, cannot just sit back because low capacity utilisation of manufacturing firms also indicates erosion in job creation. Around 500,000 people join the job market every year, but the unemployment rate stands at 11.4 per cent, while the labour underutilisation rate hovers around 39 per cent. Nepal must fix these problems at the earliest as it will become an aged society after 2047 when fewer working-age people will have to support a greater number of elderly.
Many countries across the globe provide subsidies, reduce import taxes on raw materials and intermediate goods, and raise import duties on finished goods to stimulate domestic production and bolster competitiveness of domestic industries. The government should also offer incentives to the manufacturing sector for the time being to lure investors so that the problems of unemployment, underemployment and massive outmigration could be addressed. While providing incentives priority should be given to firms that export their goods as it would also help the country earn foreign currency. A country can only become prosperous if it is able to create as many jobs as possible inside the country.

Rhino deaths
Thirteen rhinos have died in the seven months of the current fiscal year at Chitwan National Park, and this is cause for worry. The female rhino in its early twenties that died on Tuesday was carrying a 10-month-old foetus in her womb, which again is a big loss. Most rhinoceroses live to be about 50 or more years. There was a time when poachers were very active in the jungle, especially during the critical insurgency period. Even a rhino in the central zoo in Kathmandu was not spared. The rhinos are killed for their horn, which fetches a heavy price in the aphrodisiac market. But with stricter patrolling, poaching is little heard of now.
For conservationists, the increasing number of deaths due to natural causes is just as worrisome, even alarming. As many as 43 rhinos are said to have died of natural causes last fiscal year, 26 in 2017-18, and 25 the year before that. Rhinos die due to old age, clashes between bulls during the mating season, getting caught in quicksand and epidemics. But no sign of contagious disease has been detected among the rhinos. The rhino is the principal attraction in the park, and the root cause of the deaths must be established soon before it starts impacting tourism.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/demise-of-books/,"My nephew had turned four this last March. It was time to secure him admission in one of the schools – a new English medium school. As we approached the school to meet the principal, the latter boastfully said that he was all set to usher in a paperless education system based on the foreign model. His idea could have convinced some elite of the town to send their children to his school.
But I had turned painfully pensive. “Are we heading towards an era of the demise of books?” In this age of technological advancement, indeed our reading manners and modes have changed drastically.
Unlike our school days, today paper-books have been replaced by their modern e-counterparts. With this transition, perhaps the pleasure of reading has almost lost its previous sheen. I still grow nostalgic about my childhood days when my father would fetch a storybook once in a while for me. Over the years, this regular practice not only made me a voracious reader but also a bibliophile.
The fragrance of the paper would tickle my senses and spontaneously draw me towards its source. Sepia turned pages due to the ageing process had their own complexion on which each carefully enshrined word would bustle with life.
Perhaps this could be an impelling reason why I had always dealt with words in a sensitive manner. The district library of our city is also on the brink of its extinction. In the absence of other means of amusement, reading was the chief delight for the people of my generation.
The famous English Book Depot of our city also used to be a popular destination for reading lovers. But it has also witnessed a similar fate. With the arrival of a click-away e-books, the book stores find the rarest of rare takers now.
I am only able to fathom the depth of this unpalatable transition when the other day I am proffered an unsolicited advice from my techno-smart niece.
Seeing me holding the newspaper in my hands, the child chips in, “Barey Papa, why don’t you read the e-paper on my laptop?”
She also suggests downloading the e-dictionary on my phone instead of looking up the words in the bulky paper dictionary.
Truly speaking e-books, e-papers and e-dictionaries may have offered us easy access to the reading material, but they have certainly taken a toll on the quality of reading and reduced a completely cathartic pleasure to a mere mechanical activity and a bland affair.

For the Nepalis who have been ensured reliable power supply since the last few years, there is even better news, and it sounds almost too good to be true. Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) is proposing reducing power tariffs levied on households. The draft proposing the tariff reduction is set to be approved at the NEA’s board meeting this week, which will then be forwarded for final approval to the Nepal Electricity Regulatory Commission. The government’s bid to encourage households to consume more power comes in the wake of the surplus energy that will be generated by a host of new hydroelectricity projects from this fiscal year. The draft of the government power utility has proposed slashing the per unit rate with the rise in consumption in sharp contrast to the present provision that raises the rate as consumption surges. What’s more, for those households using only 20 units of electricity a month, 10 units will come free. The Rs 3 service fee charged on a unit of electricity for those households in this low consumption bracket has also been dropped.
Just ten years back, no one could have imagined the current scenario. It was a time when residents even in the capital saw power outages lasting upto 16-18 hours a day, forcing them to rely on the expensive inverters and other gadgets for light. NEA’s draft proposal will benefit almost everyone in the country, as almost 96 per cent of the population has access to electricity today. Only about 1.3 million inhabitants of a handful of districts in Karnali province will not profit. With the new policy, one can expect households to switch to electricity for cooking as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) will become dearer with the government doing away with the subsidy provided on it. This will have a favourable impact on our trade as Nepal imports LPG gas worth more than Rs 35 billion a year.
While the NEA’s tariff reduction plan is bound to cheer households and also big consumers of dedicated and trunk lines in the near future, it must have a strategy – and very soon – to divert power to more productive areas. It makes little sense to be producing surplus energy and not knowing what to do with it. While a host of countries have shown interest in buying surplus power from Nepal, it is also time the government thought of utilising some of the energy to produce goods in the country itself. Why not one large fertiliser or an aluminium smelting plant in the country? They will guzzle nearly all of the energy to be generated by the power projects under construction. It’s also time to promote electric vehicles wholeheartedly, which will further cut down on our fuel import bills. It’s unfortunate that the government has just scrapped a deal to buy 300 electric buses that would have also improved the quality of air in Kathmandu. The NEA has, however, done a good job to call tenders for setting up a handful of charging stations, but they are too few to make any impact. Electricity is the foundation for the development of all sectors of the economy, including industry, agriculture and tourism. But how we develop depends on how judiciously we use it.

Leprosy control
Though Nepal declared the elimination of leprosy in 2010, it continues to haunt 17 districts, most of them in the Tarai. The burden of leprosy is constantly rising in the southern districts of the country, with 3,000 new cases being diagnosed annually. Province 2 has the highest number of leprosy cases. Leprosy Control and Disability Management Section estimates that the disease has so far caused disabilities in over 31,000 people, and the number of those undergoing a complete multi-drugs course stands at more than 192,000.
Study shows that poor knowledge, an unfavourable attitude and stigma are a hindrance to leprosy control, forcing the affected ones to live in isolation or conceal the disease, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. The knowledge and attitude of the community towards leprosy remains poor. Positive change in the community’s perception towards leprosy is a must for its prevention and control. The federal and local governments should develop advocacy programmes to make information, education and communication materials accessible to the general public to enhance people’s knowledge regarding leprosy, its cause, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment.

Co-ordination of actors and establishment of an appropriate financing mechanism for the expansion of the system in time of shocks is the key
Social protection is defined as a set of public actions that address the deprivation and vulnerabilities of the poorest, and the need of the currently non-poor for security in the face of shocks and the particular demands of different stages of the life cycle. It could be labelled as ‘social assistance’, ‘social care’, ‘social insurance’, and ‘labour market policies’. Social protection is thus an investment in people and the country as it eases the budget constraint of households allowing them to invest.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Social protection programmes implemented in Nepal include child grants; cash transfers for senior citizens, people with disabilities, endangered ethnic communities and single women; support to the Karnali Employment Programme; and other poverty reduction, micro-insurance initiatives.
All social protections deal with shocks in some way. The social protection sector can contribute by building households’ resilience to shocks, preparing systems and programmes, recognising that shocks may happen and supporting people after the shock. In the current context of shocks, such as natural disasters, pandemics, conflict and violence, there is a need to think about how social protection models can be made shock responsive, scalable or adaptive.
Global literature suggests five key options for shock-responsive adaptation – design tweaks (making small adjustments to the design of the core programme); piggybacking (borrowing elements of an existing programme or system while delivering a separate emergency response); vertical expansion (topping up support to beneficiaries); horizontal expansion (temporarily extending support to new households); and alignment of humanitarian interventions with one another.
Shock responsive social protection (SRSP) seeks to improve the preparedness of the social protection system to respond to shocks. It targets mostly the marginalised people, especially children, lactating women, elderly, Dalits and persons with disabilities. Integration of Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) into the development planning at the Palika and provincial level has been initiated to benefit those who are most vulnerable.
There have also been some notable efforts in the country on SRSP in terms of evidence generation and pilot interventions. Following the devastating earthquake in Nepal in 2015, UNICEF, through government support, carried out a $24 million Emergency Cash Transfer Programme (ECTP) in two phases. Phase 1 covered 19 districts with 434,000 beneficiaries whereas Phase II covered 11 districts with 317,000 beneficiaries. Similarly, a collaborative project of the government, DFID and UNICEF is implementing a pilot project on shock responsive preparedness in eight most disaster-prone Palikas. Likewise, evidence generation is ongoing to assess the effectiveness of the existing social protection system to respond to floods.
The World Bank also conducted a three-year Panel Survey between 2016 and 2018, covering 18,000 households in 50 districts. For natural disasters, assets fell by 7-12% in the year of the shock. Households were 3.5-6.5% more likely to be moderately or severely food insecure that year. The survey findings show that most households rely on savings and borrowing to cope with shocks. However, they borrow at higher interest rates, especially the poor and in more remote areas. A large minority have to resort to reducing food and other expenditures.
Amidst opportunities, challenges also exist to effectively implement SRSP in Nepal. Co-ordination of actors and establishment of an appropriate financing mechanism for the expansion of the system in time of shocks is the key. Registration of new beneficiaries along with effective communication is also necessary to explain why certain people are suddenly being covered by the programme and then dropped.
Manual and decentralised record keeping of the beneficiary’s information is a major hurdle for addressing issues of duplication, under-coverage and weak oversight facing the administration of the social assistance programmes. So, there are concerns of data quality and validity.
As the social protection system must also respond to shocks, it involves a trade-off with some of the key criteria underpinning humanitarian response, such as timeliness, coverage of the affected population and adequacy of the support provided. Mitigating the extent to which this is the case requires a legislative framework and institutional architecture that is built for the purpose. Funding mechanism is another key aspect. SRSP requires a funding mechanism to which multiple donors can contribute.
As SRSP implementation requires multi-sectoral engagement, coordination of all stakeholders is pivotal. Coordination should also be linked to national early warning monitoring systems so as to prepare in advance for an approaching emergency.
Thus, there is a need to integrate social protection expansion as a response mechanism into the national disaster management framework; improve local capacity through both regular systems strengthening and contingency planning; develop complementary standard operating procedures for emergency contexts; and identify ways that humanitarian actors can support or complement disaster response through existing government systems.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/i-believe-in-a-cup-of-tea/,"A cup of tea tempted me when I was a kid. I saw that a cup of tea refreshed my mom after a day loaded with work. In the morning, dad used to wait for tea eagerly with the morning newspaper. After passing sometime with the headlines, dad would take a peek in the kitchen if the tea was late on the table. “Yes, that is what I want,” dad said after a sip from the cup.
I was under-aged to have tea. But I was obsessed with its aroma. One day, I made tea in a lazy afternoon. I was a novice, didn’t know how to handle a cup of hot tea. So, it burnt my tongue. This was the first experience I had with tea. Now, a cup of tea is something that never leaves me alone, soothes me, gives me strength, makes my mood, and sometimes reminds me of some priceless faces from my past.
I remember those chilly winter mornings. I would sit with my grandma beside a window, digging memories from her past. A sip of tea kept us warm, fresh and talkative. Whenever I had flu with a sore throat, it was tea flavoured with ginger that fought the disease.
I was always lazy, liked to keep postponing my assignments till before the night of the deadline. Sometimes I was tensed. I had to work the whole night to finish my work when everyone was sleeping.
But the magic of the steaming tea swirled in every wrinkle of my brain, kept me awake and diligent to complete my homework. After those painstaking nights, a warm cup of tea refreshed me again in the morning, loosened my agitated mind and energized me for the rest of the day.
I also admired my friendship with tea. Cups of different colours, sizes and shapes filled most of the spaces of my kitchen cabinet. Sometimes tea was a luxury for me. The taste of tea, mingled with lemon juice, would keep whispering in my mouth more than an hour after I had it. I could feel the flow of tea in every blood vessel of my body. Far from my home, tea was the only alibi of those cheerful days I passed with my friends in the dorm.
I believe in a cup of tea that reminds me of my past, makes me nostalgic and teaches me to feel for something so ordinary. I believe in a cup of tea, which helps me to continue and cherish some relationships in my life. I believe a cup of tea is like glue that fastens me with family events. A cup of tea is something that consoles me in my grief, makes me stronger and lives in the folds of my mind and brain.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-impractical-clauses/,"As the Media Council is related to the media outlets, its chair must come from among working journalists, not outside
After much criticism from all walks of life, including the media fraternity, civil society and human rights activists, the National Assembly Legislative Management Committee on Monday made major corrections on the punitive clause and adopted a fairly reconciliatory approach in the Media Council Bill, tabled by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology at the Upper House last year. Earlier, the ministry had proposed a fine of up to Rs 1 million against journalists, editors and publishers breaching the code of conduct issued by the council. The provision was dubbed as a government ploy to curb freedom of expression, guaranteed by the constitution, which has clearly stated that no press shall be seized or penalised for publishing any materials against anyone. The Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) had even launched phase-wise protests against the bill. The panel amended the bill by removing the punitive provision. As per the provision, the council shall work to forge reconciliation if any dispute arises between a media outlet and the affected persons or parties. The new clause has allowed an affected party to move the court for judicial remedy for damage to its reputation, prestige and dignity. Such a dispute shall be settled by a regular court.
In the amended provision, the 11-member Media Council shall act as an autonomous body, which shall have representation from the FNJ, seven representatives from the seven provinces representing the print, online and broadcast outlets and university teachers in journalism. The new provision has set qualification criteria, under which the council chair should be a person who is eligible to become a Supreme Court justice, or a senior lawyer or a journalist having at least 15 years of working experience with extraordinary contribution to the sector. The amended bill has also removed a clause for a recommendation committee to be formed by the government. From now onwards, a person pursuing journalism must sit for a council exam to get a journalism licence.
While the amended bill deserves praise for removing the punitive clause against mediapersons and publishers, the bill still has some impractical provisions that need improvement. The condition that the council chair must have the qualification of an apex court justice or a senior lawyer and that a new entrant in journalism must sit for a council exam are impractical. The council should not be there to issue journalism licences. In a free society, the media outlets are competent enough to recruit the human resources they require. The council chair must come only from amongst the working journalists, not from outside. The ‘reconciliatory’ approach added in the amended bill is also inconsistent with the media code of conduct and international practices, as the bill has already allowed the affected person to move the court for legal remedy. The credibility of the media is judged not by the council, but solely by the public. The only job of the council should be to caution or draw the attention of media outlets if they breach the code. The government’s duty should be to bring about a broader media policy so that the media can sustain on their own strength.
Never again
To be honest, today’s youths know little about their country’s history, let alone what took place in countries far from the homeland. Although the Internet is a mine of information on any topic, without one having to buy a book or visit a library, unfortunately, it might not be used for the purpose intended. History is not a popular subject in Nepal’s colleges, and whatever is taught in school about world history will only skim through the different events in brief. How many of today’s youth will have heard about the Holocaust in which seven million Jews were systematically exterminated by Nazi Germany in concentration camps as part of the final solution to the Jewish race?
This year marks the 75th anniversary of the end of WWII, and it is good that the government, the United Nations in Nepal and several embassies have gotten together to educate students in 25 schools of the Kathmandu Valley about the horrors of the Holocaust. It was discrimination and intolerance that led to the Holocaust, and students must be made to understand that without justice, respect and compassion, there is every danger of that dark reality in history repeating somewhere on this planet.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/corruption-in-healthcare-its-killing-nepalis/,"Corruption in the health budget has crippled Nepal’s health system. Given the scarce resources, the funds lost through it could otherwise buy lifesaving medicines and supplies, fund operations and hire more skilled health workers
“Corruption is a tradition. It might be wrong, but it is not illegal.” As a healthcare officer in Nepal, I often hear these words. Corruption is so rampant in Nepal’s health system that we accept it as a norm. Nepalis are deprived of quality healthcare services due to the unwritten rules of corruption. Healthcare corruption threatens accessibility, utilisation and quality of healthcare service and ultimately paralyses the healthcare system. Nepali women have lost their lives during childbirth owing to consequences of corruption.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
The Nepali government allocates not much of its total budget for healthcare: less than 5 per cent. Because of financial embezzlement, healthcare is left with even less money. One report estimated that more than 5 per cent of the global health budget is lost to corruption even before it leaves the central government offices—from my personal experience the number is much higher for Nepal. According to the 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index, Nepal is among the world’s most corrupt countries (ranking 124 out of 175).
A well-run healthcare system requires not only sufficient funding but also effective spending. If wisely spent, resources could cover more people’s needs. According to the World Health Organisation, most countries could achieve significantly greater health system performance even at the current level of healthcare spending. Corruption in the health budget has crippled Nepal’s health system. The money lost to corruption degrades the quality of healthcare and reduces the availability and utilisation of services. In a country like Nepal where resources are already scarce, the funds lost through corruption could otherwise buy lifesaving medicines and supplies, fund operations and maintenance, and hire more skilled health workers.
Many Nepalis have lost their lives owing to corruption in the health sector. I have witnessed corruption in the purchase and distribution of medicines, which ultimately causes a shortage of drugs. Nepal’s high child mortality rate can also be partly attributed to the shortage of oral rehydration salts for children with diarrhoea, which owes to corruption, as well as to corruption in the immunisation programme. Shortage of medicine compels patients to pay for it.
Besides, broken medical equipment is often left unrepaired. Healthcare managers prefer to purchase expensive new equipment rather than repair the existing one as there is a huge kickback on the purchase. Patients are forced to visit a private health facility due to interruption of the services. This undermines Nepalis’ trust in healthcare services.
Corruption in the procurement of drugs is a big problem. Health officials usually expect illegal financial benefits while purchasing drugs. As a result, substandard drugs with a high financial beneficial package are procured rather than what is needed for the community. Use of such drugs won’t make patients feel better, therefore, they are compelled to overuse and misuse antibiotics. Irrational use of antibiotics helps to breed resistant bacteria that lead to antimicrobial drug resistance, an increasingly scary problem here. Procuring out-of-specification and substandard medicines at any price is too expensive. This adds to a widespread perception that government medicines are of low quality. Corruption in Nepal has deep, complex roots in the social, cultural, economic and political systems. Hence, there are no easy ways to win over it; rather it requires in-depth research and thorough analysis. Increasing salary and social security for government employees could help. Integrating awareness about anti-corruption laws and the detrimental effects of corruption in the school curriculum might produce honest and accountable citizens.
In October 2018, the government required civil servants to take an oath every day: ‘I will not indulge in corruption, I will prevent corruption and will honestly work for my country and people.’ But, I argue decision-makers urgently need to move beyond such ineffective anti-corruption measures. We need better regulation and monitoring, and effective penalties. Strong action against corrupt officials should take priority without political bias. Zero tolerance against corrupt practices by both healthcare providers and consumers, and policies to protect whistleblowers are equally important.
Tackling corruption in the health system is difficult, but not impossible. The responsibility to tackle corruption does not belong only to the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority. The Nepal Medical Association, National Human Rights Commission and trade unions should also play a proactive role in the enactment of such laws for transparency and accountability in healthcare.
Media engagement is equally important. Media should not be limited to the information provided by the anti-corruption bodies; rather it should do more investigative journalism to uncover deep-rooted corruption in the health system. Recently, Nepali media set a global example by covering the story of district health officials who pocketed cash allowances by creating a list of fake mothers.
Life is precious. Quality healthcare is a human right. Corruption in health care is neither normal nor acceptable; it is a crime.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/change-has-to-start-from-you/,"Once when my sister-in-law and I had some misunderstanding, my brother told me that I should change my thinking. Well, it was a shock to me. It took me some time to come out of it until I attended a life skills training programme.
In the journey of life, we are so accustomed to seeing, hearing and imbibing the weakness of others that it has become a natural habit. Despite making resolutions not to see the fault of others, we tend to repeat it. My father always points faults at my mother and me, but I always thought that at some point in the future he would change. We always say we shouldn’t do this or that, but what we should do, think or see cannot happen naturally.
For instance, if some empty place is not used properly, then it gives birth to junk and mosquitoes. The environment already has dirt, dust and mosquitoes. The empty place will be filled.
Similarly, if we transform and try to see, listen and imbibe everyone’s virtues, duties, belief systems, occupations and intentions, then impurity will end by itself.
Sometimes by looking at the mistakes of others, I would think they won’t change. However, that change has to start with me. And the way to do it is to see myself from the point of my specialty.
For example, as a writer, I will perceive everything from the writer’s point of view of experiencing something new. As a motivational speaker, I will see what mistakes are generally committed or what new things I can learn from others in public speaking. If I see myself from the specialty of the self, it becomes easy to see others from the view of their specialties.
Others do presume on the basis of their specialties and experiences rather than from our perspective.  This is how the unoccupied place gets filled up. It’s like celebrating the festival of Holi by burning the old belief system and creating a new one.  Instead of thinking someone is not going to change, we can ask ourselves, have I changed myself?  Let me become an example of transforming the self, which is like burning the demon Holi.
Burning things means we have to come clean and pure from our old belief systems. It gives immense happiness when we change rather than wait for others to change.
Life is full of challenges, and everyone grows with experience. Let’s help ourselves, inspire ourselves to change, which will ultimately help others to see and change.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/translational-research-a-new-paradigm-in-nepal/,"But, this apparently simple solution must be carefully planned as the spectrum of research contains myriad forms of studies 
Research is an integral part of human development, and a nation’s participation in the promotion of this institute reflects the political will to propel itself towards progress. The last decade has seen a boost in Nepal’s involvement in research.
This has prompted the Nepal Health Research Council, the apex body for research in the country, to recognise research as a means of human development.
Following this, a new wave of zeal was experienced, with indigenous researchers working both within and outside the country to strengthen the foundation.

Translational research has begun to emerge in Nepal as a novel venture. This emergence is, however, still in the distant horizon, owing to the limited understanding of this brand of research among professionals, including academic researchers. Robust training and knowledge dissemination would educate and prepare the researchers and hone their skills. However, this apparently simple solution must be carefully planned and executed efficiently as the spectrum of research contains myriad forms of studies.
Equally pertinent is evaluation of the success of translational research. It must be flexible enough to accommodate the needs of individual institutions and trainees with outcome promising the parameters of excellence.
The transfer of new scientific discoveries into healthcare interventions has always been a challenge.
Although this era has made communication accessible, relevant data needs channeling. A strong translational team is required to achieve this and to extend beyond the academic environment. To succinctly summarise, I want to quote the great scientist and Nobel Prize winner, Professor Bernard Lown, who said that “Once a new paradigm holds, its acceptance is extra-ordinarily rapid, and one finds few who claim to have adhered to a discarded method.”
We need to make translational research this new paradigm. This new integrated model in Nepal will help increase healthcare effectiveness.
One of the significant landmarks the country has achieved in the field of research arena is winning theT32 grant for “Translational research capacity building initiative to address cardiovascular disease in Nepal”, funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, USA.
This is an inspiring example of Nepali researchers utilising their training from abroad and capitalising on their country’s policy of research development. Although a few academicians, clinicians and traditional researchers may perceive this project as a mere foreign donor investment to westernise the research culture in Nepal, the prudent and passionate ones view this as an opportunity to upgrade our systems, which would expedite holistic development.
Another area worth exploring is the thought put in by the brilliant minds in writing theT32 grant, which addresses the leading cause of death globally and in Nepal, “the deadly cardio vascular diseases” (CVDs), which again will invest in finding out the root cause of human mortality in the local context.
A multi-faceted, multi-sectoral synergistic effort is the need of the hour for the sustainable uptake of evidence-based interventions in routine clinical and community-based settings and to develop feasible implementation strategies for contextually appropriate evidence-based interventions.
These strategies will ultimately prevent premature mortality and give leverage to the Ministry of Health and Population to address this deadly epidemic with robust evidence.
Challenges for human development will always exist in the fragile public health system of Nepal where corruption, nepotism are rampant along with a weak bureaucracy.
The challenges of implementing translational research project could be argued in two ways: Internal and external challenges.
Internally, although a handful of researchers working in this project are trained abroad and possess skills to judiciously invest such a considerable grant, quite a few of the co-investigators, fellows, research assistants and other administrative and financial staff are ill-equipped. The pertinent reason being the stark difference between the superior facilities of the westernised world versus the low resource settings of Nepal. We can further break the internal challenges into: a) difference in education and training b); weak culture of grooming and absence of a good mentor-mentee relationship; c) lack of expertise in the required field; d) inexperience with big grants; and f) inefficient time management. Also, competing priorities for survival and financial motivation in the weak health system of the country are always hidden agendas.
Externally, translational research should move beyond academic environment as crossing boundaries brings about new challenges along with ideas that evolve the process. However, the lack of familiarity of this concept within different health institutions and higher authorities, very few trained personnel trained at the authority level, poor research infrastructure and uncertain priorities are some of the evident challenges at the national level.
However, the challenges can be overcome.This adage sums up my conditions for tackling troubles: “Great things happen to those who don’t stop believing, trying, learning and being grateful.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-sapkotas-challenges/,"The ruling party should have reconsidered Sapkota’s candidacy as Speaker given his murky past and that his case is sub-judice in court 
As the main opposition Nepali Congress did not field its candidacy for the post of Speaker, Nepal Communist Party (NCP) lawmaker Agni Prasad Sapkota was elected unopposed Speaker of the House of Representatives on Sunday. He also took the oath of office and secrecy from President Bidhya Devi Bhandari on Monday, even as members of the civil society and rights activists protested against his election to the post in front of the presidential office, Sital Niwas. Over a dozen rights activists were briefly detained when he was taking the oath of office and secrecy. With Sapkota’s election as the Speaker, the four-month-long uncertainty is now over, but the days ahead are challenging for him and his party that decided to field his candidature for the post, which demands independence and impartiality in running the House. The post had remained vacant since October 1 last year after then Speaker KB Mahara put in his papers on charges of attempt to rape a female employee at the Parliament Secretariat. Sapkota, who is a close confidante of NCP chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, was chosen as the candidate for the post despite strong reservations by another NCP chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli over his nomination.
The NCP leadership, which is never tired of talking about promoting women in leadership positions, had forced Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe to step down so that Sapkota could be elected to the post. She might have been the right choice to lead the House given her long political and academic career. She, however, was made a scapegoat of the crime committed by someone else. Without her resignation, it was not constitutionally possible to elect Sapokota as the House speaker. Shortly after her resignation as deputy speaker, she rightly summed up the party’s mindset: “Patriarchy is stronger (in the party) than monarchy”.
Now, we have a speaker who has been elected unopposed. But it cannot make up for everything that has gone wrong. Sapkota has a tainted history for crimes committed during the decade-long armed conflict. A case is sub-judice in the Supreme Court on charges of his alleged involvement in abducting and killing Arjun Lama of Kavre in 2005. What if he is found guilty of killing Lama? International rights bodies have also expressed serious concerns over his election to the post, fearing that the conflict victims would not get justice because of his presence in the constitutional council that makes appointments in the state organs as an ex-officio member. Although the main opposition raised concerns that he might not play an impartial role in the House and bring all the parties together on national issues given his murky past, just like what Mahara did during his tenure, the NC committed a blunder by giving in to the wishes of the ruling party. The opposition’s role looks very feeble in this case. The ruling party should also have reconsidered Sapkota’s candidacy considering all these bare facts and the clamour by the rights activists. However, time will tell whether he will run the House without showing bias against the opposition or without being under the shadow of the executive that always wants the Speaker to dance to its tune.

Don’t take blast lightly
The government cannot take the blast carried out at the project site of the Arun III Hydropower Project on Saturday lightly. The pressure cooker bomb that was detonated by an unidentified group has damaged the generator of the 900-MW power project that is under construction in Sankhuwasabha. This is not the first time such bomb attacks have taken place against projects with foreign investment, and they are happening far too often, making investors jittery. The bomb attacks are taking place under one pretext or the other; however, the ultimate aim is extortion.
Nepal has held a series of investment summits in recent years to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). And the least the government can do to show its seriousness in attracting FDI is to provide security to the projects that have foreign equity. Doing business in Nepal is difficult largely because of the cumbersome process in starting a venture and thereafter having to deal with groups, often politically tainted, in the countryside that are hostile to projects approved by the centre or the provinces. There is no way other than to deal harshly with such groups that pose obstacles to projects, if the country wants to attract FDI.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/saturn-and-sade-sati/,"Saturn’s transit ‘gochara’ in the sign of Capricorn on January 24 begins the Sade-sati for those born under the Aquarius moon sign. This day ends the Sade-sati for Scorpio and begins the last phase of the Sade-sati for Sagittarius.
Since 2017, Saturn has been transiting in the sign of Sagittarius.
Saturn, or Shani, is a slow-moving planet and stays in one zodiac sign for about two-and-a-half years, hence, astrologically, the impact of Saturn’s transit is felt strongly over an individual’s life.
Sade-sati is considered to be in operation in one’s life when Saturn transits in the sign before, on and after the sign of your natal moon. Sade-sati, a period of seven and half years, is the sum of the transit periods of these three consecutive signs for approximately two-and-ahalf years each.
Saturn’s transit in the sign 12th from your moon is the starting period of Sade-sati, also called the rising phase. The most crucial phase is when Saturn is in the same sign as the moon, known as the peak phase, and the final phase, called the setting of Sade-sati, is when Saturn is transiting in the sign 2nd from your moon.
To correctly analyse the impact of Sade-sati, it is important to understand the placement of Saturn, its aspect in one’s birth chart and also the planetary dasha that the individual is currently experiencing.
Sade-sati, the most intriguing and intimidating phenomenon in astrology, is dubiously associated with difficulties and challenges and popularly considered as a negative phase.
However, it is the period in an individual’s life when Saturn, the hard taskmaster, checks one’s capacity to endure hardships, tests one’s patience, integrity and perseverance. One will find it difficult to achieve success in this period as one may not get the desired results instantly.
However, Saturn, the planet of karma, delays but does not deny. Hence, your good deeds will be rewarded eventually. So do your best and leave the rest.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/novel-coronavirus-scare-boost-surveillance-at-tia/,"There is no need to panic over this novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV because its mortality rate is about 2 per cent, which is far less compared to the MERS and SARS coronaviruses. Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the potential of this virus 
On January 13, a 31-yearold, previously healthy male was admitted to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) after his return from Wuhan, China. He was suffering from fever and had difficulty breathing and cough. These symptoms are similar to those who died of pneumonia of an unknown origin in Wuhan. The causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was later identified as the novel coronavirus, and scientifically denoted as “2019-nCoV”.
Wuhan city is believed to be the epicentre of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. According to media reports, 41 people have died due to its complications in China, and the number of infected people worldwide is said to have reached almost 1300.
With the celebration of 2020 as Visit Nepal Year and growing number of travellers to and from China, it is a wake-up call for Nepal to establish effective preparedness and response programmes against this novel coronavirus.

Coronaviruses are zoonotic, which cause illness ranging from a mild common cold to more severe diseases, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). MERS-CoV is mainly reported in the Middle East countries, Saudi Arabia in particular.
Dromedary camels are believed to be a major reservoir of this virus. The overall case fatality rate of MERS-CoV is approximately 35 per cent. Human-to-human transmission is possible but limited.
Middle East countries are a favourite destination for Nepali migrant workers, therefore, the risk of contracting this virus and spreading it to vulnerable people in Nepal is possible.
However, Nepal lacks testing equipment/kits or does not include it in a routine laboratory test. Even physicians do not consider this disease in the differential diagnosis.
In fact, reports show that every year thousands of patients die due to pneumonia of unknown origin in Nepal. A recent study conducted in Nepal showed that 8 per cent of infants (first 6 months of life), who experienced acute respiratory illness, suffered from human coronavirus.
It shows that human coronavirus is not a new disease in Nepal.
Another notable life-threatening coronavirus is known as SARS-CoV, which was first identified in 2002-2003 in Guangdong, China. It was reported in 37 countries across the world, infecting more than 8,000, resulting in 774 deaths. During that time, I was working as a medical officer at the STIDH and had been involved in the investigations of several suspected SARS-CoV patients carried out by the hospital.
Genetic sequencing of this novel coronavirus virus shows homology of only 73 per cent to SARS-CoV, meaning this novel coronavirus “2019-nCoV” is genetically distinct from existing human coronaviruses. So far, its symptoms include mainly fever and difficulty in breathing, resulting in severe acute respiratory syndrome and even death.
A Nepali citizen, who returned from Wuhan, China, was kept under close observation at the STIDH, after displaying fever and difficulty in breathing. In fact, he showed these symptoms before his departure from Wuhan. It is fortunate that his chest x-ray showed no sign of pneumonia.
According to WHO case definition, it can be regarded as a suspected case of novel coronavirus 2019- nCoV. Usually cough triggers breathing difficulties, but conversely, he complained of cough followed by difficulty in breathing.
He denied having visited any seafood or live animal market in Wuhan, indicating that this virus may have the capability to spread from human to human. In fact, very recently, the health authority in China confirmed human-to-human transmission, revealing 14 cases of transmission to healthcare providers, prompting hospital staff safety concerns.
To date, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the US have reported imported cases of 2019-nCoV in their respective countries.
However, no casualties related to this virus have been reported. Many countries are stepping up measures, such as strengthening the surveillance system at their ports of entry to prevent 2019- nCoV from entering their respective countries.
Nepal, being a close neighbour of China, must step up a screening process at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA). A health desk was set up at the airport during the Ebola epidemic in Africa. It has, however, not been fully functioning as it lacks the required human resource, high-tech support, such as thermal scanners, and limited space and infrastructure.
Such resources are most urgent and must be made available as early as possible because WHO is expected to declare this novel coronavirus 2019- nCoV, as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
At present, there is no need to panic over this novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV because its mortality rate is approximately 2 per cent, which is far less compared to the MERS and SARS coronaviruses. Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the potential of this virus, because, at this moment,very little is known about this virus.
In another words, it is still unclear about its exact origin, behaviour, spectrum of disease, dynamic transmission, morbidity and mortality rate, and, more importantly, its possible consequences for Nepal.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-bicycle-dream/,"People know very well that the bicycle is environment-friendly and that cycling is good for one’s health, but that alone will not help promote it 
Given the short distances between two destinations in Kathmandu, cycling should have been the best means for getting around. Unfortunately, the bicycles that once plied the streets of the capital in large numbers have been replaced by an ever-growing number of motorcycles…and cars, jamming the streets day in day out, to the utter chagrin of its inhabitants. Today in this city swamped by vehicles that run on fossil fuels, big and small, the bicycle has become a pariah. But Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) and Lalitpur Metropolitan City (LMC) now seem resolute to dedicate cycle lanes along certain road stretches for a start so that the city can become more cycle-friendly with the passage of time. The KMC’s bike lane stretches from the Maitighar Mandala till Tinkune, while the LMC cycle lane starts at Kupondole and ends at Mangal Bazaar. The plans, however, are not new – they were taken up years ago. But like most plans and projects in Nepal, the two schemes lost steam mid-way, and both the authorities and the cyclists are unsure if the lanes even exist.
There are many reasons why cycling has lost favour among the inhabitants in the Kathmandu Valley. People know very well that the bicycle is environment-friendly and that cycling is good for one’s health, but it is unlikely that they will take to cycling unless the municipalities can take measures to make the cities cycle-friendly. Kathmandu may not be a very big city, but it is not flat land like the Tarai plains. The roads of the capital have too many steep climbs at regular intervals that could easily tire a cyclist. That would not have been so bad if only the roads were in shape. Most roads are faulty in design and shoddy in construction with potholes everywhere, requiring the cyclist to dodge them every now and then. And, of course, the traffic congestion, dust and pollution everywhere do not make cycling a very pleasant experience.
Despite the odds, can the cycle still be promoted in the capital? If the past is any guide, the Indian blockade in 1988, which lasted until the ushering in of multi-party democracy in 1990, literally put everyone on a bicycle. With an acute shortage of petrol and diesel in the market, sales of bicycles grew by leaps and bounds. But with the end of the blockade, people forgot just handy a bicycle really is. But if the municipalities are really serious about promoting cycling and will not yield to half-hearted measures as in the past, there is still hope that the bicycle can bounce back and be a sustainable form of mobility. To begin with, this will require dedicated cycle lanes that are the prerogative of the cyclists and cyclists alone. The Traffic Police have the onus to see to it that the lanes are not encroached by other forms of vehicles as the safety of the cyclist is of primary concern. This is a real challenge in a city where reckless drivers are not used to following lane discipline. Let us hope the proposed cycle lanes are not meant solely to appease a few cycling enthusiasts. Committed action by the authorities for planned urban space will go a long way in creating a cycle-friendly city.

Charging stations
As the state-owned power utility, Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), is going to have surplus energy in its grid from the end of this fiscal, it has come up with a plan to install charging stations across the country. Initially, the NEA plans to set up 50 charging stations in Kathmandu, Narayangadh, Butwal, Itahari, Biratnagar, Pokhara, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Damak and on other inter-city routes. The main objective of the plan is to increase the use of EVs and reduce the import bill of fossil fuels, for which Nepal spends billions of rupees every year. The money saved thus from the import of fossil fuel can also be used to make more investment in clean energy projects, such as wind, solar and hydroelectricity.
For this, the NEA recently called a global tender for the installation of 50 charging stations as per its plan in September last year. A charging station should be able to charge at least three EVs at a time with ample space. A successful bidder will have to complete the construction works within six months from the date the tender is awarded. Once this plan comes into full operation, it will encourage people to switch to EVs, which will contribute in controling the rising air pollution.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/have-a-safe-journey-2/,"Many years ago, as I was preparing to go to work in the morning, my phone rang. I picked up the phone and said politely ‘hello’ a couple of times.
There was total silence at the other end. It just took a flash of a second to figure out that it was a trunk call as long-distance phones are known. After some time I could hear my friend LP at the other end. He was coming to Kathmandu from the US via Pakistan.
I asked him, “Why Pakistan?”
He didn’t mince his words: “Your bhauju has fallen for a tour guide in Pakistan. We are getting a divorce.” I remember his wife as a nice lady. But there was not much I could say to empathise with him on his divorce, a personal issue. As it is, times were hard with a memorable blockade in place, ostensibly to force King Birendra to give in to democratic forces.
LP wanted to know if I would be in town at the end of September.
I was heading to Singapore for a few days, but I told him I would be back in time to pick him up from the airport.
He wanted to come home for an authentic Newari dinner and talk about our business project. We planned to open an office in the US.
During his earlier trips, we had agreed on the ToR that he would take care of the business and ensure profitability. I had told him that I don’t fancy leaving Nepal to settle elsewhere.
My American friend, Robert, had instilled pride in my roots.
He used to come home for drinks whenever he was in town. Warning me against moving to the US, he would tell me, “You have strong roots here.”
On the day LP was flying in, the sky was overcast and cloudy.
We had some drizzle during the day. The rains had not petered out even though it was the tail end of the monsoon. My assistant gave me the news: “Are you expecting someone? The PIA flight is missing.”
Suddenly an unknown fear seized me. As I waited with butterflies in my stomach, the inevitable news came in shortly.
The flight crashed. A Thai flight mishap barely a month ago had killed 113 passengers. Two international flight accidents in the space of a month. I went home and wept.
What was prescient were my words. Without any thoughts, I had warned LP that he might die in an air accident. He had told me over the long-distance phone: “Don’t worry, man, PIA is one of the best airlines and has never crashed except once, a long time ago.” What words! Since then, I wish everyone a safe journey but not a safe flight.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-astronaut-christina-koch-returns-to-earth-after-record-mission/,"WASHINGTON: US astronaut Christina Koch, who led the first all-female spacewalk in 2019, landed in Kazakhstan on Thursday after a record stay on the International Space Station, ending a 328-day mission expected to yield new insights into deep-space travel.

The Soyuz MS-13 capsule touched down on the Kazakh desert steppe at 4:12 am ET carrying Koch, 41, European astronaut Luca Parmitano and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov.

Koch’s mission broke the record for the longest continuous stay in space by a woman, previously held by NASA’s Peggy Whitson.
She also achieved a gender milestone in a relatively routine spacewalk with fellow NASA astronaut Jessica Meir last October that marked the first time two women stepped out of the space station at the same time.
NASA’s first attempt for an all-female spacewalk in March 2019 was called off because one of the astronauts’ medium-sized spacesuits was not properly configured in advance, igniting a gender-equity debate within the space community.
Astronauts on the space station, whose 20th anniversary in low-Earth orbit comes later this year, have tallied 227 maintenance spacewalks, nearly two dozen of which included women astronauts, according to NASA. Koch and Meir conducted two more spacewalks together in January.
NASA said Koch’s lengthy mission will provide researchers with much-needed data on how the weightlessness of gravity and space radiation affects the female body on long-duration spaceflights.
That science, to be studied in the coming months, could prove useful for the US space agency’s aim of building a permanent space station on the moon’s surface within the next decade.
US astronaut Scott Kelly’s 340 days in orbit starting in 2015 demonstrated that long-term spaceflight causes human health effects such as thickening of the carotid artery and retina, changes in gene expression and slight cognitive impairment for men.
Launched into orbit last March, Koch’s mission was extended in April from its original span of six months to nearly a year after she was already aboard the station.

They show the surface covered with bright cell-like areas, each about the size of Texas, that result from the transporting of heat from the sun’s interior. The telescope can reveal features as small as 18 miles (30 km) across, according to the National Science Foundation, which released the images Wednesday.
Further observations will help scientists understand and predict solar activity that can disrupt satellite communications and affect power grids, the foundation said. The telescope is on the island of Maui.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/australia-scientists-claim-first-re-creation-of-coronavirus-outside-china/,"SYDNEY: A team of scientists in Australia said on Wednesday they have successfully developed a lab-grown version of coronavirus, the first to be recreated outside of China, in a breakthrough that could help combat the global spread of the illness.
The researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne said they would share the sample, which was grown from an infected patient, with the World Health Organization and laboratories around the world.

A laboratory in China had successfully grown the virus but had released only the genome sequence, not the sample itself, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.
“Having the real virus means we now have the ability to actually validate and verify all test methods, and compare their sensitivities and specificities”, the Doherty Institute’s virus indentification laboratory head, Julian Druce, said in a statement.
“The virus will be used as positive control material for the Australian network of public health laboratories, and also shipped to expert laboratories working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe.”
The flu-like virus broke out in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year and has killed 106 people and infected more than 2,800 people. It spreads in droplets from coughs and sneezes and has an incubation period of up to 14 days.
The Australia-grown virus sample would be used to generate an antibody test, which would allow detection of the virus in patients who had not shown symptoms, as well as contributing to the creation of a vaccine, the institute said.
The virus was grown from a patient who had arrived at the institute on Jan. 24, it added.
The Peter Doherty Institute is a joint venture of the University of Melbourne and Royal Melbourne Hospital.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/did-asteroid-that-hit-australia-help-thaw-ancient-snowball-earth/,"It is curious to think of an asteroid impact shifting the Earth’s atmosphere to something more clement for life than a ‘snowball’ scenario: Timmons Erickson, a NASA research scientist
WASHINGTON: Scientists have identified Earth’s oldest-known impact crater, and in doing so may have solved a mystery about how our planet emerged from one of its most dire periods.
Researchers have determined that the 45-mile-wide (70-km-wide) Yarrabubba crater in Australia formed when an asteroid struck Earth just over 2.2 billion years ago. The collision occurred at a time when the planet was believed to have been encased in ice and the impact may have driven climate warming that led to a global thaw.

“Looking at our planet from space, it would have looked very different,” said isotope geology professor Chris Kirkland of Curtin University in Australia, one of the researchers in the study published in the journal Nature Communications. “… You would see a white ball, not our familiar blue marble.”
The researchers suspect the region was covered in an ice sheet up to 3 miles (5 km) thick at the time. They calculated that the violent asteroid strike may have transformed immense amounts of ice into water vapour – sending perhaps 200 billion tons of it billowing into the atmosphere. It would have served as a greenhouse gas trapping heat in the atmosphere.
The researchers are wondering whether this thaw helped shepherd Earth into a climate more favourable for the simple microbes that inhabited the planet at the time to thrive and evolve, possibly making it a pivotal event in the history of life on Earth.
The planet descended into one of its two primordial “snowball Earth” periods 2.4 billion years ago amid a rise in oxygen in an atmosphere formerly dominated by methane and carbon dioxide. The asteroid, estimated at 4-1/2 miles (7 km) wide, landed at Yarrabubba in the state of Western Australia, coinciding with the end of the deep freeze.
“During the time of the Yarrabubba impact, life was more simple but did contain organisms like stromatolites, algal mounds that are still in existence today,” said study lead author Timmons Erickson, a NASA research scientist at the Johnson Space Center’s Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science division.
“It is curious to think of an asteroid impact shifting the Earth’s atmosphere to something more clement for life than a ‘snowball’ scenario,” Erickson added.
The researchers determined the crater’s age by examining tiny crystals of the minerals monazite and zircon formed in the asteroid impact.
Earth has been hit by space rocks many times since it formed 4.5 billion years ago. For example, an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. But the inexorable movement of Earth’s tectonic plates and surface erosion have erased most of the oldest craters. Until now, the oldest-known impact crater was one in South Africa with a diameter of more than 120 miles (200 km) that formed just over 2 billion years old.
The other “snowball Earth” period lasted from 700 million to 600 million years ago.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/spacex-says-picture-perfect-test-paves-way-for-human-mission/,"CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA: Elon Musk’s SpaceX simulated a successful emergency landing on Sunday in a dramatic test of a crucial abort system on an unmanned astronaut capsule, a big step its mission to fly NASA astronauts for the first time as soon as this spring.
A Crew Dragon astronaut capsule launched at 10:30 a.m. and softly splashed down about 19 miles (32 km) off the coast of Cape Canaveral in Florida about eight minutes later, after ejecting itself from a rocket that cut off its engines 12 miles (19 km) above the ocean to mimic a launch failure.
Crew Dragon detached from the Falcon 9 rocket at “more than double the speed of sound,” Musk told reporters, at 131,000 feet (40km) above the Atlantic Ocean — roughly twice the altitude of a commercial jetliner.
“It is a picture perfect mission. It went as well as one can possibly expect,” Musk said at a press conference.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration administrator Jim Bridenstine also described the test as a success.
The first mission with humans aboard, which will be the final test mission before NASA’s commercial crew program becomes operational, is scheduled for the second quarter of this year, after the spacecraft is completed no later than March, Musk said.
In what was a key trial ahead of carrying humans, SpaceX also tested its rescue teams’ response after splash down. They scrambled toward Crew Dragon with the US Air Force’s Detachment 3 emergency rescue teams in tow — a vital part of the test to practice a rescue mission to retrieve astronauts from the capsule.
Crew Dragon, an acorn-shaped pod that can seat seven astronauts, fired on-board thrusters to detach itself from the rocket less than two minutes after liftoff, simulating an emergency abort scenario to prove it can return astronauts to safety. Each stage of the test prompted loud cheers from SpaceX crew members watching the footage from back on land.
The test is crucial to qualify the capsule to fly humans to the International Space Station, something NASA expects to come as soon as mid-2020. It follows years of development and delays as the United States has sought to revive its human spaceflight program through private partnerships.
NASA awarded $4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.5 billion to SpaceX in 2014 to develop separate capsule systems capable of ferrying astronauts to the space station from US soil for the first time since NASA’s space shuttle program ended in 2011. The space agency has since relied on Russian spacecraft for rides to the space station. During the test Crew Dragon used its so-called SuperDraco thrusters to jet itself away from the rocket at supersonic speeds of up to 1,500 miles per hour (2,400 kph). The Falcon 9 booster free-fell back to the ocean, with its first stage crashing into the waves and creating a tall plume of smoke seen on the horizon.
The capsule deployed four parachutes to slow its descent, and carried two human-shaped test dummies on seats fitted with motion sensors to collect data on the immense g-force — the effect of acceleration on the body — astronauts would be subjected to during abort.
The test was originally scheduled for mid-2019 but was delayed after a Crew Dragon capsule exploded in April on a test stand just before firing its launch abort thrusters, triggering a lengthy investigation.
SpaceX-led investigators in July zeroed in on a previously unknown explosive reaction between a titanium valve and a propellant used to ignite the thrusters. A SpaceX official said the company completed the investigation within the last week.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nations-dawdle-on-agreeing-rules-to-control-killer-robots-in-future-wars/,"NAIROBI: Countries are rapidly developing “killer robots” – machines with artificial intelligence (AI) that independently kill – but are moving at a snail’s pace on agreeing global rules over their use in future wars, warn technology and human rights experts.
From drones and missiles to tanks and submarines, semi-autonomous weapons systems have been used for decades to eliminate targets in modern day warfare – but they all have human supervision.
Nations such as the United States, Russia and Israel are now investing in developing lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) which can identify, target, and kill a person all on their own – but to date there are no international laws governing their use.
“Some kind of human control is necessary … Only humans can make context-specific judgements of distinction, proportionality and precautions in combat,” said Peter Maurer, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
“(Building consensus) is the big issue we are dealing with and unsurprisingly, those who have today invested a lot of capacities and do have certain skill which promise advantages to them, are more reluctant than those who don’t.”
The ICRC oversaw the adoption of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that define the laws of war and the rights of civilians to protection and assistance during conflicts and it engages with governments to adapt these rules to modern warfare.
AI researchers, defence analysts and roboticists say LAWS such as military robots are no longer confined to the realm of science fiction or video games, but are fast progressing from graphic design boards to defence engineering laboratories.
Within a few years, they could be deployed by state militaries to the battlefield, they add, painting dystopian scenarios of swarms of drones moving through a town or city, scanning and selectively killing their targets within seconds.
DEATH BY ALGORITHM
This has raised ethical concerns from human rights groups and some tech experts who say giving machines the power of life and death violates the principles of human dignity.
Not only are LAWS vulnerable to interference and hacking which would result in increased civilian deaths, they add, but their deployment would raise questions over who would be held accountable in the event of misuse.
“Don’t be mistaken by the nonsense of how intelligent these weapons will be,” said Noel Sharkey, chairman of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control.
“You simply can’t trust an algorithm – no matter how smart – to seek out, identify and kill the correct target, especially in the complexity of war,” said Sharkey, who is also an AI and robotics expert at Britain’s University of Sheffield.
Experts in defence-based AI systems argue such weapons, if developed well, can make war more humane.
They will be more precise and efficient, not fall prey to human emotions such as fear or vengeance and minimise deaths of civilians and soldiers, they add.
“From a military’s perspective, the primary concern is to protect the security of the country with the least amount of lives lost – and that means its soldiers,” said Anuj Sharma, chairman of India Research Centre, which works on AI warfare.
“So if you can remove the human out of the equation as much as possible, it’s a win because it means less body bags going back home – and that’s what everyone wants.”
AVOIDABLE TRAGEDY
A 2019 survey by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a global coalition, found 61% of people across 26 countries, including the United States and Israel, opposed the development of fully autonomous lethal weapons.
Mary Wareham, HRW’s arms division advocacy director, said countries have held eight meetings under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons since 2014 to discuss the issue, but there has been no progress.
Thirty nations including Brazil, Austria and Canada are in favour of a total ban, while dozens of others want a treaty to establish some form of control over the use of LAWS, said Wareham, also coordinator of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots.
This is largely due to a few, powerful nations like the United States and Russia who say it is premature to move towards regulation, without first defining such weapons, she said.
The US State Department said it supported the discussions at the UN, but that “dictating a particular format for an outcome before working through the substance” would not result in the best outcome.
“The United States has opposed calls to develop a ban and does not support opening negotiations, whether on a legally binding instrument or a political declaration, at this time,” said a US state department spokesperson in a statement.
“We must not be anti-technology and must be cautious not to make hasty judgments about emerging or future technologies especially given how ‘smart’ precision-guided weapons have allowed responsible militaries to reduce risks to civilians in military operations,” it added.
Officials from Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“It’s not good enough that we moving forward into the 21st century without set rules,” said Wareham, adding that without oversight, more nations would develop lethal autonomous weapons.
“We need to have a new international treaty as we have for landmines and cluster munitions. We have to prevent the avoidable tragedy that is coming if we do not regulate our killer robots.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/deep-sea-microbe-sheds-light-on-primordial-evolutionary-milestone/,"WASHINGTON: A microorganism scooped up in deep–sea mud off Japan’s coast has helped scientists unlock the mystery of one of the watershed evolutionary events for life on Earth: the transition from the simple cells that first colonised the planet to complex cellular life – fungi, plants and animals including people.
Researchers said on Wednesday they were able to study the biology of the microorganism, retrieved from depths of about 1.5 miles (2.5 km), after coaxing it to grow in the laboratory. They named it Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum, referring to the Greek mythological figure Prometheus who created humankind from clay and stole fire from the gods.


Prometheoarchaeum’s spherical cell – with a diameter of roughly 500 nanometers, or one-20,000th of a centimeter – boasts long, often branching tentacle-like appendages on its outer surface.
It is part of a group called Archaea, relatively simple single-cell organisms lacking internal structures such as a nucleus. Scientists have long puzzled over the evolutionary shift from such simple bacteria-like cells to the first rudimentary fungi, plants and animals – a group called eukaryotes – perhaps 2 billion years ago.
Based on a painstaking laboratory study of Prometheoarchaeum and observations of its symbiotic – mutually beneficial – relationship with a companion bacterium, the researchers offered an explanation.
They proposed that appendages like those of Prometheoarchaeum entangled a passing bacterium, which was then engulfed and eventually evolved into an organelle – internal structure – called a mitochondrion that is the powerhouse of a cell and crucial for respiration and energy production.
The solar system including Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago. The first life on Earth, simple marine microbes, appeared roughly 4 billion years ago. The later advent of eukaryotes set in motion evolutionary paths that led to a riotous assemblage of organisms over the eons like palm trees, blue whales, T. rex, hummingbirds, clownfish, shiitake mushrooms, lobsters, daisies, woolly mammoths and Marilyn Monroe.
“How we – as eukaryotes – originated is a fundamental question related to how we – as humans – came to be,” said microbiologist Masaru Nobu of Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, one of the leaders of the study published in the journal Nature.
Prometheoarchaeum is a member of a subgroup called Asgard archaea – named for the dwelling place of the gods in Norse mythology. Other members of this subgroup were retrieved from the frigid seabed near a hydrothermal vent system called Loki’s Castle, named after a Norse mythological figure, between Greenland and Norway.
The research on Prometheoarchaeum, Nobu said, indicates that the Asgard archaea are the closest living relatives to the first eukaryotes.
The researchers used a submersible research vessel to collect mud containing Prometheoarchaeum from the Omine Ridge off Japan in 2006. They studied it in the laboratory in a years-long process and watched it slowly proliferate after incubating the samples in a vessel infused with methane gas to simulate the deep–sea marine sediment environment in which it resides.
“We were able to obtain the first complete genome of this group of archaea and conclusively show that these archaea possess many genes that had been thought to be only found in eukaryotes,” Nobu said.
Prometheoarchaeum was found to be reliant on its companion bacterium.
“The organism ‘eats’ amino acids through symbiosis with a partner,” Nobu said. “This is because the organism can neither fully digest amino acids by itself, gain energy if any byproducts have accumulated, nor build its own cell without external help.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nsa-finds-major-security-flaw-in-windows-10-free-fix-issued/,"The National Security Agency has discovered a major security flaw in Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system that could let hackers intercept seemingly secure communications.
But rather than exploit the flaw for its own intelligence needs, the NSA tipped off Microsoft so that it can fix the system for everyone.
Microsoft released a free software patch to fix the flaw Tuesday and credited the intelligence agency for discovering it. The company said it has not seen any evidence that hackers have used the technique.
Amit Yoran, CEO of security firm Tenable, said it is “exceptionally rare if not unprecedented” for the US government to share its discovery of such a critical vulnerability with a company.
Yoran, who was a founding director of the Department of Homeland Security’s computer emergency readiness team, urged all organizations to prioritize patching their systems quickly.
An advisory sent by the NSA on Tuesday said “the consequences of not patching the vulnerability are severe and widespread.”
Microsoft said an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by spoofing a code-signing certificate so it looked like a file came from a trusted source.
“The user would have no way of knowing the file was malicious, because the digital signature would appear to be from a trusted provider,” the company said.
If successfully exploited, attackers would have been able to conduct “man-in-the-middle attacks” and decrypt confidential information they intercept on user connections, the company said.
“The biggest risk is to secure communications,” said Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence for security firm CrowdStrike.
Some computers will get the fix automatically, if they have the automatic update option turned on. Others can get it manually by going to Windows Update in the computer’s settings.
Microsoft typically releases security and other updates once a month and waited until Tuesday to disclose the flaw and the NSA’s involvement. Microsoft and the NSA both declined to say when the agency privately notified the company.
The agency shared the vulnerability with Microsoft “quickly and responsibly,” Neal Ziring, technical director of the NSA’s cybersecurity directorate, said in a blog post Tuesday.
Priscilla Moriuchi, who retired from the NSA in 2017 after running its East Asia and Pacific operations, said this is a good example of the “constructive role” that the NSA can play in improving global information security. Moriuchi, now an analyst at the US cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said it’s likely a reflection of changes made in 2017 to how the US determines whether to disclose a major vulnerability or exploit it for intelligence purposes.
The revamping of what’s known as the “Vulnerability Equities Process” put more emphasis on disclosing vulnerabilities whenever possible to protect core internet systems and the US economy and general public.
Those changes happened after a mysterious group calling itself the “Shadow Brokers” released a trove of high-level hacking tools stolen from the NSA, forcing companies including Microsoft to repair their systems. The US believes that North Korea and Russia were able to capitalize on those stolen hacking tools to unleash devastating global cyberattacks.

TBILISI: Popular dating apps like Grindr and OkCupid share personal data about users, including their location and sexuality, with about 100 other businesses, a Norwegian consumer group said on Tuesday, as it filed a complaint about breach of privacy rules.
The Norwegian Consumer Council found that 10 widely used Android apps that gather sensitive data about health, drug use, and sexual preferences passed some of it on to advertising and marketing firms without clearly informing users.

“These practices are out of control and in breach of European data protection legislation,” said Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy for the Norwegian Consumer Council.
“It is impossible for users to control this because the terms and conditions are really long and impossible to understand,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Tech companies have come under increased scrutiny over data privacy, fuelled by 2018’s Cambridge Analytica scandal in which tens of millions of Facebook profiles were harvested without their users’ consent.
The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), implemented in 2018, heavily restricts companies’ ability to process and share personal information without users’ consent, with hefty fines for firms that break the rules.
The Norwegian Consumer Council filed a complaint on Tuesday against the U.S.-based gay dating app Grindr and companies receiving data from it with Norway’s data authority, which said it was looking into whether they had broken GDPR rules.
Grindr said it rejected some of the report’s conclusions, adding that its privacy policy was shared with all users, who had individual control over what information they chose to provide in their profiles.
“As the data protection landscape continues to change, our commitment to user privacy remains steadfast,” the company said in a statement.
The council’s study found that the app, which is used by millions globally, shares data with a large number of third parties involved in advertising and profiling, many of which reserve the right to pass it on to others.
“Sharing location data for gay people can be risky in certain extreme circumstances,” Norway’s data protection commissioner Bjorn Erik Thon, said in a statement.
“There are still some who do not want to be open about their orientation, and there are many countries in the world where being gay carries great risks.”
The study also found that OkCupid shares information from users’ personal profiles related to sexuality, drug use and political views with an analytics company, while the dating app Tinder shares location and age with marketing firms.
The Match Group, which owns OkCupid and Tinder, said in a statement that it used third party providers to assist its services but only shared information deemed necessary to operate its platforms, in line with the applicable laws.
“Privacy is at the core of our business,” the company said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/china-launches-gigantic-telescope-in-hunt-for-life-beyond-earth/,"
SHANGHAI: China on Saturday officially opened operations of the world’s largest radio telescope, which it will use for space research and help in the hunt for extraterrestrial life, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST, is the size of 30 football fields and has been hewed out of a mountain in the southwestern province of Guizhou. It is also known by the name “Sky Eye” in China.
Xinhua reported that the telescope had received national approval to start operations. It finished construction in 2016 and has been undergoing debugging and tests in the years since.
FAST’s Chief Engineer Jiang Peng told Xinhua that the telescope’s trial operations had so far been reliable and stable, and that its sensitivity was more than 2.5 times that of the world’s second-largest telescope.
The project has also obtained some valuable scientific data over that time and is expected to help lead to some breakthroughs in areas such as low-frequency gravitational wave detection and interstellar molecules in the next three to five years, Xinhua said.
Advancing China’s space programme is a priority for Beijing, and the country has set a target to catch up with Russia and the United States and become a major space power by 2030.
Beijing plans to launch construction of its own manned space station next year.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/faeces-smeared-fakes-scientists-use-rubber-hands-in-ocd-therapy/,"LONDON: A new type of therapy using faeces and fake rubber hands may be able to help patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) overcome their fears of touching contaminated surfaces, according to new research.
“OCD can be an extremely debilitating condition for many people, but the treatments are not always straightforward,” said Baland Jalal, a Cambridge University neuroscientist who was part of a team assessing if rubber hands could be a potential new type of exposure therapy.

Traditional exposure therapy often involves instructing OCD patients to touch contaminated surfaces, such as a toilet seat, and then to not wash their hands. It aims to help patients control their fears in a safe, managed environment but many find it too difficult and cannot even begin therapy.
The Anglo-US trial involved patients having a fake hand and watching it being stroked until they developed a sensation that it was their own. The rubber hand was then smeared with faeces while their real hand was dabbed with damp tissue to mimic the feeling of faeces touching their skin.
The patients were asked to rate their disgust and anxiety levels, and the strength of the urge to wash their hands.
“Exposure therapy can be very stressful and so is not always effective or even feasible for many patients,” said Jalal.
“If you can provide an indirect treatment that’s reasonably realistic, where you contaminate a rubber hand instead of a real hand, this might provide a bridge that will allow more people to tolerate exposure therapy or even replace (it) altogether.”
Obsessive compulsive disorder is a psychiatric condition that affects as many as one in 50 people worldwide. It can have a serious impact on people’s lives, mental health, relationships and ability to hold down a job.
OCD comes in various types, one of which is characterised by severe contamination fears – even from touching everyday things like switches or door handles – leading to excessive washing.
Jalal said the results of the rubber hand study, which were published on Thursday in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, suggest fake hand contamination may help.
“The rubber hand illusion often makes people laugh at first, helping put them at ease,” he said. “It’s also straightforward and cheap compared to virtual reality, and so can easily reach patients in distress no matter where they are.”

Twitter Inc said on Wednesday it will test new features early this year that would allow users to control who can reply to their tweets, as it looks to limit abuse and harassment on the platform.
Social media firms are under pressure to address harassment on their sites, which often occurs in unsolicited replies targeting women and minorities, and Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey has promised since 2018 to increase the “health” of public conversation.
“We want to help people feel safe participating in the conversation on Twitter by giving them more control over the conversations they start,” the San Francisco-based company said in a tweet.
The company had launched a feature late last year allowing users to hide certain replies on their tweets as a part of its efforts to clean up abusive content and make the social media platform more user-friendly.
In a presentation at the annual CES tech conference, the company laid out plans, according to reports by several tech media, including The Verge and TechCrunch.
According to the presentation, users will be able to choose four different settings for replies: Global, which would allow anyone to respond, Group, which would allow replies from people a user followed or mentioned; Panel, or people mentioned in a tweet, and Statement, or no replies at all.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/tests-begin-on-bones-that-may-be-revolutionary-war-soldiers/,"NORTH HAVEN, CONNECTICUT: A university laboratory began tests Friday on skeletal remains found beneath an 18th century home in the hopes of identifying the three people believed to be soldiers killed during the Revolutionary War.
In December, while homeowners were renovating their house in Ridgefield, the remains were discovered in a grave under the foundation.
“These bones are so robust, they’re dense, they’re thick with muscle attachments (and) they’re long,” said Nick Bellantoni, emeritus state archaeologist of the Connecticut Museum of Natural History. “Who exactly they are, we are hoping the forensic work will show.”
The skull of one of the skeletal remains found buried in underneath a home that dates back to 1790, sits in a computerized tomography (CT) scan machine at Quinnipiac University’s Center for Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, on Friday, January 3, 2020, in North Haven, Connecticut. Photo: AP
While much remains unknown, researchers believe the remains belonged to men and possibly date to the Battle of Ridgefield, which occurred in April 1777. The way the men were buried in a haphazard grave also lends credibility to the idea that they were victims of the Battle of Ridgefield.
“They’re actually laying on top of each other overlapped,” Bellantoni said.
If confirmed, Bellantoni said that would make them the first remains from a Revolutionary War soldier recovered in Connecticut.
Bellantoni said the medical examiner quickly suspected the bones were very old because older bones tend to have less organic matter and start to flake over time.

Copper buttons found with the remains could indicate they belonged to militiamen.
While researchers suspect they might be soldiers, they don’t know if they might be British or American.
The bones are being analyzed at Quinnipiac University’s Center for Medicine, Nursing and Health Science in North Haven.
Jaime Ullinger, director of anthropology at the university, said they are starting to conduct X-ray analysis on the bones to help examine parts of the skeleton that have deteriorated over time.
She said that, even before the remains are identified, researchers will be able to gather other kinds of information, such as what kind of diet the men had and more broadly where they might be from.
Tania Grgurich, clinical associate professor of diagnostic imaging at the university, said it is an important opportunity to learn about history and for staff and students to be up close with unusual remains.
“This is part of our history, potentially, and then these are human beings that are being unearthed,” she said. “It’s not that often that something like this happens.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/digging-up-the-dirt-could-soil-contain-the-answer-to-food-shortages/,"
ROME: As water shortages, high temperatures and rising greenhouse gas emissions threaten food production, countries around the world are looking somewhere new for solutions – the soil.
For decades, farmers wanting to boost their yields have focused their attention on fertilisers, technology and new seed varieties.
Instead, they should be looking under their feet, according to experts, who warn that years of erosion and degradation of the soil through intensive farming have created the conditions for a global food production crisis.
“Data suggests that if we do not restore global soil health, it is highly likely the consequences within 10 years will be many, many millions facing food and water insecurity,” British soil expert John Crawford told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
This could lead to “civil unrest, mass migration, radicalisation and violence on an unprecedented scale,” said Crawford, until recently a science director at the world’s oldest agricultural research institute, Rothamsted Research.
Much of the problem is caused by erosion, which strips away the highly fertile top layer of soil. An area of soil the size of a soccer pitch is eroded every five seconds, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
While soil erosion occurs naturally, human activities such as intensive agriculture, deforestation and urban sprawl have significantly increased the rate at which it is happening.
Nearly a third of Earth’s soil is already degraded. At current rates, that will increase to 90% by 2050, the FAO forecasts, warning that pollution from human activity such as mining and manufacturing as well as erosion are to blame.
There are signs the world is beginning to wake up to the issue, which Crawford said it had only about 10 to 15 years to sort out.
Soil is “one of the most important regulators of global climate” because it stores more carbon than the planet’s atmosphere and vegetation combined, he said.
“If you fix soil, you mitigate a whole bunch of other risks,” added Crawford, now professor of technology and strategy at the Adam Smith Business School in Glasgow.
Whole Foods, the upscale US retailer that made its name selling organic food, has put “regenerative agriculture” – farming that focuses on soil health – at the top of its trends for 2020.
LOW-COST TESTING
From Iowa to the Ayeyarwady delta region of Myanmar – known as the country’s rice bowl – farmers are trying to figure out how to make their soil healthier and more productive.
In a remote village in the Ayeyarwady delta recently, a group of farmers sat cross-legged on a wooden floor and discussed why their once-thriving farms had become less productive.
The men had started testing their soil for the first time with the help of Proximity Designs, a business that designs low-cost farming products.
The company only began offering low-cost soil testing services in Myanmar in 2018 and by last October it had already sold more than 7,600 tests at $17 each, highlighting farmer interest.
“We didn’t have anyone to teach us (about soil). We followed suggestions from others, thinking they might work,” said Win Zaw, 44, who grows rice twice a year on his six-acre (2.4-hectare) farm.
“We knew something was wrong, but didn’t know what to do,” he said, looking down at neatly-typed sheets of paper detailing the levels of nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, acidity and organic matter in the soil.
All the farms were showing very low organic matter, which is produced by decomposing plants and is key to good soil health.
Proximity Designs’ agronomists said this was likely due partly to the warm climate, which degrades organic matter more quickly, and partly to local farming practices.
Their recommendations were relatively simple: leave crop residues after the harvest to retain the moisture in the soil, or sow cover crops – those planted to protect the soil between rice plantings rather than for commercial reasons.
When it came to fertiliser use, the recommended amount was much lower than what the farmers were using.
“Applying farming practices without knowing what’s happening in the soil can lead to crop failures, soil degradation, environmental damage and ecosystem breakdown,” said Proximity founder Debbie Aung Din.
‘ALLY OR ENEMY’
In Iowa, a state in the US Midwest known for its cornfields, farmers are increasingly seeking to improve soil health, said Richard Cruse, a professor at Iowa State University’s agronomy department.
“We see increasing numbers of cover crops that are being planted. We’re increasing the rate of no-till adoption,” he said, referring to a method of farming without tilling the soil that is said to reduce erosion.
“I’ve talked to several (farmers) in my area who are saying, ‘We have to do something different’.”
But many lack the expertise and skills, while farmers who rent say it is not worth investing in land that they do not own.
“In Iowa, more than half of the farmland is managed by farmers that don’t own the land,” said Cruse.
“I’ve had multiple farmers tell me, ‘conservation practices on land that I rent is a cost’.”
Ronald Vargas, land and water officer for the FAO and secretary of the Global Soils Partnership – a key player in pushing this issue – said farmers had to be given advice and incentives.
“Soil can be your ally or your enemy,” he said. “But in many countries, farmers are left alone. There is nobody advising them.”

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/century-old-tb-vaccine-may-work-better-if-given-in-a-new-way/,"WASHINGTON: Scientists think they’ve figured out how to make a century-old tuberculosis vaccine far more protective: Simply give the shot a different way.
In a study with monkeys, injecting the vaccine straight into the bloodstream dramatically improved its effectiveness over today’s skin-deep shot, researchers reported Wednesday.
“This offers hope,” although more safety studies are required before testing the approach in people, said Dr Robert Seder of the National Institutes of Health, a senior author of the study.
Tuberculosis kills about 1.7 million people a year, mostly in poor countries. The only vaccine, called the BCG vaccine, is used mainly in high-risk areas to protect babies from one form of the disease. But it’s far less effective at protecting teens and adults from the main threat, TB in the lungs.
Most vaccines are shots jabbed in the muscle or skin. Seder came up with the idea of IV immunization a few years ago, with experiments showing a malaria vaccine candidate worked better when injected into a vein. He wondered if the TB vaccine would react the same way.

Researchers at NIH teamed with the University of Pittsburgh to study certain monkeys, rhesus macaques, that react to TB infection much like people do. They tested a variety of ways to give the TB vaccine, including a mist that the monkeys inhaled through a mask.
Six months after the vaccinations, the researchers delivered TB bacteria straight into the animals’ lungs and watched for infection. Monkeys given today’s standard skin shot, even with a higher dose, were only slightly more protected than unvaccinated animals, and the mist wasn’t too effective, either.
But in 9 of 10 monkeys, a higher-than-usual vaccine dose injected into a vein worked much better, the researchers reported in the journal Nature. The team found no trace of infection in six of the animals and counted very low levels of TB bacteria in the lungs of three.
Why? The hypothesis is that key immune cells called T cells have to swarm the lungs to kill off TB bacteria and can do so more quickly when the vaccine is carried rapidly around the body via the bloodstream. Sure enough, tests showed more active T cells lingering in the lungs of monkeys vaccinated the new way.
The findings are striking, showing that how a vaccine is given “clearly affects immunity,” University of Massachusetts TB specialists Samuel Behar and Chris Sassetti, who weren’t involved in the study, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Still, giving a vaccine intravenously isn’t nearly as easy as other kinds of shots, they cautioned.
Seder said additional safety research is underway in animals, with hopes of beginning a first-step study in people in about 18 months.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/india-approves-third-moon-mission-months-after-landing-failure/,"BENGALURU: India has approved its third lunar mission months after its last one failed to successfully land on the moon, its space agency said on Wednesday, the latest effort in its ambitions to become a low-cost space power.
The Chandrayaan-3 mission will have a lander and a rover, but not an orbiter, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman K Sivan told reporters at its headquarters in Bengaluru, according to an official telecast.
The Chandrayaan-2 mission in September successfully deployed a lunar orbiter that relays scientific data back to earth, but was unable to place a rover on the lunar surface after a “hard” landing.
That mission had aimed to land on the south pole of the moon, where no other lunar mission had gone before. The region is believed to contain water as craters in the region are largely unaffected by the high temperatures of the sun.
ISRO had hoped to confirm the presence of water in the form of ice, first detected on its mission in 2008.
Chandrayaan-3 will have a “similar configuration” as the previous mission, Sivan said.
Only the United States, Russia and China have landed on the moon. Beijing’s Chang’e-4 probe touched down on the far side of the moon last year, while Israel made an unsuccessful attempt to land its Beresheet spacecraft on the moon in April 2019.
India’s third lunar mission will likely launch in 2020 and will cost less than its previous mission, the PTI news agency reported on Tuesday, citing Jitendra Singh, junior minister for the department of space.
Sivan also said ISRO was making “good progress” for its human space-flight mission slated for late 2021, adding that four astronauts had been picked for training, which will be planned later this month. The project, called Gaganyaan, would cost less than 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion), the government said in 2018.
India has developed a reputation for pioneering affordable satellite launches and space missions. Its unmanned Mars mission in 2014 cost just $74 million, less than the budget of the Hollywood space blockbuster “Gravity”.
Sivan also announced that ISRO had begun the land acquisition process for a second spaceport in the southern port city of Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu state.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/decade-in-review-what-the-smartphone-has-wrought/,"Dec 23: When the first Apple iPhone hit the market in 2007, not everyone was convinced it would supplant the flip-phone. When Google’s Android software system arrived a year later, the Blackberry still seemed to have bright future.
But with the iPhone 4 in 2010, featuring a high-resolution display, sleek design and front-facing camera, our collective fate was sealed. Here are 10 ways the smartphone has made its mark over the decade.
Access everywhere
Today some 5 billion smartphones are in use around the world, according to Canalys Research. The total number of internet subscriptions has soared to 7.2 billion globally from 1.3 billion in 2010, the vast majority of them mobile subscriptions, International Telecommunications Union data shows. The explosion in connectivity has been especially dramatic in the developing world, where there are now more mobile connections than people.
Tech uber alles
Apple Inc, once a niche computer company, is now one of the world’s most valuable companies thanks to the iPhone. The five largest Fortune 500 technology companies – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook – currently boast a market cap of $4.7 trillion, compared with about $800 billion for the top five in 2010. Not all of that is due to the smartphone, of course, but the mobile-related technologies and services accounted for nearly $4 trillion in economic activity in 2018, according to trade group GSMA.
There’s an app for that
Whether we’re hailing a cab, ordering food, playing a game, finding a date, listening to music or shopping for just about anything, there’s a good chance we’ll be doing it with a smartphone app that didn’t exist in 2010. Many of most popular apps are free, but consumers are still expected to spend more than $120 billion in app stores during 2019, according to App Annie, a mobile apps analytics firm.
Feed me
The endless scroll on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media apps now consumes 34 minutes of every U.S. adult’s day, according to Nielsen. Fewer people are sitting on the sofa to watch live TV at set times, and advertisers are following. Mobile ad spending surpassed TV for the first time in 2018 in terms of percentage share of the U.S. market, according to research firm eMarketer. We can also thank the smartphone for Instagram influencers, “sextortion,” and fake news.
Smile for the (smartphone) camera
Global shipments of digital cameras dropped from their 2010 peak of 121 million to just 19 million units in 2018, according to the Camera & Imaging Products Association (CIPA). Meantime the latest phones pack as many four camera lenses and cutting edge software that makes it easier than ever to get that perfect shot. The front-facing camera might be the busiest: Google reports that its Android devices take 93 million selfies every day.
Where am I?
The satellite tracking technology known as GPS, combined with information from cell towers and Wi-Fi networks, has made the smartphones incredibly powerful tracking devices. Google maps and its poorer cousins enable even the most directionally impaired find their way around unfamiliar locales with ease.
For the privacy-minded, though, it’s a disaster: Phone companies and app makers routinely record the movements of subscribers and sell that data to advertisers, a $20 billion-a-year business. The data is “anonymized,” but as numerous studies and a recent New York Times investigation have revealed it is often a simple matter to identify who is behind the dot on the map. Nearly 50% of companies surveyed by Verizon this year used or planned to soon use smartphone management tools to track their employees.
You can look it up
The 2010 edition of the venerable Encyclopedia Britannica, all 32 volumes and 129 pounds of it, turned out to be the last. But untold barroom arguments or dining room debates can now be settled on the spot: Wikipedia is consulted more than 240 million times daily.
Distracting ourselves to death
In 2018 alone in the United States, 2,628 fatal crashes involved a distracted driver, and of those deadly crashes, about 13% involved mobile phone use, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
Forget your wallet
Apple Pay and Google Pay are still afterthoughts for most U.S. consumers, but China may be a harbinger. Alipay and WeChat pay, China’s two big smartphone payment services, have reached a combined adoption rate of over 80% since they were launched around the beginning of the decade, according to a study by Bain. The QR code now peppers storefront windows. Even streetside beggars have adapted, sometimes rejecting cash and asking that payments be made via WeChat Pay or Alipay.
Say what?
Among the major casualties of the smartphone era is the conventional phone call itself: ubiquitous messaging apps have helped make video calls, GIFs, emojis and audio messaging preferred modes of communication. In the UK, for example, the total number of minutes spent on voice calls fell from 254 billion in 2013 to 206 billion in 2018, and the number of text messages dropped from 129 billion to 74 billion over the same period, according to Ofcom. Mobile data usage, meanwhile, jumped almost nine-fold between 2013 and 2018. The number of available emojis has nearly tripled to almost 3,000 since 2010.

A software problem on Friday caused the capsule to fail to attain the orbit needed to rendezvous with the space station, another unwelcome engineering black eye for Boeing in a year that has seen corporate crisis over the grounding of its 737 MAX jetliner following two fatal crashes of the aircraft.

Officials from the aerospace company and NASA breathed sighs of relief following the landing, a highly challenging feat.
“Today it couldn’t really have gone any better,” Boeing space chief executive Jim Chilton told reporters on Sunday, adding that experts would need weeks to analyze the data from this mission before determining if Boeing could move forward with its plan to send a crewed mission on the craft in 2020.
The landing, which tested the capsule’s difficult reentry into the atmosphere and parachute deployment, will yield the mission’s most valuable test data after it failed to meet one of its core objectives of docking to the space station.
“We’re going to get I think a lot more data than we would have gotten if the test had gone according to plan,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said.
After Starliner’s touchdown, teams of engineers in trucks raced to inspect the vehicle, whose six airbags cushioned its impact on the desert surface as planned, a live video feed showed.
The spacecraft was in good condition after landing, Chilton said, with little charring and stable air pressure and temperature in the cabin.
The CST-100 Starliner’s debut launch to orbit was a milestone test for Boeing. The company is vying with SpaceX, the privately held rocket company of billionaire high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, to revive NASA’s human spaceflight capabilities. SpaceX carried out a successful unmanned flight of its Crew Dragon capsule to the space station in March.
After the Starliner capsule was launched from Florida on Friday, an automated timer error prevented it from attaining the right orbit to meet and dock with the space station. Chilton said the timer was running 11 hours ahead, which caused the spacecraft to burn fuel too quickly.

PARACHUTE CHALLENGE
Starliner’s three main parachutes deployed just over one mile (1,600 metres) from the Earth’s surface on Sunday after enduring intense heat from the violent reentry through the atmosphere, plummeting at 25 times the speed of sound.
The parachute deployment, one of the most challenging procedures under the program to develop a commercial manned space capsule, earned Boeing a win after a previous mishap where one parachute failed to deploy during a November test of Starliner’s abort thrusters.
That test tossed the capsule miles into the sky to demonstrate its ability to land a crew safely back on the ground in the event of a launch failure.
For the current mission, Boeing and NASA officials said they still do not understand why software caused the craft to miss the orbit required.
Sunday’s landing marked the first time a US orbital space capsule designed for humans landed on land.
All past US capsules, including SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, splashed down in the ocean. Russia’s Soyuz capsules and China’s past crew capsules made land landings.
The now-retired Space Shuttle used to glide in like a massive plane.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/twitter-facebook-ban-fake-users-some-had-ai-created-photos/,"NEW YORK: Twitter has identified and removed nearly 6,000 accounts that it said were part of a coordinated effort by Saudi government agencies and individuals to advance the country’s geopolitical interests.
Separately, Facebook said it removed hundreds of Facebook accounts, groups and pages linked to inauthentic behaviour from two separate groups, one originating in the country of Georgia and one in  Vietnam, which targeted people both in Vietnam and in the US
Facebook said some of the accounts used profile photos generated by artificial intelligence and masqueraded as Americans. It is one of the first such misinformation efforts to use material generated by AI.
Tech companies have stepped up efforts to tackle misinformation on their services ahead of next year’s US presidential elections. The efforts followed revelations that Russians bankrolled thousands of fake political ads during the 2016 elections to sow dissent among Americans.
Twitter’s and Facebook’s announcements underscore the fact that misinformation concerns aren’t limited to the US and Russia.
In a blog post-Friday, Twitter said the removed Saudi accounts were amplifying messages favourable to Saudi authorities, mainly through “aggressive liking, retweeting and replying.” While the majority of the content was in Arabic, Twitter said the tweets also amplified discussions about sanctions in Iran and appearances by Saudi government officials in Western media.
“Governments have started to launch influence campaigns the same ways commercial enterprises launch campaigns to sell detergent or cars,” said James Ludes, a national defence expert who teaches international relations and public policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.
He said the Russian efforts in 2016 showed it was possible to “actually change public attitudes through the targeted use of social media.”
While the attempts to root out the campaigns may seem like a game of whack-a-mole, he said companies have at least shown progress in taking steps to identify and root out manipulation campaigns run by foreign powers.
Twitter began archiving tweets and media it deems to be associated with known state-backed information operations in 2018. It shut 200,000 Chinese accounts that targeted Hong Kong protests in August.
The 5,929 accounts removed and added to the archives are part of a larger group of 88,000 accounts engaged in “spammy behaviour” across a wide range of topics. But Twitter isn’t disclosing all of them because some might be legitimate accounts taken over through hacking.
The Twitter accounts were linked to a social media marketing firm in Saudi Arabia called Smaat that managed many government departments in Saudi Arabia. The accounts used third-party automated tools to amplify non-political content at high volumes. Twitter said that activity was used to mask the political manoeuvrings of the same accounts.
Samuel Woolley, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies disinformation, said that while the Saudi campaign used basic manipulation techniques, including the use of likes and retweets to give the illusion of popularity, the campaign’s size and scale were unusual. The existence of a thousands-strong army of Saudi accounts also show that social media companies still don’t have a good solution, he said, despite the progress, they have made at identifying state-backed accounts.
“It’s really clear we have to do something about it,” he said. “It can’t just be after the fact. We have to get better about detecting in real-time.”
Messages left with Saudi officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the country’s embassy in Washington was not immediately returned.
The Saudi government has used different tactics to control speech and keep reformers and others from organizing, including employing troll armies to harass and intimidate users online. It has also arrested and imprisoned Twitter users.
In September, Twitter suspended the account of the crown prince’s former top adviser, Saud al-Qahtani, who also served as director of the cybersecurity federation. As with Friday’s announcement, Twitter said that account had violated the company’s platform manipulation policy.
Last month, two former Twitter employees were charged with acting as agents of Saudi Arabia without registering with the US government. The complaint details a coordinated effort by Saudi government officials to recruit employees at the social media giant to look up the private data of Twitter accounts, including email addresses linked to the accounts and internet protocol addresses that can give up a user’s location.
In terms of Facebook’s actions, Facebook said the Georgia group targeted domestic audiences and the Vietnam group focused mainly in the US, as well as Vietnamese-, Spanish- and Chinese-speaking audiences around the world.
The company said they created networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing. To evade detection, they used a combination of fake and real accounts of people in the US to manage pages and groups, the company said.
“We are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we’ve said before, it’s an ongoing challenge,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security policy, said in a blog post.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-fined-150-million-euros-by-france/,"
PARIS: France’s competition authority fined Google 150 million euros ($167 million) for anti-competitive behaviour and for having unclear advertising on the Google Ads page.
The fine comes as France and other European countries maintain high levels of scrutiny on major US tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, which are often criticised for having relatively low tax payments.
In September, Google agreed to pay close to 1 billion euros to French authorities to settle a fiscal fraud probe that began four years ago.
Google, which is the world’s biggest internet search engine, has also faced growing regulatory scrutiny about the content it promotes in search results and ads.
Isabelle de Silva, head of the French competition authority, told news conference that Google’s dominance in the online advertising business was “extraordinary”, with the US company having a market share of around 90% in that field.
Google said it would appeal the fine.
In January, France’s data protection watchdog had fined Google 50 million euros for breaching European Union online privacy rules.
The French watchdog stated in that January ruling that Google lacked transparency and clarity in the way it informed users about its handling of personal data, and had failed to properly obtain their consent for personalised ads.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/scientists-narrow-age-estimate-for-fossils-of-human-ancestor/,"NEW YORK: Scientists say they have finally calculated the age of the youngest known remains of Homo erectus, which is generally considered an ancestor of our species.
The fossilised skull fragments and other bones were uncovered on the Indonesian island of Java in the 1930s. Determining their age has been a scientific challenge, and a wide range has been proposed by numerous studies.


In a report released Wednesday by the journal Nature, scientists conclude the remains are between 108,000 and 117,000 years old. Researchers used five dating techniques on sediments and fossil animal bones from the area, combining 52 age estimates for the analysis. The project took 13 years to complete.
“I don’t see any way to date this site more thoroughly,” said paleoanthropologist Russell Ciochon of the University of Iowa, an author of the study.
H. erectus arose in Africa about 2 million years ago and spread widely there and in Asia, and possibly into Europe. It reached Java more than 1.5 million years ago, and the new dates suggest it died out at least 35,000 years before the arrival there of our own species, Homo sapiens.
H. erectus may have been doomed on Java by climate change that turned its open woodland environment into rain forest, Ciochon said. Still, it evidently existed longer on Earth than any other species on our “Homo” branch of the evolutionary tree.
Susan Anton, a New York University anthropologist who did not participate in the work, called the dating effort “heroic.” But she said she considered the reported age range to be too narrow. She said she preferred a span of less than 550,000 years old to more than 100,000 years old.
That’s roughly what she and co-authors proposed in a paper published in 2011. The younger end of the range in that paper was as recent as 120,000 years, which she said is virtually the same as the new result.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/stone-age-chewing-gum-yields-human-dna/,"Paris, December 18 
Danish scientists have managed to extract a complete human DNA sample from a piece of birch pitch more than 5,000 years old, used as a kind of chewing gum, a study revealed yesterday.
The Stone-Age sample yielded enough information to determine the source’s sex, what she had last eaten and the germs in her mouth. It also told them she probably had dark hair, dark skin and blue eyes.

And genetically, she was more closely related to hunter-gatherers from the mainland Europe than to those living in central Scandinavia at the time, they concluded.
“It is the first time that an entire ancient human genome has been extracted from anything other than human bones,” Hannes Schroeder of the University of Copenhagen, told AFP.
Schroeder is co-author of the study, which was published in the review Nature Communications.
They found the sample during an archaeological dig at Syltholm, in southern Denmark, said Tehis Jensen, one of the other authors.
“Syltholm is completely unique,” he said.
“Almost everything is sealed in mud, which means that the preservation of organic remains is absolutely phenomenal.”
The researchers also recovered traces of plant and animal DNA — hazelnut and duck — confirming what archaeologists already know about the people who lived there at the time.
But they were not sure why their subject chose to chew the bark: whether to turn it into a kind of glue, to clean her teeth, to stave off hunger — or simply as chewing gum.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/in-new-york-lab-centuries-old-corals-hold-clues-to-climate-shifts/,"PALISADES, NEW YORK: Some 20 miles north of New York City, a team of scientists is searching for clues about how the environment is changing by studying organisms not usually found in the woods around here: corals.

In the labs of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a research unit of Columbia University overlooking the Hudson River, the scientists led by Professor Braddock Linsley pore over feet-long coral cores they extracted from far-away reefs.
For Linsley and his colleagues, corals are a precious repository of clues about the past that may help predict future climate trends. They can also reveal how much and how fast environmental conditions have changed during a certain period of time.
Cores are the hard, stony part of a coral underneath the top of the colony – its skeleton. Much like trees, corals produce growth rings that record climatic conditions like seawater temperatures and rainfall as they grow.
In a lab room packed with boxes of coral samples, Linsley and a small team of colleagues cut the cores into slabs and then X-ray the slabs to reveal the annual growth bands.
Using dentist drills, they pulverize small pieces and run geochemical analyses of the coral dust to reconstruct changes in the temperature, salinity and acidity of the water around the coral on a monthly basis going back hundreds of years.
“It is years of lab work and a lot of frustration but once you get to that point, the final product is just so exciting because you’ve got this long dataset,” Linsley said.
Coral reefs develop over thousands of years and are vital to the survival and prosperity of countless marine species. They also curtail flood damage from storms and support human activities like fisheries.
As humans burn more fossil fuel – the biggest contributor to global warming – oceans absorb growing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2).
Some of Linsley’s recent research on corals from the South Pacific island of Tonga suggests that increased seawater acidification caused by excess CO2 could lead to a decline in coral growth rates, endangering the wellbeing of entire reefs.

LOVE AT FIRST CHANCE
Linsley, a tall and soft-spoken 60-year-old, grew up on the Connecticut coast, making dams in the sand and observing erosion on the beaches near the town of Guilford. He loved water and began his career studying ocean sediments and fossils.
His work on corals began after a chance encounter with a colleague who was visiting his girlfriend at the University of New Mexico – where Linsley was studying to get his PhD in the late 1980s – led to a collaboration.
“I was fascinated by the fact that the corals had these annual bands in them and you could potentially extract annual resolve records back several hundred years,” he said at his office in the leafy campus, papers and books scattered on his desk and photos of diving expeditions on the wall.
Corals also brought him closer to the water and he had to learn how to dive, a perk of the job for Linsley.
By studying the environmental records derived from corals, the scientist is hoping to be able to shine a light on issues like the rate of surface ocean warming, ocean acidification and the impact on coral reef ecosystems worldwide.
But one thing is already evident, he said. Environmental changes are happening much more rapidly than in the last several thousand years and they are “clearly linked” to human activity.
Linsley’s childhood home in Connecticut – which he said now regularly battles encroaching waters – stood as a stark reminder.
“My children are 11 and 13. I think about in 50 years from now when I’m not here, what’s it going to be like,” he said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/remote-island-off-east-timor-turns-sunlight-air-into-drinking-water/,"KUALA LUMPUR: Villagers on a tiny island off the coast of East Timor who have long struggled with water shortages have secured regular fresh supplies, using just air and the power of the sun.
The innovative scheme uses solar power to suck water out of the air and make it drinkable, with the aim of reducing plastic waste and providing the small community on the wildlife-rich island of Atauro with a renewable supply of drinking water.
“The people living on Atauro have not had the opportunity to drink clean water that is not packaged in plastic,” said Rob Bartrop, chief revenue officer at Zero Mass Water the US technology firm behind the scheme.
“For the first time … they have a renewable source of water they can rely on,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Population growth and climate change are putting increasingly intense pressure on the planet’s limited water supplies, with worsening shortages emerging from the Middle East to Asia and Latin America, researchers said last month.
Like many similar islands in the region, Atauro lacks water infrastructure, leaving its 10,000 inhabitants reliant on rainwater and bottled supplies shipped in to meet their needs.
The new project, run with the US non-profit Conservation International, began operating in June and uses a material to absorb or suck water out of the air which is then turned into clean water.
In addition to reducing Atauro’s plastic water bottle waste, the project produces 12,000 litres of drinking water per month.
Zero Mass Water’s technology is now being used in schools, homes and businesses more than 35 countries, but the Atauro project is one of the first to be designed to serve an entire community’s drinking needs.
“We hope that there is a lot of scope to replicate and expand in surrounding parts of the region,” said Bartrop.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/holidays-bring-phishing-scam-surge-aimed-at-small-business/,"NEW YORK: The email looked legitimate, so Danielle Radin clicked on the link it contained, expecting to have her products included in a holiday gift guide.
“I instantly regretted it,” says Radin, owner of Mantra Magnets, a website that sells wellness products. “It took me to some random website that looked like those pop-ups telling you that you’ve won the lottery.”
Within days of that click three weeks ago, Radin began getting notifications that people in Ecuador, China and elsewhere were trying to access her email account. She wasn’t surprised; she knew her San Diego-based small business had been the target of a phishing scam.
While cybercriminals strike at any time of the year, they’re particularly active during the holiday and income tax filing seasons when computer users expect to see more emails — and scammers are increasingly targeting individual small businesses with phishing scams, sending messages that look legitimate but do harm instead. An unsuspecting owner or employee clicks on a link or attachment and like Radin finds that malicious software has invaded their PCs.
Cybersecurity experts find that criminals who used to blanket thousands of computer users in hopes of fooling a handful have refined their methods. Scammers find small businesses through websites, social media sites and by combing email address books. They also mine personal data from breaches at retailers and other large companies. Then, using a process called social engineering, they construct emails that increasingly look realistic, as if they truly come from a boss, colleague, friend, potential client or vendor, a bank and even the IRS.
“In the last year or two they’ve been running more professional campaigns,” says Perry Toone, owner of Thexyz, an email service provider based in Toronto. “It can take a couple of minutes for me to determine that they’re phishing scams. That tells me they’re doing a very good job.”
Radin believes the scammers found her through her website or a blog. Like many small businesses, she has an email address on her site, and the scammers figured out that she might be interested in selling via a holiday gift guide. But finding a target is one thing; the scam won’t work unless it tricks an email recipient into clicking. Even those who are tech savvy can sometimes let their guard down. Radin was duped even though she’s the author of “Everyone’s Been Hacked,” a book sold online.
Often a scam succeeds because there’s just a shred of doubt in a computer user — the email is realistic enough that an owner or employee feels they need to read it. Sometimes a staffer clicks out of fear or a sense of responsibility, says Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College.
“It might not sound very personal, but you have an idea that you should go ahead — you feel like the email is coming from the boss,” he says.
Computer users may not be looking as closely as they should at an email — there can be subtle signs that a message is trouble. Terry Cole, owner of Cole Informatics, a company whose work includes cybersecurity, recalls getting an email that truly seemed to be from a colleague. He was one of several people in the industry to receive it.
“It said that this colleague had sent me a secure private message that was ready for me to read and included a link to click. This was absolutely consistent with my normal experiences communicating with him,” says Cole, whose company is located in Parsons, Tennessee.
Cole didn’t do in that instance what he usually does and advises everyone to do: check the email address to be sure it’s completely correct. When he clicked on the link, it took him to a bogus website claiming to be connected with Microsoft and asking him for his ID and password. He went no further and suffered no damage to his PC.
The holidays provide scammers with extra opportunities: emailed greeting cards, package shipment notices, offers of discounts — all of them false. Cybercriminals also seek personal information from owners and employees under the guise of needing them to create a W-2 or 1099 tax form; at this time of year, business owners’ thoughts are turning to taxes.
“Something that claims to know you, your name, where you work and wants you to take some action is harder to spot,” says Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company based in Sunnyvale, California.
A common scam at holiday time is an email purportedly from the boss telling a staffer to go buy gift cards and email the numbers back, DeGrippo says.
“When it appears to come from a boss or CEO, I think there is that tendency among employees to follow those directions. They’re playing on their emotions,” she says.
Often, a scam succeeds in getting an employee to click on a personal email while on a company PC — many workers check their personal email while at work. Even though the email came through on a personal message, it’s the company’s machine that can be infected.
Companies can protect themselves in part by restricting employees’ access to personal email sites, Telang says. He also suggests seminars to help staffers understand the risks that even legitimate-looking emails can present.
Some of the scams aim at monitoring a user’s keystrokes. So anyone accessing a company or personal account of any sort can be giving a criminal access to their money or sensitive personal data. One tool to prevent a bank account from being emptied or a credit card maxed out is to have accounts with multifactor authentication; that requires a password and a separate code sent to a different device and that is different for each login.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-co-founders-step-aside-as-pichai-takes-helm-of-parent-alphabet/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google co–founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping aside as leaders of the Internet behemoth they founded 21 years ago, ending an extraordinary run that saw them build one of the world’s most valuable and influential companies.
Trusted lieutenant Sundar Pichai, who has run the core Google search business since 2015, will immediately take the reins as CEO of parent Alphabet Inc.
“While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it’s time to assume the role of proud parents — offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!” Page and Brin wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.
Page, Brin and Pichai have shared an emphasis on developing artificial intelligence software to make web searching faster and more personalised, while expanding the range of information and services available from a simple text query.
But their vision faces unprecedented scrutiny, with governments on five continents demanding better safeguards, an end to what many view as anticompetitive conduct, and more taxes from the world’s largest online advertising company. Thousands of employees have protested, and some have even resigned, over ongoing concern that Google‘s famous “don’t be evil” mantra – once embraced by Page and Brin – may be cracking.
Streamlining Alphabet‘s unorthodox management structure could help the company better respond to the challenges and focus on growing profits, investors said.
“This signals a shift away from the more fringy efforts … and more towards a company focused on technology that makes money,” said Kim Caughey Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
Alphabet, which owns more than a dozen companies including self-driving car business Waymo and health care software company Verily, was created in 2015 as part of a restructuring. The Google unit retained control of major businesses including video giant YouTube, the Android smartphone software and hardware operations, and cloud computing.
Page had wanted to focus on developing the newer businesses, which collectively lose money. He left Google, by far the biggest and most profitable part of Alphabet, to Pichai, who in turn delegates a lot of authority to deputies who manage the various product lines. Brin had stayed on as Alphabet‘s president, spending time on robotics, health ventures and other research projects.
But Page and Brin, once regular sights at public events and at Google headquarters, had become much less visible in recent years. Page’s retreat into the background drew increasing criticism from employees and US lawmakers, who demanded answers from him rather than Pichai about controversial projects such as an experimental search app for Chinese users.
Page and Brin, both 46, remain directors of the parent company but will cede their respective CEO and president titles immediately, Alphabet said. The president role will not be filled, it said, describing the changes as long discussed.
Page’s voice has been impaired for years because of a chronic condition, but his health did not play a role in the decision to step aside, Alphabet said.
“With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it’s the natural time to simplify our management structure,” the co–founders said. “We are deeply committed to Google and Alphabet for the long term.”
The co–founders still control the company through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26.1% of Alphabet‘s total voting power, Brin 25.25% and Pichai less than 1%. Alphabet shares rose 0.56% following the after-hours announcement to $1,302.
‘MOONSHOTS’ AND REGULATORS
Page and Brin developed the core Google search technology while they were still graduate students at Stanford, and it quickly proved far superior to competing search engines of the early Internet era.
By the time it went public in 2004, Google dominated Web search and was on its way to becoming a household name and the most powerful force in the global advertising business. The young co–founders also nurtured a free-wheeling, engineering-driven culture that became a model in Silicon Valley, which is littered with startups launched by Google veterans.
Pichai, 47, who has spent 15 years at Google, rose to prominence while leading the development of Google‘s Chrome browser. He later led product development and engineering across all of Google‘s services for a year before gaining the CEO title.
Page and Brin are active in a range of non-Google ventures. Page funded a company attempting to develop flying cars, and Brin at a conference last year discussed a budding interest in cryptocurrency. The Alphabet structure was designed in part to let them pursue new “moonshot” projects.
Investors and regulators, however, were never completely sold.
Alphabet had used the separation between Page’s and Pichai‘s roles to defend its limited financial disclosures about YouTube and other large Google businesses when the practice was questioned by US securities regulators in 2017.
It contended that publicly reported financial results were in line with what Page reviewed as Alphabet CEO. Regulators did not take further action, but the company’s stance has frustrated investors trying to evaluate its performance.
Alphabet declined to comment on whether public financial reporting would change with Pichai assuming both CEO positions.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/for-babies-born-with-hiv-start-treatment-right-away-study/,"WASHINGTON: When babies are born with HIV, starting treatment within hours to days is better than waiting even the few weeks to months that’s the norm in many countries, researchers reported Wednesday.
The findings, from a small but unique study in Botswana, could influence care in Africa and other regions hit hard by the virus. They also might offer a clue in scientists’ quest for a cure.
The Harvard-led team found super early treatment limits how HIV takes root in a newborn’s body, shrinking the “reservoir” of virus that hides out, ready to rebound if those youngsters ever stop their medications.
“We don’t think the current intervention is itself curative, but it sets the stage” for future attempts, said Dr Daniel Kuritzkes of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who co-authored the study.
Giving pregnant women a cocktail of anti-HIV drugs can prevent them from spreading the virus to their unborn children, a step that has dramatically reduced the number of babies born with the virus worldwide. Still, some 300 to 500 infants are estimated to be infected every day in sub-Saharan Africa.
Doctors have long known that treating babies in the first weeks to months of life is important, because their developing immune systems are especially vulnerable to HIV. But an infant dubbed the “Mississippi baby” raised a critical question: Should treatment start even earlier? The girl received a three-drug combination within 30 hours of her birth in July 2010, highly unusual for the time. Her family quit treatment when she was a toddler — yet her HIV remained in remission for a remarkable 27 months before she relapsed and restarted therapy.
The Botswana study was one of several funded by the US National Institutes of Health after doctors learned of the Mississippi baby, to further explore very early treatment.
The findings are encouraging, said Dr Deborah Persaud, a pediatric HIV specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the Botswana study but helped evaluate the Mississippi baby.
“The study showed what we hypothesized happened in the Mississippi baby, that very early treatment really prevents establishment of these long-lived reservoir cells that currently are the barrier to HIV eradication,” Persaud said.
She cautioned: “Very early treatment is important, but prevention should still be our top priority.”
In Botswana, researchers tested at-risk newborns, enrolling 40 born with HIV, treating them within hours to a few days, and tracking them for two years. On Wednesday, they reported results from the first 10 patients, comparing them with 10 infants getting regular care — treatment beginning when they were a few months old.
Medication brought HIV under control in both groups. But the children treated earliest had a much smaller reservoir of HIV in their blood, starting about six months into treatment, the researchers reported in Science Translational Medicine.
The earliest-treated children also got another benefit: more normal functioning of some key parts of the immune system.
One big question: Did the HIV reservoir shrink enough to make a long-term difference? To find out, next year the researchers will give these children experimental antibodies designed to help keep HIV in check, and test how they fare with a temporary stop to their anti-HIV drugs.
In the US, Europe and South Africa, it’s becoming common to test at-risk infants at birth. But in most lower-income countries, babies aren’t tested until they’re 4 to 6 weeks old, said study co-author Dr. Roger Shapiro, a Harvard infectious disease specialist.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/web-inventor-has-an-ambitious-plan-to-take-back-the-net/,"World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee released an ambitious rule book for online governance — a bill of rights and obligations for the internet — designed to counteract the growing prevalence of such anti-democratic poisons as misinformation, mass surveillance and censorship.
The product of a year’s work by the World Wide Web Foundation where Berners-Lee is a founding director, the “ Contract for the Web ” seeks commitments from governments and industry to make and keep knowledge freely available — a digital policy agenda true to the design vision of the 30-year-old web.
The contract is non-binding, however. And funders and partners in the endeavour include Google and Facebook, whose data-collecting business models and sensation-rewarding algorithms have been blamed for exacerbating online toxicity.
“We haven’t had a fairly complex, fairly complete plan of action for the web going forward,” Berners-Lee said in an interview. “This is the first time we’ve had a rule book in which responsibility is being shared.”
For instance, the contract proposes a framework for protecting online privacy and personal data with clearly defined national laws that give individuals greater control over the data collected about them. Independent, well-resourced regulators would offer the public effective means for redress. Current laws and institutions don’t measure up to that standard.
Amnesty International just released a report charging that Google and Facebook’s business models are predicated on the abuse of human rights.
Berners-Lee nevertheless says that “having them in the room is really important.” He said both companies had approached the foundation seeking participation.
“We feel that companies and governments deserve equal seats at the table and understanding where they’re coming from is equally valuable,” he said. “To have this conversation around a table without the tech companies, it just wouldn’t have the clout and we wouldn’t have ended up with the insights.”
The nonprofit foundation’s top donors include the Swedish, Canadian and US governments and the Ford and Omidyar foundations.
One of its biggest challenges is the growing balkanization of the internet, with national governments led by China, Russia and Iran exerting increasing technical control over their domestic networks, tightening censorship and surveillance.
“The trend for balkanization is really worrying and it’s extreme at the moment in Iran,” said Berners-Lee. A strong government exhibits tolerance, the computer scientist added, for “other voices, opposition voices, foreign voices to be heard by its citizens.”
So how to prevent governments from restricting internet access at their borders?
One approach, said Berners-Lee, could be financial pressure. Multinational lenders could condition lower interest rates, for example, on a nation’s willingness to let information flow freely on its domestic network.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-reins-in-political-advertising/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google is making it harder for political advertisers to target specific types of people.
The company said that as of January, advertisers will only be able to target US political ads based on broad categories such as gender, age and postal code. Currently, ads can be tailored for more specific groups — for instance, using information gleaned from public voter logs, such as political affiliation.
The change will take effect in the UK in the next week, before the general election, and in the European Union before the end of 2019. It will apply everywhere else in early January.
Google reiterated that ads making false claims are prohibited, adding that so-called deepfakes — realistic but false video clips — are not allowed. Neither are “demonstrably false” claims that could affect voter trust in an election.
But in a blog post announcing the news, Google Ads vice president Scott Spencer noted that political dialogue is important and “no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim and insinuation.”
“So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited — but we will continue to do so for clear violations,” he wrote.
Like all Google ads, political advertisers can also use the broader practice of “contextual targeting,” which involves placing ads about, say, climate change on articles about the environment.
The company is also requiring advertiser verification for a broader range of political messages. Previously, only ads mentioning candidates or officeholders for federal positions required verification. Now that will also include ads touching on state officials and candidates as well as ballot measures.
The move follows Twitter’s ban on political ads, which goes into effect on Friday.
Twitter also placed restrictions on ads related to social causes such as climate change or abortion.
In these instances, advertisers won’t be able to target those ads down to a user’s ZIP code or use political categories such as “conservative” or “liberal.” Rather, targeting must be kept broad, based on a user’s state or province, for instance.
Facebook has not made sweeping changes to any of its ads policies, but thrust the issue into public discussion this fall when it confirmed it would not remove false or misleading ads by politicians.
Critics have harshly condemned Facebook’s decision. Twitter also faced a backlash from those who found its ban too far-reaching.
Google has taken a more middling stance, but it’s unlikely to please everyone. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s campaign staff took issue with reports that Facebook might consider limiting its targeting practices.
“Facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020,” the campaign tweeted from its official account. “Tools that help us reach more great Americans & lift voices the media & big tech choose to ignore!”
Even Google’s limited targeting could receive backlash.
Critics and civil rights groups have said targeting specific zip codes or other small geographic zones can allow advertisers to discriminate or sway elections.
The expansion to Google’s verification process will take effect December 3.

Bangladesh lost all five test matches in 2019 and went into bat on a green-tinged surface, they got off to a terrible start at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.
The first 10 deliveries yielded only three runs and cost both their openers, including Saif Hassan who made a duck on his test debut.
Captain Mominul Haq (30) struggled against Pakistan’s short-ball barrage but he and Najmul Hossain (44) somewhat arrested the slide but were separated just when the partnership was blooming.
With the tourists reeling on 107-5, Mohammad Mithun (63) forged brief partnerships with Liton Das (33) and Taijul Islam (24) to take Bangladesh past the 200-mark which had looked improbable at one stage.
Pakistan captain Azhar Ali made good use of the review system, challenging original not-out decisions to get rid of opener Tamim Iqbal and top-scorer Mithun.
Mithun’s gutsy half-century included seven boundaries and a six and he left the field shaking his head after being adjudged caught behind to Naseem Shah.
Bangladesh managed to foil leg-spinner Yasir Shah but left-arm spinner Harris Sohail claimed two wickets.
The second test of the split series will be played in Karachi from April 5.

Santosh Tamang scored a brace as TAC defeated fellow departmental side Nepal APF Club 2-1 after Machhindra had moved to the top with a 6-1 thumping win against Saraswoti Youth Club. With their eighth victory, TAC accumulated 26 points from 11 matches, while Machhindra — who had earlier briefly climbed to the summit — are at the second position with 25 points.

With just two rounds remaining, Nepal APF Club are at the 13th position with five points, while Saraswoti are at the bottom with four. Unlike previous edition, the bottom-placed side will be relegated to B division. Yeti Himalayan Sherpa Club (seven) and Brigade Boys Club (eight) are also in danger zone.
In the departmental derby, Santosh Tamang opened the scoring in the 16th minute.
APF defender Ramesh Dangal brought down TAC skipper Bharat Khawas inside the penalty box and Tamang scored in rebound after goalkeeper Raju Yogi blocked his shot from the spot. APF levelled the scores in the 37th minute when Ashish Lama slotted past TAC goalkeeper Bikesh Kuthu after Ramesh Dangal set the ball for him with a header.
TAC restored the lead when Santosh Tamang found the top corner of the goal with a scorcher in the 41st minute and the striker also earned the Kelme man-of-the-match award for his heroics.
Earlier, TAC custodian Bikesh Kuthu made a brilliant save to stop Ashish Lama’s free kick in the 27th minute, while George Prince Karki struck against the post with a header following a cross from his skipper Bharat Khawas six minutes later. A minute later, Tanka Basnet’s long-range attempt was saved by APF goalie Raju Yogi, who also denied twin strikes from Tek Bahadur Budhathoki and Sudil Rai in the second half.
Earlier, man-of-the-match Dipak Rai scored a brace and Bishal Rai ‘A’, Devendra Tamang, Andres Nia Techounkue and Somide Oluwawunmi netted one each for Machhindra. Kazeem Adegoke Susari scored the consolation goal from the spot for Saraswoti.
Devendra Tamang opened the scoring in the 40th minute with a fine header following a corner from Ranjit Dhimal before going into the break. Dipak Rai doubled the tally in the 54th minute when he collected a pass from Dhimal and dodged Saraswoti goalkeeper Pradeep Bhandari before scoring in an empty nets. Dhimal was at the centre of the match as he provided Bishal Rai with a cross for the third goal in the 59th minute.
Fed by Yogesg Rai, Dipak Rai netted his second goal of the match to make it 4-0 in the 77th minute. Saraswoti pulled one back in the 86th minute from the spot after Machhindra defender Peter Segun handled the ball inside the danger zone.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/bcci-ends-hibernation-icc-braces-for-sleepless-nights-over-scheduling/,"
NEW DELHI: Sourav Ganguly has roused India’s mighty cricket board from a three-year slumber and its push for an exclusive new tournament to be included on the international calendar is set to give the game’s governing body and other stakeholders sleepless nights.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which has been revitalised under Ganguly’s leadership, says it generates 75% of the game’s total revenue and wants commensurate clout when it comes to deciding how it is run.
One demand is for a tournament involving the ‘Big Three’ of India, Australia and England plus another country to be slotted into an already bursting schedule, putting it on course for a clash with the International Cricket Council, which has enjoyed a period of calm in recent years at its Dubai headquarters.
India’s ‘Super Series’ proposal is a concern to many in the game, including the executive chairman of the Federation of International Cricketers’ Associations (FICA), Tony Irish.
“We want what is best for the global game,” the global players’ union chief told Reuters.
“Ultimately what is best for the global game will also be best for each individual country, even for the ‘Big Three’.
“FICA won’t be supporting proposals around scheduling, governance, or economic models which only benefit a few of the wealthier countries to the future detriment of the entire game.”
FICA is also concerned that the ICC is pressing ahead with plans for a new international tournament of its own in the 2023-31 cycle without consulting the players.
While some question why the ICC wants to add a new event to a calendar featuring a growing number of Twenty20 tournaments, the ICC is keen to introduce a new Champions Trophy-style tournament to improve its finances.
FORMIDABLE ADVERSARY
If it comes down to a battle of wills between Dubai and Mumbai over which new tournament gets the green light, the ICC is likely to find Ganguly a formidable adversary.
The BCCI’s last serious attempt to assert its clout with the ICC came with the ‘Big Three’ revenue model, which in 2014 effectively put India, England and Australia in control of the game’s finances and administration.
That model collapsed in 2017 and the board was subsequently run by a Supreme Court-appointed panel in an administration that ran until Ganguly was elected in October last year.
India’s feisty former captain has made it clear he will make sure the BCCI gets its fair share of the pie.
India coach Ravi Shastri summed up the BCCI’s position in a recent interview.
“Why should you be a tame little duck? You have to demand your pound of flesh,” Shastri told CNN-News18. “That’s the revenue you bring to the table. If I bring that to the table, what do I get in return?”
Ganguly and his colleagues have carried out behind-the-scenes talks with their English and Australian counterparts to garner support for the ‘Super Series’.
The England and Wales Cricket Board has said it is “open” to discussing the proposal while Cricket Australia (CA) Chief Executive Kevin Roberts found the idea “innovative”.
“There have been some formal and informal meetings, the content of which I am not in a position to share,” a CA spokesman said.
CANVASS SUPPORT
The ICC is not sitting idle and has sent out its top brass to canvass for its proposed tournament.
ICC Chief Executive Manu Sawhney and commercial general manager Campbell Jamieson met Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials in Dhaka last month.
“They have met Malaysia’s prime minister, visited Australia and New Zealand, and they are going to America as well,” BCB chief Nazmul Hassan told reporters in Dhaka.
“Those who are interested in hosting ICC events, they are visiting those countries and it will certainly raise the income of the member countries.”
Sports historian Boria Majumdar says Ganguly will eventually get his way, though he might be a little more subtle in his negotiations than Shastri’s comments suggest.
“The BCCI absolutely wants to assert itself in the ICC,” said Majumdar, co-author of the recently published “Dreams of a Billion” chronicling India’s Olympic campaigns.
“It naturally doesn’t want to lose 13-1 in ICC votes anymore, like it has happened in the last couple of years.
“But confrontation is not the way forward and no one knows that better that Sourav Ganguly.”

Real Madrid suffer first defeat since October
Sweden forward Isak scores twice for Sociedad
Marcelo, Rodrygo and Nacho on target for hosts

MADRID: Real Madrid were dumped out of the Copa del Rey at the quarter-final stage on Thursday after losing 4-3 at home to Real Sociedad in a hugely entertaining game which saw two goals ruled out by video technology and a late red card for the visitors.
Sociedad’s Sweden forward Alexander Isak inspired an incredible attacking display, scoring twice in the second period, setting up the fourth goal for Mikel Merino and also having a strike ruled out for offside.

Norwegian midfielder Martin Odegaard, who is on loan from Madrid, had given the visitors the lead midway through the first half, following up on the rebound after home keeper Alphonse Areola could only parry a long-range effort from Isak.
Defender Marcelo quickly pulled a goal back for the hosts after Isak’s quick-fire brace to make it 3-1, beating keeper Alex Remiro at the near post moments after receiving a volley of boos from the home fans for his haphazard display.
But rampant Sociedad soon restored a three-goal cushion when Isak teed up Merino for a simple tap-in after 69 minutes.
Madrid substitute Rodrygo pulled a goal back in the 81st to make it 4-2 after his Brazilian team mate Vinicius Jr had a strike ruled out for offside following a VAR review, while Nacho struck in added time for the hosts to set up a tense finish.
Sociedad defender Andoni Gorosabel was sent off in stoppage time but Madrid, who are top of La Liga, could not find an equaliser and suffered their first defeat in any competition since losing 1-0 at Real Mallorca on Oct. 19.
EUPHORIC MOOD
Sociedad coach Imanol Alguacil was in a euphoric mood after the victory, which recalled his side’s 4-0 win at the Bernabeu in a Cup semi-final in 1988.
“I said before the game that we were coming here to win and that’s what we did,” he told reporters.
“This result means so much to us, we put on a spectacle of football in front of a full Bernabeu crowd against a team of this quality. You can imagine how we feel.”
Madrid coach Zidane said his side were outplayed at times.
“Our opponents played very well and we struggled whenever they pressed us. We also made several defensive errors,” he said. “When you lose a match it means you have done something wrong, but we’re going to keep doing the same things as before.”
“Today we let in four goals at home and it’s difficult to come back from that,” added Marcelo.
“We tried very hard to pull it off but we reacted a little too late. Real Madrid is a very demanding club and when you don’t win it’s difficult, but we are still in two competitions, we have a very big squad with top players.”

Spanish striker Williams glanced a cross into the bottom corner to spark jubilant scenes at a rocking San Mames stadium and recalled Aritz Aduriz’s added-time goal in Athletic’s 1-0 home win over Barca on the first day of the Liga season.
They join Real Sociedad, Granada and second-tier Mirandes in Friday’s semi-final draw, which will not include Real Madrid, Barca or Atletico Madrid for the first time in 17 years.
The defeat heaped more misery on Barca in a tough week for the Catalans in which captain Lionel Messi spoke out against sporting director Eric Abidal and forward Ousmane Dembele was ruled out for the rest of the season with a hamstring injury.
Barca defender Gerard Pique said the team needed to show unity and refrain from in-fighting, adding that the performance, if not the result, proved that they had moved on from the saga.
“Now is not the time to air our dirty laundry, all I can say is we have 100% confidence in ourselves and we are pleased with how we played today and how we have reacted in the face of all this noise,” he said.
“It’s very tough to have been knocked out but we can take a lot of positive things from the game.”
Coach Quique Setien said he was hurt by the elimination but was pleased with the display.
“Today everything went well apart from the result,” he said. “We took a step forward in our play and I’m pleased with many things we did, I’m not only looking at the result.”
Messi spurned a glorious late opportunity for the visitors when he could only shoot at the legs of Athletic keeper Unai Simon and his fellow striker Antoine Griezmann also went close in the second half.
The game looked to be heading into extra time when Williams missed a gilt-edged chance but he made amends by getting the slightest of touches on a cross from Ibai Gomez in the third minute of stoppage time.
“I’m lost for words, you should never lose faith,” Williams told reporters. “The fans deserved this moment after the way they supported us and I now hope we can go on and fulfil the dream that we all have by going on to win it.”
The victory must have felt like redemption for Athletic, who were knocked out of the Cup by Barca in 2017 and 2016 and lost to them in the final in 2009, 2012 and 2015.
The Catalans have appeared in the last six finals but they joined Real Madrid in being knocked out after Zinedine Zidane’s side were beaten 4-3 at home by Real Sociedad earlier on Thursday.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/mourinho-praises-patched-up-spurs-after-cup-win/,"
LONDON: Tottenham Hotspur battled into the FA Cup fifth round with a barely deserved 3-2 win over Southampton on Wednesday as manager Jose Mourinho bemoaned his dwindling options due to the absence of key players.
Already missing long-term injury victims Moussa Sissoko and Harry Kane, plus new signing Steven Bergwijn who was ineligible, the Portuguese had to field France midfielder Tanguy Ndombele who is not yet ready for 90 minutes after a few minor niggles.
Dele Alli was only fit enough for a place on the bench after a late tackle on Sunday by his England team mate Raheem Sterling in Tottenham’s 2-0 Premier League win over Manchester City left him nursing a sore ankle, although he did come on after an hour.
But if Mourinho’s teams have anything it is the ability to dig out a result against the run of play and his new Spurs side are showing admirable levels of resolve to grind out victories.
After he admitted the best team had lost a thrilling Cup tie at the Tottenham Stadium, Mourinho praised his players for their determination to get themselves out of a hole against a counter-attacking Southampton side who were always dangerous.
Spurs, having led through a Jack Stephens own goal, found themselves behind after strikes by Shane Long and Danny Ings but Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min with a penalty snatched the win.
“We were really in trouble. Lots of fatigue after the match against City. They were better than us, stronger physically, faster than us. They pressed, they had intensity, they had chances. They were the best team,” Mourinho told reporters.
“My players were phenomenal. The way they reacted was fantastic. Incredible soul, incredible heart, great connection with the crowd and they gave absolutely everything. So I think the best team lost but we deserved to win.”
Mourinho, who said the club’s lengthening injury list was making it a difficult season, will grant his players an extra day off after their efforts, although there is no time for the sort of winter break being enjoyed by rival teams.
Midfielder Giovani Lo Celso was missing with a thigh problem and forward Erik Lamela with a groin issue, adding to Mourinho’s selection headache but his side rode their luck to reach the fifth round where they have a home tie against Norwich City.

Lewandowski stretched Bayern’s lead further in the 36th minute and looked to have wrapped the game up when he struck again with 10 minutes remaining, netting for the 35th time in all competitions this season.
Yet Hoffenheim’s new forward Moanes Dabour pulled a goal back for the visitors two minutes later and scored again in added time to set up a tense final few minutes.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/son-sends-tottenham-through-to-fa-cup-fifth-round/,"
LONDON: Tottenham Hotspur rode their luck to reach the FA Cup fifth round as Son Heung-min’s late penalty sealed a 3-2 victory in a rip-roaring replay against Southampton on Wednesday.
As in the 2-0 Premier League win against Manchester City at the weekend Jose Mourinho’s side were often outplayed but showed character to set up a home tie with Norwich City.

South Korean Son has often been the go-to player when lead striker Harry Kane is injured and again he stepped up to convert in the 87th minute after being taken down by keeper Angus Gunn in a frenetic finale.
Son’s conversion was his 11th goal in the FA Cup since the start of the 2016-17 season — more than any other player.
It was tough on Southampton who deserved more, according to Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho.
“I have to be honest and say I think the best team lost on the pitch but my team were the ones with more heart and went to their limit,” said the Portuguese, whose one FA Cup triumph came with Chelsea in 2007.
“So many difficulties to even build a team, the options were not options to change the game. My team to deserved to win — but the best team lost.”
Southampton played nearly all the football after unluckily falling behind in the 12th minute when Jack Stephens attempted to block Tanguy N’dombele’s off-target shot but only deflected it past a helpless Gunn.
Ralph Hasenhuettl’s side responded in dynamic fashion with Danny Ings smashing a shot against the bar after 18 minutes.
They did level after 34 minutes when Shane Long netted from close range after Hugo Lloris parried the ball into his path after a smart turn and low shot by Nathan Redmond.
Southampton’a James Ward-Prowse was carried off five minutes before halftime with a knee injury but they dominated possession after the break as Tottenham were reduced to playing on the counter-attack.
One of those should have seen Spurs reclaim the lead when Son crossed for Lucas Moura but he headed wide.
With both sides throwing caution to the wind in search of victory it was Southampton who appeared to be heading through when a superb forward foray by Redmond ended with Ings cutting in and slotting a clinical right-foot shot past Hugo Lloris.
Roared on by the home crowd Tottenham drew level when Moura danced through the Southampton defence and fired a low shot into the corner.
With extra time beckoning Dele Alli played in Son who dummied Gunn but tumbled under minimal contact.
A short VAR check confirmed the penalty and Son coolly dispatched the spot-kick.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/new-zealand-beats-india-by-4-wickets-in-high-scoring-odi/,"HAMILTON, NEW ZEALAND: Ross Taylor scored an unbeaten 109 runs as New Zealand overhauled India’s 347-4 to win the first one-day cricket international Wednesday by four wickets with 11 balls to spare.
Taylor’s 21st ODI century and his 138-run partnership with Tom Latham (69) helped New Zealand get past India’s formidable total, breaking its nine-match losing streak across all formats.
New Zealand finally found a winning formula in its favorite format, mounting a well-paced chase for its second highest winning total on home soil.
Henry Nicholls made 78 at the top of the order, putting on 62 with Taylor. But it was the 117 runs Taylor and Latham added between the 30th and 40th overs that swung the match in New Zealand’s favor.
When Latham was out in the 42nd over, New Zealand was 309-4, needing 39 runs from 50 balls. New Zealand, which lost three of five T20 internationals against India from commanding positions, lost Jimmy Neesham and Colin de Grandhomme in quick succession.
Taylor guided New Zealand home with Mitchell, who was 12 not out at the end.
“I think it’s been an interesting summer and it was good to get across the line,” Taylor said. “Different format, different series and I think there were a lot of contributions throughout the top order and even with the ball.
“To restrict them to under 350 gave us a chance.”
Earlier, Shreyas Iyer’s maiden century drew attention away from the debut of Prithvi Shaw as India set New Zealand an imposing total.
Iyer made 103 and shared partnerships of 102 for the third wicket with captain Virat Kohli (51) and 136 for the fourth wicket with K.L. Rahul, who made an unbeaten 88.
The announcement Tuesday that the 20-year-old Shaw would make his one-day international debut as a replacement for the injured Rohit Sharma generated a considerable buzz around the match at Seddon Park.
Injuries to Sharma and Shikhar Darwan gave Shaw an unexpected opportunity to return to the India team for his ODI debut; he formed a new opening partnership with Mayank Agarwal, who was also playing his first ODI.
The pair gave India’s innings a solid footing when they put on 50 in eight overs. The ball seamed early and swung in a strong crosswind and Shaw looked technically sound in making 20 from 21 balls.
Captain Virat Kohli reached a half century from 61 balls before being bowled by leg spinner Ish Sodhi and Iyer went on to his half century from 66 balls. He made the best of a reprieve on 83 when he was dropped by de Grandhomme from the bowling of Mitchell Santner and reached his century 35 balls later.
Rahul stepped up the run-rate as he dashed four sixes in his half century from 44 balls and Kedar Jardhav boosted the India total with 26 off 15 balls.

TOKYO: The spread of a new coronavirus could throw “cold water over the growing momentum of the 2020 Games,” Tokyo Organising Committee CEO Toshiro Muto said on Wednesday.
“I am seriously concerned … I hope this will be resolved as soon as possible,” Muto said at a meeting in Tokyo with the organisers of the Paralympic Games.
Japanese government officials including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have said the government would work hard to minimise any impact from the virus outbreak on the Games, which start on July 24.
The death toll from the flu-like virus that originated in China’s central city of Wuhan has passed 490, as two U.S. airlines suspended flights to Hong Kong following the first fatality there and 10 cases were confirmed on a quarantined Japanese cruise ship.
Vaccines against the virus probably won’t be ready by the start of the Tokyo Summer Olympics, a professor who looked at health risks ahead of the Games told Reuters earlier, adding he hoped there was enough time to build defences.
Saburo Kawabuchi, head of the athletes’ village for the 2020 Olympics, said he hoped the games would proceed smoothly, free from the virus.
Several qualifying events including badminton and boxing have been postponed due to the virus.

Liverpool set up fifth-round tie with Chelsea
Rooney’s Derby to face Man Utd
Newcastle edge past Oxford

LONDON: Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp, it seems, can do no wrong after his youngsters vindicated his decision to rest his entire first-team squad by beating third-tier Shrewsbury Town 1-0 in their FA Cup fourth-round replay at Anfield on Tuesday.
Klopp, whose side are 22 points clear and heading for a first English league title for 30 years, was not even in attendance but would have been smiling as Ro-Shaun Williams’s unfortunate 75th-minute own goal sealed victory and a fifth-round clash with Chelsea.

Seven-times winners Liverpool, whose starting lineup was the youngest in the club’s history, were given a let-off as League One Shrewsbury, backed by 8,000 fans, had a goal ruled out via VAR with the score 0-0.
But they were worthy winners and the youngsters received a standing ovation as they steered Liverpool into the fifth round for the first time since Klopp took over in 2015.
“It was just unbelievable,” 18-year-old Neco Williams said. “It was a night that we will remember for a long time.
“Hopefully we will do the same against Chelsea in the next round. Every team Liverpool put out will put everything out there on the pitch.”
Wayne Rooney will face his old club Manchester United in the fifth round after he netted a penalty for Derby County in their 4-2 win over fourth-tier Northampton Town.
Newcastle United edged past third-tier Oxford United 3-2 thanks to a superb extra-time winner by Allan Saint-Maximin.
Steve Bruce’s side, held at home, had been cruising with goals by Sean Longstaff and Joelinton.
But Oxford hit back through Liam Kelly and Nathan Holland’s sublime volley in the fourth minute of stoppage time sent the tie into 30 minutes of extra time.
Newcastle have reached the fifth round for the first time since 2006 and will face Championship side West Bromwich Albion.
The night’s other replays were decided by penalties with Reading beating Cardiff after a 3-3 draw. Birmingham City edged out Coventry City after it finished 2-2 after extra time.
Reading host Sheffield United while Birmingham, who needed a stoppage time Harlee Dean equaliser, travel to Leicester City.
After his side squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Shrewsbury, Klopp had vowed that no first-team players would feature in the replay as it fell during the inaugural Premier League winter break.
As against Aston Villa in a League Cup quarter-final in December, when the first-team squad were at the FIFA Club World Cup, he gave under-23 manager Neil Critchley the reins.
On that occasion Liverpool’s ‘kids’ suffered a 5-0 loss, but they proved too technical for Shrewsbury.
Critchley’s side, with an average age of 19 and only Curtis Jones and 16-year-old Harvey Elliott having any Premier League experience, gave Shrewsbury a lesson in passing and movement in the first half without much of a goal threat.
Shrewsbury, who have twice reached the last eight and knocked out Everton in 2002-03, improved after the break and their fans were in raptures when Shaun Whalley headed in from close range, only for their cheers to be silenced when a VAR check ruled the effort out for offside.
Liverpool, unbeaten in 40 games at Anfield in all competitions, are next in action away at Norwich City on Feb. 15 when Klopp’s seniors return to continue their title procession.
Judging by Tuesday’s display, the future looks as bright as the present at Anfield.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/making-the-climb-to-the-summit-of-majestic-mt-fuji/,"SHIZUOKA, JAPAN: People come from all over Japan to climb to the summit of Mount Fuji to see the sunrise.
Buses from Tokyo’s Shinjuku district conveniently drop climbers off at a station located at the 2,300-metre (7,546 feet) point of the majestic mountain, the country’s tallest at 3,776 metres (12,388 feet). It’s not cheating. This is where most people start the long — and crowded — trek.





The Yoshida trail is the easiest and most popular among the routes to the top, with climbers wearing headlamps and carrying heavy packs spaced just feet apart on the rugged, rocky terrain. It takes an average hiker five to six hours to reach the summit. Most spend the night in simple mountain huts and start the final ascent in darkness. Crammed together in the sparse accommodations is part of the communal climbing experience.
Witnessing the sunrise from the summit of the nation’s symbolic mountain is hard to top. Watching it paint the sky deep orange is magnificent.
Climbing season runs from early July to early September, Mount Fuji will open to the public a couple of weeks before the Tokyo Summer Olympics opening ceremony on July 24.
After the descent, visit picturesque Lake Kawaguchi to photograph Mount Fuji from afar.

BANGKOK: Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, edged out Paris and London as the world’s most popular city to visit, according to a survey released on Wednesday, welcome news for Thailand after worries over a drop in foreign arrivals.
Bangkok was named the most-visited city for the fourth consecutive year, with about 22.8 million visitors reported in the annual rankings by MasterCard Inc.
Paris and London were ranked second and third, each with about 19.1 million arrivals, trailed by Dubai with 15.9 million.
Other Southeast Asian cities, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were fourth and fifth in the rankings, based on third-party research, proprietary analysis and public data across 200 destination cities.
New York, Istanbul, Tokyo and Antalya, Turkey, rounded out the top 10.
The number of international visitors across the 200 cities grew by 76% in the last 10 years.
Despite Bangkok’s longtime reign atop the list, the Thai tourism industry has faced headwinds, with arrivals dropping 1.03% year-on-year in May before recovering to grow 0.89% in June from a year earlier.
Tourism accounts for about 12% of Thailand’s economy.
However, weaker Chinese economic growth and a boat accident last year led to a drop off in Chinese arrivals in Thailand in the first half of this year.
The downturn in the number of visitors from China was partially offset by Indian arrivals.
Thailand expects to welcome 2 million Indian tourists in 2019, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, told Reuters, adding this was one year earlier than its target.
In August, the government extended a waiver of a 2,000 baht ($65) fee for visa-on-arrivals for tourists from 18 countries including those from China and India.
A growing middle class and increasing wealth in populations and the rise of low-cost airlines will make travel more accessible, Minor Hotels Chief Executive, Dilip Rajakrier, said in an email.
“Given only less than 10% of the China’s total population having passports today. The potential of the Chinese market will never fade,” he said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/thailand-extends-visa-fee-waivers-to-boost-tourism-as-growth-slows/,"BANGKOK: Thailand will extend until April next year a measure that waives fees for visas on arrival issued to tourists from 18 countries, as it looks to stimulate growth in tourism to spur a slowing economy, the prime minister said on Tuesday.
The waivers are part of a $10-billion stimulus package to boost growth, including a debt moratorium for farmers, loans for smaller businesses, and more money for low-income earners.
“The cabinet approved the extension of fee waivers until April 2020,” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters, adding that the scheme would cover Lunar New Year and the Thai new year, Songkran.
Foreign tourist receipts make up about 12% of Southeast Asia’s second largest economy, but arrivals increased just 0.89% in June, with visitors from China, the biggest source, declining 7.1% from a year earlier.
The fee of 2,000 baht ($65) is to be waived unil next year for travellers from 18 countries, including China and India.
But the cabinet rejected a proposal for visa-free entry for visitors from China and India, because of security concerns, government spokesman Narumon Pinyosinwat said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/not-just-bali-indonesia-hopes-to-develop-more-tourism-sites/,"YOGYAKARTA: Hundreds of tourists, many of them young Westerners, sat on grey stone steps atop the world’s largest Buddhist temple, occasionally checking cellphones or whispering to each other as they waited for daylight.
Sunrise wasn’t spectacular on that recent summer day. But even ordinary dawn at Borobudur Temple — nine stone tiers stacked like a wedding cake and adorned with hundreds of Buddha statues and relief panels — provided a memorable experience.

The 9th-century temple is in the centre of Indonesia’s Java island, a densely populated region with stunning vistas. Other highlights include the towering Hindu temple complex of Prambanan, like Borobudur a UNESCO World Heritage site, and Mount Merapi, the country’s most active volcano, whose lava-covered slopes are accessible by jeep.
While the two temples draw many visitors, other foreigners head to the relaxing beaches of Bali, just east of Java and by far the most popular tourist destination in a nation of thousands of islands and almost 270 million people. More than 6 million tourists visited Bali last year, or about 40 per cent of 15.8 million visitors to Indonesia overall, according to official figures.
Recently reelected President Joko Widodo wants to change this dynamic by pushing ahead with “10 new Balis,” an ambitious plan to boost tourism and diversify Southeast Asia’s largest economy.
Key to the plan is to upgrade provincial airports and improve access to outlying destinations, such as Lake Toba on Sumatra island, more than 1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from Jakarta, the capital. Yogyakarta, the provincial city from where visitors head to Borobudur and Prambanan, is getting a second airport, expected to be fully operational later this year.
Widodo has been promoting his plan in meetings with foreign leaders and in recent interviews, including with The Associated Press, in hopes of encouraging foreign investment. The president of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation told the AP in late July that as part of his push, he would like to see more business ties with the Middle East.
“For investment and tourism, we would like to invite investors from the Middle East as much as possible because … we have many tourism locations in Indonesia, not only one or two or four, but many,” said Widodo. He did not give specifics.
Muslim tourists, including from the Middle East, might also be an easier fit for some of the more conservative areas earmarked for tourism development. Tourism officials have played down the possibility of cultural friction that might accompany the influx of more non-Muslim visitors, arguing that Indonesia’s brand of tolerant Islam can accommodate everyone.
“Maybe there are some particular locations that are very strict (religiously),” said Hiramsyah Thaib, who heads the “10 New Balis” initiative. “We believe we won’t have any problems. Sometimes we have problems in the media, but not in reality.”
Yet Islamic hard-liners have become more assertive in recent years, potentially spooking investors by undermining Indonesia’s image as a moderate nation. Thaib said he believes investor confidence rose “significantly” after Widodo defeated former special forces general Prabowo Subianto in April’s presidential election. Subianto had been backed by Muslim groups favouring Shariah law.
The tourism plan remains key to Widodo’s final five-year term, though at least one target — 20 million visitors this year — appears to have been too ambitious. The 2019 visitor tally is expected to be 18 million, based on current growth figures, said Thaib.
Still, the Indonesian tourism sector grew by 7.8 per cent in 2018, or twice the global average, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
One of the 10 sites earmarked for development is the Borobudur Temple area and nearby Yogyakarta, a city of several hundred thousand people that are embedded in a large metro area. The city is a centre of Javanese culture and a seat of royal dynasties going back centuries.
In 2017, former President Barack Obama and his family visited the city, where his late mother, Ann Dunham, spent years doing anthropological research. Obama, who lived in Indonesia as a child, toured Borobudur and Prambanan during the nostalgic trip.
But while the Obamas got around with relative ease, including private jet travel, ordinary visitors struggle with congested streets packed with motorbikes weaving in and out of slow-moving traffic.
Travellers hoping to be in place at Borobudur just before sunrise need at least 90 minutes to get there from Yogyakarta, a journey of 40 kilometres (24 miles). A 230-kilometre (140-mile) round trip to the Dieng highlands, with terraced fields, small temples and a colourful volcanic lake, requires a full day of travel, some of it on bumpy back roads.
Anton McLaughlin, a 55-year-old visitor from York, England, said he was astounded by the number of motorbikes in the streets. Speaking during a jeep tour of the slopes of Mount Merapi, he said he’s become more aware of the natural disasters Indonesians endure regularly. Indonesia straddles the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Merapi’s last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people, and the ruins of one destroyed hamlet were part of the tour.
“People just seem to crack on with life,” McLaughlin said.
Just a day after his tour, the volcano shot out hot clouds and lava that flowed 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) down its slopes. No casualties or damage were reported.
Jan Tenbrinke, 37, from Zwolle in the Netherlands, said Bali is the next stop for his family of four, but that he hoped to get a better sense of Indonesian culture in Yogyakarta.
In the city, tourists can visit workshops for Batik textiles, silver jewellery and Kopi Luwak — coffee made from partially digested coffee cherries that were eaten and defecated by wild tree cats, or civets. Billed as the “world’s most expensive coffee,” Kopi Luwak became known to a wider audience in the 2007 Jack Nicholson-Morgan Freeman movie “The Bucket List.”
Local museums, including two royal palaces and a former Dutch fort, pose a challenge for foreign visitors eager to learn more about local history and culture because they mostly lack easily accessible explanations in English.
Thaib, the tourism official, acknowledged that there is room for improvement. He said Indonesia is determined to catch up to other Asian nations, including Thailand, which he said began developing their tourism industries much sooner.
“There is still a lot of work,” he said of his nation’s efforts. “We believe we are on the right track.”

HIKKADUWA: Sipping fresh coconut water while sunbathing on deserted Hikkaduwa beach, Alexi Konchayenko, a sports trainer from Ukraine, struck a stoical note.
Bomb blasts can happen “anywhere, anytime,” he said, adding that he was not afraid. “Sri Lanka is an amazing country. This is my first visit and I will tell my friends also to come.”
His is a lone voice — and a lone presence. Sri Lanka was the Lonely Planet guide’s top travel destination for 2019, but since the Easter Sunday attacks on churches and luxury hotels, foreign tourists have fled.
Many of those booked to come in the next few months have cancelled. Hotel occupancy across the island has plummeted by 85% to 90%. The tropical beaches, restaurants and shops are empty.
The coordinated suicide bombings on April 21 not only destroyed lives but also wiped out the livelihoods of Sri Lankans who depend on tourism.
More than 250 people, including 45 foreigners mainly from China, India, the US and the UK, died in the Islamic State group-claimed blasts.
Tourists normally come to Hikkaduwa, in the southwest, for the strong waves that are perfect for surfing and sparkling clear waters made for snorkelling. Today, of the 27 hotels, very few are open. Most, along with the eateries that line the 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of palm-fringed beach, are closed.
Among the few hotels still open is Hikkaduwa Beach Hotel. On April 21, all 50 rooms were occupied; today, only a handful. “It’s a real disaster. We don’t know what to do right now,” said Sanjeewani Yogarajah, an executive with the hotel. She said the attack has cost the hotel 5.5 million Sri Lankan rupees ($31,000), forcing the hotel’s management to send half the staff home.
Some tourism officials say the damage to the industry after the bombings is worse than during the 26-year civil war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the government which ended a decade ago. At least then, the violence was mostly contained to the north of Sri Lanka, they said. This time, no part of the island has remained untouched by the blasts.
Lankesha Ponnamperuma, general manager of hotel chain Hikka Tranz, is one of the luckier ones. While most hotels report wholesale cancellations, he is surviving thanks to business from local residents. Last Friday, two-thirds of the 150 rooms were booked, mostly by domestic tourists.
“I haven’t sacked anyone yet. Instead, we are training our people to adjust their expenditure and helping them restructure their bank loans,” Ponnamperuma said.
The president of Sri Lanka’s Hotels Association, Sanath Ukwatta, said hotels have offered 30-50% discounts to entice local residents.
Such a strategy won’t solve the problem, he said, but will “help at least to keep the hotels going.”
The manager of a clothing shop said the owner had shut the group’s other two shops and the factory too. “Business collapsed after April 21,” said Kumari, who declined to give her surname.
According to government figures, there has been an 80% drop in arrivals since the attack. Tourism accounts for 4.9% of Sri Lanka’s GDP. Last year, 2.3 million tourists visited the island, generating $4.4 billion in revenues, a nearly 12% jump from 2017. Around half a million Sri Lankans directly depend on tourism while 2 million depend on it indirectly.
One of them is Mohomed Musflick, the owner of a souvenir shop in Galle which is full of wood carvings, local paintings and postcards. “I have not sold one item. There are no tourists and we are in a huge crisis,” he said.
While life is gradually returning to normal on the island with offices and schools re-opening, the tourism industry is in a sombre mood over the slump in foreign tourists. Tour operators from Russia, Norway and Britain have cancelled bookings going right up to April 2020.
A travel ban issued by nearly a dozen countries is the greatest cause for concern. “The ban is our main worry. Until it is removed or softened, we can’t start our marketing to attract tourists. If it is lifted soon, we are hopeful we can bounce back this year or otherwise definitely next year for sure,” said Yogarajah.
In the meantime, Sri Lanka’s government should target “people and countries resilient to this kind of attacks and situations, such as Russia, Israel and India,” said Anusha Frydman, managing director of the Lavanga Resort and Spa.
The industry is clear about what else it wants from the authorities: Ensure that stringent security measures are in place to reassure potential visitors; persuade politicians to put their differences aside and adopt a bipartisan approach on national security; and work fast to get the travel ban lifted.
To help the industry cope, the government has put together a relief package comprising easy loans at special rates and reduced taxes. The government also plans to formulate a $100 million insurance fund for compensation to any tourist injured or killed while visiting the island.
“In the past we have had many serious crises and we have recovered. I am quite positive we can do it again,” said Jan van Twest, general manager of the Fortress Resort and Spa near Galle, where 750 room nights have been cancelled from May to October.
“But we need to recover, recover very fast,” he said.

Whenever I told someone I was planning to climb to Mount Everest Base Camp this spring, I received the same shocked and wide-eyed response: “Be careful!” While that’s good advice for any adventure, it was difficult to convince friends and family that this trip would not at all be the same thing as actually climbing Mount Everest.
Instead, the Everest Base Camp Trek provides an opportunity for regular hikers like me to tackle a feasible portion of one of the most iconic climbs in the world.
Base Camp is located at 17,600 feet, well below the peak of Everest, which is 29,000 feet. Base Camp is where those planning to summit spend weeks acclimatising and preparing for their journey. It is also the furthest you can go using only your legs before other equipment like ropes and ice picks get involved.
Our eight-day journey to Base Camp began at 9,300 feet, in the small Nepalese mountain town of Lukla. There are no roads to Lukla. It is accessible only by a 30-minute plane ride from Kathmandu. When we landed, I was shocked to find the area crowded and bustling, filled with locals selling trinkets and outdoor gear, and what felt like hundreds of trekkers preparing for their climbs.
From Lukla, we wound our way up muddy paths and across dangling suspension bridges, stepping aside for herds of yak and dzo (yak/cattle hybrids) as we walked further and further into the most remote area in which I have ever hiked.
Yet, it didn’t feel that way. Small towns continued to greet us all the way up. There were lodges to stay in. There were restaurants and bars. I have photos at the world’s highest Irish pub and the world’s highest bakery. In one of the larger towns, Namche Bazaar, at about 11,200 feet, there was even a North Face store. In these towns, dozens of miles from the nearest road, all food and supplies are brought in by helicopter, porter or animal.
In addition to breathtaking, 360-degree views of the Himalayas, elaborate Buddhist monuments lie along the entire route. Every day along the trail we saw massive, intricately painted boulders and colourful stupas (structures meant to bring good karma) wrapped in multicoloured prayer flags. At one point, we even toured a large, fully functioning monastery.
The terrain itself is not as difficult as you’d expect. Anyone in good physical shape could do it, and I have done many other hikes that I found more challenging. We still climbed several thousand feet per day, but the inclines were relatively gradual. This trek, instead, should be known for its panoramic views and the unique experience of hiking through these remote mountain towns.
Of course, the trip is not without risks, but they lie in unexpected places. The flights to and from Lukla are the most dangerous part of the journey. The Lukla airport has long been considered one of the most dangerous airports in the world — and in fact, a fatal crash occurred while we were there. I tried to push the knowledge of the airport’s dangers to the furthest recesses of my mind as I boarded a tiny propeller plane bound for that very place.
The plane ride is beautiful, with mountains on all sides, but the landing is enough to put even the fiercest adventurer on edge. A standard runway is between 6,000-8,000 feet long; Lukla’s is only 1,700 feet long. It’s sloped upward to help slow the plane before it hits the solid rock wall waiting at the end of it. At the other end is a 2,000-foot drop. After landing safely, we were mesmerised watching the planes taking off for Kathmandu literally fly off the edge of a cliff.
Altitude sickness is also a concern, though if you work with an experienced guiding company as we did, they will ensure you climb up slowly to acclimatise. We had two layover days and hiked a far shorter distance each day than our bodies were capable of going. This itinerary helped us grow accustomed to the air as it grew thinner.
Hiking up slowly didn’t feel like a burden, though, as it allowed extra time to take in those jaw-dropping views. The higher I climbed, the more I felt like I could reach out and touch the shimmering, snow-capped peaks. The further we progressed, the more the mountains seemed to bend toward us like we were inside of a snow globe.
At several points, we caught sight of Everest’s majestic peak peering out from behind its neighbours. Most of Everest lies in Tibet, but the peak is in Nepal. As such, the trek to Base Camp does not actually take place on Mount Everest, but inside Sagarmatha National Park — Sagarmatha being the Nepalese name for Everest.
Each day, as we made it a little higher, the air became a little thinner and our breath a little shorter. By day eight, the time between each step I took had grown significantly. I was breathing hard. My feet were dragging and my head pounding. I trudged slowly upward, but upward nonetheless, knowing the goal was within reach.
By mid-afternoon, we hiked across the final ridge and Base Camp came into view. We had made it to the gateway to the top of the world.
Base Camp rests on a massive glacier. I high-fived my group and took in the sight of dozens of yellow tents pitched across the ice, tents belonging to those preparing for their ascent. According to my trekking guide, the glacial terrain changes so rapidly that the expeditioners have to move their tents every two weeks.
We took pictures beside the sign declaring we were there and feasted on dark chocolate almond bark to celebrate. As the afternoon clouds rolled in, we lay back and watched the mountains disappear above our heads. The cheers and squeals of more trekkers arriving filled the air as it began to snow.
It may not have been the top, but it was nonetheless a spot where most people on the planet will never set foot. I feel so lucky to have stood in that very special place, and, as I always do at the end of a hike, I feel so strong knowing it was my own two feet that got me there.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/amsterdam-sex-workers-angry-at-red-light-district-tours-ban/,"Tourists are bathed in a red glow emanating from the windows and peep shows’ neon lights are packed shoulder to shoulder as they shuffled the alleys in Amsterdam’s red light district, Netherlands, on Friday, March 29, 2019. Photo: AP
AMSTERDAM: The city of Amsterdam’s latest attempt to rein in the nuisance of over-tourism by banning guided tours of the red light district has run into opposition from some of the people it is intended to protect: sex workers.
The Dutch capital plans to ban such tours, saying they are disrespectful and contribute to congestion in the narrow, canal-side streets where scantily-clad sex workers sit behind windows to attract customers.
The first step in the new policy was taken Monday night in the red light district, with tours banned from 7 p.m.
On a recent Friday night, the problem was clear to see: Tourists bathed in a red glow emanating from the windows and peep shows’ neon lights were packed shoulder to shoulder as they shuffled through the alleys.
But sex workers’ union Proud questions whether banning tours will reduce tourist numbers and argues that guides educate visitors and encourage them to behave more respectfully toward the women.
“It could also be that now there are no guides that people just wander into the area themselves and gawk at the women behind the window and take photos because there is no one anymore to inform them how to behave or what the rules of the game are in this area,” said a sex worker who goes by the name of Velvet and is the advocacy coordinator for Proud. Velvet declined to give her real name, saying that because of the stigma attached to sex work, most sex workers use a working name or pseudonym to protect their privacy and safety.
Amsterdam’s Prostitution Information Center, which is housed in the same building as Proud, offers its own red light district tours.
The total ban on guided tours, which is planned to come into full force on Jan. 1, is another step in the city’s campaign to reduce the problems associated with over-tourism and part of a broader package of measures reining in tours in the city.
Bobien van Aalst of the Dutch tour guide association Guidor slammed the ban on tours, not just to the red light district but to other historic parts of the city. She said it means guides won’t be able to explain to tourists where Rembrandt van Rijn painted one of his first famous works or where the painter’s wife is buried.
“I mean it’s like in Paris if you’re forbidding (tours) to go to the Arc de Triomphe or the Eiffel Tower,” she said.
City Hall says that more than 1,000 tour groups per week now operate around the Old Church Square in the heart of the red light district.
“Yeah, there’s really over-tourism there — too crowded. I mean there were evenings where … residents basically couldn’t leave their homes anymore because the alleys were blocked,” the city’s deputy mayor, Udo Kock, told The Associated Press.
People who work in Amsterdam’s sex industry question whether there are more tourists, or whether similar numbers are squeezing into a red light district that has shrunk in recent years as hundreds of the sex workers’ windows have been shuttered in an attempt to diversify the narrow streets.
Kock acknowledges that not everybody is happy, but says many others are pleased that the city is tackling the tours.
The red light district is a tourist magnet, especially after dark, with crowds of people waiting to get into sex shows and visiting the Red Light Secrets Museum of Prostitution, where you can experience the windows from a sex worker’s perspective by sitting on a stool in front of a “window” onto which images are projected of men walking past and peering in.
The museum’s manager, Natascha Flipsen, agrees that guided tours help educate the visitors not just about the history of the centuries-old red light district, but also about how to treat the women who work there with respect.
And she says that tourism is good for the business.
For tourists, “this is like the once in a lifetime experience, so they visit the sex work as well of course,” Flipsen said.

A lighting strike is pictured from an aircraft at an area in Singapore. Photo: Skanda Gautam/THT
So, my brother, who lives in the US, was getting married. Arrange a visa, head to the States to attend the wedding — that’s a lot of work. I thought I’d just wish him from here. A few days later, a Viber group was created including me and other children from my maternal family, and all of my mother’s sisters — eight in total. Now the wedding would take place in Bali, Indonesia. Wow a ‘Destination Wedding’!
More excited than ever, I agreed that I was going. So I started saving, and yes the time finally came.
I took leave from office for 10 days, booked the tickets for my mother and me, and started packing. When I left my house and reached the airport, it didn’t feel like I was actually going to Bali, but when I sat on the plane, I realised that my journey had begun. The flight, which was pretty chilled with a couple of beers, was of around four hours to Singapore, our transit point.
Then through tough Singapore security, helped by Starbucks coffee and a coconut drink, we were finally on our way to Bali.
So Bali. What can I say? The first thing that crossed my mind is ‘hot and sweaty’. As we got the hang of the weather, we found our guide, and an hour’s drive to the villa.





The sight along the way was awesome — statues of Hindu deities were around every street and corner. And you could see beautiful hand-carved statues of Ganesha and other deities in the shops, a breathtaking scene, their faith in religion, how they worship the gods.
I later found out that they are so religious that all of Bali was closed for two days for New Year’s prayers a day before we arrived. They meditate and pray at temples and their homes.
The villa was like a dream house with a swimming pool. The first thing I did was leave my baggage and go to a local pub for some chilled beers. The most popular and loved beer was Bintang, which cost 25,000 rupiah a bottle — shocking at first, but I later realised it’s around Rs 200.
People from all over the world, especially Australians come here to surf.
The weather is humid, so you sweat like crazy. It is constant summer with no winter, and even the metrology can’t predict rainfall. So it’s mandatory to spend your day in the pool with yes, chilled beer.
The local food was amazing, and hospitality commendable. The beautiful sunset by the ocean added to our first few days making everything surreal.
We also went for Luwak coffee tasting where they give you different drinks of flavoured tea and coffee, which was all free until you wished to drink the world’s most expensive coffee — Luwak animal poop coffee. The process to extract the poop was amazing using traditional hand method of collection to packing. A small cup cost us around 350,000 million Indonesian rupiah, and to buy a small pack I spent nearly 750,000 million rupiah, a gift for my dad that equals around $80. Crazy right? And it was really strong too.
The monkey temple was cool, more like a jungle with amazing sculptures of deities and filled with monkeys, better looking than the ones from Nepal. More mature looking I must say.
Then we visited the Saroswati Temple famous for its lotus blooms. Most people come for wedding photo shoots.
I also pampered myself to a fish spa for my feet. So ticklish!
Then the big day arrived — everything had to be Nepali style, the groom in a car to the wedding temple to the attire to the wedding dance janti. People were amazed, a few even made attempts to film the wedding.
About 50 guests attended the wedding.
The temple where the wedding was held was a massive one dedicated to Lord Shiva. The rituals were in Sanskrit language and I couldn’t understand any of it! The ritual was short as compared to Nepal, the ceremony concluded in just around two hours.
My brother had hired an amazing wedding planner. The ceremony was for two days — mehendi night at our new villa by the beach with black sand, a Jacuzzi and a swimming pool and breathtaking view of the surfers. The whole night was a blast with no sleep where my phone dived into the pool and died. Sad story but …
The next day was the wedding — early morning ceremony by the ocean and janti in 1940s classic vehicle headed towards the temple where the ceremony took place. The reception took place in the evening where a Balinese fire dancer showcased all kinds of acts and fire tricks. The decoration was beautiful with all the lights reflected by the pool of our villa.
We had heard of the popular Bali swing, so the last day we spent seeing that and other sites and shopping places.
Though we had a few mishaps  — a few had their luggage arriving a day late, one bashed his head swimming at 3:00 am, one broke his leg, my aunt lost $1,200, and I dropped my phone in the pool, it was one heck of a week.
As I write this story, I still feel the wind, the ocean, my family’s laughter and the closeness we felt coming together from different parts of the world for a week, leaving our hectic lives behind to enjoy and be together in a beautiful new place and for such an auspicious occasion. It was an experience of a life time.

CYRENE, LIBYA: Graffiti covers the walls of a Greek amphitheatre in Cyrene, an ancient ruined city in eastern Libya now struggling with neglect, vandals and illegal confiscation of land by locals.
The deserted souvenir shops and cafes on the mountainous road leading to the 2,600-year-old site are the only reminders that this used to be a major tourist destination.
Looting has hit Libya’s archaeological sites since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 when the country descended into turmoil with rival administrations competing for control.
Cyrene is one of five of UNESCO’s World Heritage sites in the North African country listed for their outstanding value. Others include the ruins of the Roman city of Leptis Magna, and Sabratha, both in western Libya.
Apart from Cyrene, some 200 km (124 miles) east of Benghazi, the east of the country has the Apollonia site just 20 km away.
With tourists gone and the antiquities department complaining about budget shortages, vandals have smeared graffiti on columns and looted artefacts.
Some treasures such as heads or entire torsos of statues listed in guidebooks issued in 2011 are no longer there.
“Many artefacts have been smuggled abroad,” said Ahmad Hussein, the head of the antiquities department of a parallel administration in charge of eastern Libya.
Unable to prevent theft, his department has been registering artefacts, a process which has helped to recover some in Europe, he said.
There was better site protection before 2011, but excavation at the site, in fact, dates back to Italian rule — the colonialists’ equipment can still be seen. The last Italians left the east in 1943 following their military defeat when the region came under British administration.
“There has been a lot of destruction in recent years,” said Ismail Miftah, a farmer living next to Cyrene. “Ordinary people don’t appreciate the ancient heritage.”

KATHMANDU: Four Sherpa climbers who got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Mt Makaulu Base Camp in two-metre deep snow in Sankhuwasabha for over a week shared that the high route of the Great Himalaya Trail witnessed an unusual snowfall in this winter season.
Four climbers – Pemba Jangbu Sherps, Darinji Sherpa, Pemba Rinji Sherpa and Pasang Gelu Sherpa were rescued by a Kailash Air helicopter on Monday as they ran out of food in the mountain area while embarking on a trek namely “German Nepal Friendship: The Great Himalaya Trail in Winter”.
It was really an unusual snowfall in the region, one of the team leaders Pemba Jangbu shared.
“We had to to turn around due to heavy snow in the Barun-Valley in Sankhuwasabha this season,” he said, recounting that as this is was a friendship project between Nepal and Germany the crew continued to Barun Dobhan trying to reach the high passes – Sherpani Col 6,110m, West Col 6,100m and Amphu Labtsa 5,700m – to cross into Khumbu.
“This is not only the story of the first ever attempt of the GHT High Route in winter but a story about German-Nepali friendship,” German Geographer Hannes Kuenkel, who is also a leader of the team, added.
This year the crew regrouped and was joined by seven experienced Sherpa – Darinji, Pemba Rinji, Pasang Gelu, Dafuri, Pasang Dawa, Phurba Sonam, Pasang Tendi – from Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Municipality-1, Solokhumbu, German photographer Martin Poetter and Austrian videographer Julia Brunner.
As they started their trek from Olongchun Gola where they had to break up last time and then crossed the snowy Lumbha Samba Pass (5,175m), the team reached Arun Valley on January 11.
“As all routes up to Makulu Base Camp were very difficult we tried the High Route above Hongon up to Malun Pokhari at 4,000m and we had experienced heavy snowfall and up to two feet high snow which made it impossible to hike with heavy loads,”  Kuenkel said.
As the weather was very unpredictable and the route not marked or built the team decided to take their only chance for the High Route by splitting the group in Gadhi on January 19 and sending the four strongest Sherpas led by Pemba Jangbu with only minimum equipment and light packs via Keke La pass (4,100m) towards the high passes while the others returned to Tumlingtar and flew via Kathmandu to Namche to meet up with the crew again, according to him.
The plan was that the Germans met the Sherpa again in Khumbu and together finished the Eastern part of the GHT via the icy Trashi Labtsa Pass (5,777m).
“Unfortunately the weather became worse and the Sherpa team got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Makaulu Base Camp in up to two-metre deep snow and the crew experienced 120 hours of continuous snowfall between January 22 (1pm) and January 28 (1am).”
On January 24, the snowfall stopped for 13 hours but the helicopter could not start from Kathmandu due to bad weather there. Pemba Jangbu who led over 26 expeditions told that he never experienced this kind of snowfall before. “On 28th January, a helicopter rescue was successful. It was just in time as the crew run out of gas and food.”
This winter the extraordinarily heavy snowfall did not allow the team to continue. So the team returned to Kathmandu were they stay together as friends and already prepare plans for a next attempt, according to Kuenkel, who visited Nepal for 15 times.
The two expedition leaders Pemba Jangbu and Kuenkel mentioned that they continued this project for three reasons: to promote trekking in Nepal, make people sensitive for the consequences of global warming and demonstrating how strong and powerful the international friendship can be.
According to team members, Pemba Jangbu, also owner of IAM Trekking & Expeditions and the German Geographer Hannes met during an Everest North Side Expedition which was shattered by the big earthquake in 2015.
In January 2017 they started the first attempt of the GHT High Route in winter. As the eastern part of Nepal has the highest mountains and passes they decided to take that challenge first and go from East to West starting in Taplejung.
They went up to Pangpema BC of Kantschendzonga, crossing the Nango La (4700m) to Olangchung Gola. That year the German became heavily sick in Olangchung Gola and had to give up early.

BANGKOK: Thailand approved marijuana for medical use and research on Tuesday, the first legalisation of the drug in a region with some of the world’s strictest drug laws.
The junta-appointed parliament in Thailand, a country which until the 1930s had a tradition of using marijuana to relieve pain and fatigue, voted to amend the Narcotic Act of 1979 in an extra parliamentary session handling a rush of bills before the New Year’s holidays.
“This is a New Year’s gift from the National Legislative Assembly to the government and the Thai people,” said Somchai Sawangkarn, chairman of the drafting committee, in a televised parliamentary session.
While countries from Colombia to Canada have legalised marijuana for medical or even recreational use, the drug remains illegal and taboo across much of Southeast Asia, which has some of the world’s harshest punishments for drug law violations.
Marijuana traffickers can be subject to the death penalty in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.
But in Thailand, the main controversy with legalisation involved patent requests by foreign firms that could allow them to dominate the market, making it harder for Thai patients to access medicines and for Thai researchers to access marijuana extracts.
“We’re going to demand that the government revoke all these requests before the law takes effect,” said Panthep Puapongpan, Dean of the Rangsit Institute of Integrative Medicine and Anti-Aging.
Some Thai advocates hope that Tuesday’s approval will pave the way for legalisation for recreational use.
“This is the first baby step forward,” said Chokwan Chopaka, an activist with Highland Network, a cannabis legalisation advocacy group in Thailand.

BERLIN: More than 6 million visitors, 7.5 million liters of beer, 124 rotisserie oxen and Bill Clinton in lederhosen; another Oktoberfest in Munich has come and gone.
Festival organizers say good fall weather helped attract 100,000 more people to the annual event than last year; in all, 6.3 million from about 70 countries. That’s despite this year’s Oktoberfest running only 16 days — two fewer than in 2017.
Former US President Clinton and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showed up Friday night — he dressed in traditional Bavarian garb and she in a trademark pantsuit.
Security guards confiscated 101,000 liter-size beer mugs from sticky-fingered guests seeking souvenirs. Munich authorities cleaned up 95 tons of garbage during the festival that ended Sunday.

MEDORA: For travelers looking to visit all 50 states, North Dakota is often one of the last to be checked off. It’s not exactly on the way to anywhere else, and flying there is expensive.
It ended up being 49th on my 50-state quest (sorry, Idaho!). Part of the challenge was deciding what to do there and how to get there. I had to choose between visiting Fargo in eastern North Dakota (and the name of one of my favorite movies) or Theodore Roosevelt National Park in the west.
It’s 330 miles (530 kilometers) between them, and I didn’t have time for both on a week-long road trip that also included Montana’s Glacier National Park and Idaho’s Craters of the Moon.
In the end, Roosevelt Park won out. Photos of its badlands and prairies enchanted me, and the story of Teddy Roosevelt’s sojourn there following the deaths of his wife and mother on the same day intrigued me.
What was it about this place that allowed this future president to grieve and recover — while at the same time inspiring him to become one of America’s most influential conservationists? I needed to see it for myself.
GETTING THERE
My husband and I flew to Denver — by air from New York, the cheapest jumping-off point — and rented a car (unlimited mileage, of course). We then drove 600 miles (965 kilometers) north through Wyoming and South Dakota to the tiny North Dakota town of Medora (population 132), at the entrance to the park’s South Unit.
Fortunately, those 600 miles were easily done in a day, thanks to speed limits of 75 and 80 mph (120-128 kph) in many spots, and little traffic outside Colorado. Still, it felt like we were heading to a pretty remote place, and I wondered if the park would hold its own against national parks I’d visited in Alaska, Hawaii and the Southwest, not to mention Yellowstone and Yosemite.
About 700,000 people visit Roosevelt Park yearly, compared to the more than 3 million annual visitors at places like Montana’s Glacier Park.
THE LOOP AND WILDLIFE
Teddy Roosevelt Park is open 24 hours daily. We arrived at 7:30 a.m. one day at the tail end of last summer. Map in hand, we drove the 36-mile (58-kilometer) scenic loop around the park’s South Unit, stopping at many of the nearly 20 points of interest along the way.
Within minutes, we came upon a prairie dog town. Dozens of the tiny creatures scampered back and forth, popping in and out of little holes amid scrubby grasses. We’d see three more prairie dog towns before we completed the loop, along with wild horses grazing on a hill by the roadside and in another spot, a herd of bison.
The wildlife encounters were thrilling and unexpected surprises.
THE LANDSCAPE
The landscape was thrilling too. The scent of sage perfumed the air, and bursts of red foliage punctuated the gray-green grasslands. Stripes of peach, cream and mud-brown earth and stone lined the curving banks of the Little Missouri River.
Framing it all were the famous badlands stretching to the horizon: flat-topped stone formations with striated slopes in tawny yellows and russet reds, dotted with bright green trees and patches of grass. They looked like the crusty paws of some massive alien creature on the verge of rising up.
We did most of the hikes along the loop drive, some just a few minutes’ walk to an overlook, others 20 to 40 minutes along hilly trails covering a mile or more. At every stop, we were awed by the scenery, from the astonishing palette of earthy hues to the stone shapes etching land and sky.
ROOSEVELT’S STORY
An exhibit at the visitor center tells Roosevelt’s story. On his first visit in 1883, he hunted bison and invested in a ranch near Medora. He’d been a state assemblyman in his native New York, but after his mother and wife both died on Feb. 14, 1884, he left politics and returned to the badlands to mourn his losses.
He lived in a small ponderosa pine cabin now located just steps from the visitor center. It’s furnished with period pieces and some of his belongings, including his traveling trunk, a replica of his writing desk and a rocking chair.
Roosevelt lived the cowboy life, spending days riding and herding in what was considered America’s last frontier. His experiences there were formative: He lost more than $24,000 when blizzards decimated the cattle he’d invested in. He witnessed the environmental damage done by overgrazing. And he realized that the bison, who once roamed the plains in the millions, had dwindled to the hundreds.
Roosevelt wrote three books inspired by his Western sojourn. He eventually returned to politics, serving as New York governor and from 1901-1909, as US president. His accomplishments included the conservation of 230 million acres of land, a legacy that led to the creation of the National Park Service in 1916.
For me, Roosevelt Park ranks among the most interesting and beautiful I’ve seen. I wish I hadn’t waited so long to visit, and I hope someday to go back and absorb more of the place that Roosevelt called “a land of vast silent spaces — a place of grim beauty.”

DENPASAR, INDONESIA: The Indonesian tourist island of Bali closed its international airport Friday, stranding thousands of travelers, as the Mount Agung volcano gushed a 2,500-meter (8,200-feet) column of ash and smoke.
The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said nearly 450 flights were canceled, affecting some 75,000 people.
The regional Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Darwin, Australia, said winds would carry the ash southwest toward Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island. Volcanic ash is a potentially deadly threat to aircraft that can cause engines to “flame out.”
The volcano began belching ash and smoke on Thursday and several airlines canceled inbound and outbound flights scheduled for the evening.
“We hadn’t a place to stay for the night so we had to find something else, just took a taxi and stayed at a random hostel,” said a stranded German backpacker who identified herself as Louisa. “We hoped that we could leave this morning, but the airport is closed,” she said.
Two small airports, at Banyuwangi and Jember in eastern Java, also closed because of the ash threat.
Agung’s alert level has not been raised and an exclusion zone around the crater remains at 4 kilometers (2.5 miles).
The disaster agency said the closure of Bali’s airport is in effect until 7 p.m. It said the situation will be reviewed at midday.
Australia’s national airline Qantas said in a statement that it’s “currently not safe” to operate Bali flights.
It said it was monitoring advice from the ash advisory center and its own pilots and meteorologists would decide when flights can resume.
The volcano, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) northeast of Bali’s tourist hotspot of Kuta, last had a major eruption in 1963, killing about 1,100 people.
It had a dramatic increase in activity last year, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, but had quietened by early this year. Authorities lowered its alert status from the highest level in February.
Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Government seismologists monitor more than 120 active volcanoes.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: Once a pristine Thai paradise, the secluded bay made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie “The Beach” has been exhausted by mass tourism. Now it’s getting a break.
After Friday, the daily influx of dozens of boats and thousands of visitors unsuccessfully scrambling for an unspoiled view of Maya Bay’s emerald waters and glistening white sand will end. The attraction is being closed for four months to give its coral reefs and sea life a chance to recover.
Thailand has promoted unfettered tourism for decades and the onslaught on Maya Bay, which is on Phi Phi Leh Island in the Andaman Sea, has only picked up pace in recent years. Authorities now say they are striving to balance profit and conservation and the closure will happen every year.
It is part of a rethink happening globally about unrestricted tourism that brings in big dollars but damages historic sites, harms the environment and often alienates locals.
Last month, the Philippines began a six-month closure of popular Boracay Island, whose waters President Rodrigo Duterte described as a “cesspool.” Venice, the famed Italian lagoon city that lives off tourism, installed gates at two access bridges during a four-day holiday in April so it could turn back visitors if numbers became overwhelming.
Many of Thailand’s marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October during the monsoon season but because of Maya Bay’s popularity, it hasn’t had a break since a Hollywood crew set foot on its sands in 1999 to film the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland. Its corals have been decimated by the suffocating clouds of sand and sediment churned up by speedboats.
“I tried to push this campaign for many, many years, but you know in Thailand we are a tourism industry country and we need a lot of money, so before not so many people listened,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine biologist and member of a government committee on development and the environment.
“It should have been done 10 years ago but at least it has been done,” he said.
Thailand had about 35 million international visitors last year, a five-fold increase in little more than two decades.
Shi Pengfei, among the last tourists to visit Maya Bay before its closure, said he had no idea that there would be so many people on the beach.
“I feel that there are so many people here,” said Shi, from Henan, China. “The government’s plan to close off the beach for a few months is only natural because the ocean needs a break, a chance to recover, so that the next generation can have a better and even more beautiful destination.”
But locals aren’t entirely happy. The head of the Phi Phi Tourist Business Association, Watrapol Jantharo, said he was surprised when the closure was announced in March by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
He said locals were under the impression that Maya Bay would only be closed to boats, while visitors would still walk to the bay from the other side of the island.
“We are not against protecting our environment,” he said. “We know full well that Maya Bay is our important resource, like a rice field to a farmer, but we wish there are more communications about the government’s plan before the decision was made.”
Thon, however, said the plan was discussed with locals for three years before a decision was made.
“In the past, we made some mistake because we think that the money is very important. But now we are trying to change our idea,” he said. Overseas visitors are “very important to our country, but the most important thing is our national resource. We have to preserve and hand it to the next generation.”
The government has set a limit of 2,000 tourists a day when the bay reopens — about half the current number. Boats will no longer be allowed to anchor but must dock on the opposite side of the island.
“Now that the government has this plan, we can’t change it. But we could use this opportunity to tell the world that we do not just have Maya Bay. There are 10 other beautiful beaches and islands around here that tourists can enjoy,” said Watrapol.
Thailand’s efforts to protect certain islands after decades of unregulated tourism began about three years ago under the current military junta, which has banned the types of protests such moves may have sparked had they been announced by civilian governments.
Yoong Island, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Tachai Island in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off-limits to tourists since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said he was amazed by the results. Waters that were devoid of fish are now teeming, he said, and there is about 10,000 square meters (107,600 square feet) of newly recovered coral off one of the islands.
At Maya Bay, park rangers have been preparing a coral propagation program, attaching it to rocks that will be placed in the bay once the tourists are gone.
“We’re almost certain that something good will happen in Maya Bay,” Thon said.

BANGKOK: The daily hordes of tourists have exhausted the Thai beach made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie.
Maya Bay, on Phi Phi Leh island in the Andaman Sea, will be closed to all visitors for four months annually starting this June to allow for the recovery of the battered coral reefs and sea life. The decision to keep visitors away was made Wednesday by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
“It’s like someone who has been working for decades and has never stopped,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a prominent marine scientist and member of Thailand’s national strategy committee on environment development. “Overworked and tired, all the beauty of the beach is gone. We need a timeout for the beach.”
Many Thai marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October, but because of tourist demand, Maya Bay has remained open year-round since a Hollywood crew set foot there in 1999 to film “The Beach,” the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland.
The beach receives an average of 200 boats and 4,000 visitors each day. Recent surveys by a team led by marine biologists found a large part of the coral reefs around the area is gone and sea life has virtually disappeared.
Other Southeast Asian beach resorts are under threat too.
In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has vowed to close Boracay, a small central island popular for its powdery white sand beaches and vibrant nightlife, saying it has become a “cesspool.”
“Their waste would go directly to the ocean. The germ content is already very high there,” Duterte said last week. “It only looks good because of the white coastline.”
His top environmental officials say Boracay may be closed in the last week of April after a 30-day notice is issued and the tropical island placed under a state of calamity to allow the government to extend emergency funds to affected villagers and establishments.
During the closure, which could last six months or less, a massive cleanup is planned and noncompliant beach resorts and other establishments would have to install waste treatment and disposal systems to halt further contamination. Boracay drew more than 1 million tourists last year mostly from Asia, the United States and Europe.
Boracay officials may face administrative cases for allowing environmental laws to be breached for years and for failing to regulate the influx of tourists beyond the island’s capacity.
Thon said the Thai beach’s temporary closing will kick-start the rehabilitation process.
“If you ask me if it is too late to save our islands, the answer is no. But if we don’t do something today, it will be too late,” said Thanya Netithammakum, head of the National Parks and Wildlife Department.
When Maya Bay reopens, the department will set a daily limit of 2,000 tourists, while boats will no longer be allowed to anchor there and will have to dock on the opposite side of the island at floating piers.
The number of visitors the beach has been seeing is unsustainable, and a temporary closure is better than nothing, Thon said.
“The locals know that and we all know that,” he said. “This would be a good way to start managing our tourist destinations. And we can improve on what we learn after the first year. We know that it’s important we manage our resources well. It’s not about more numbers of tourists but about sustainable tourism that benefit locals as well.”
More than 35 million tourists visited Thailand last year, compared to around 10 million when “The Beach” premiered in 2000.
Thai authorities have in the past closed off islands ruined by mass tourism. Koh Yoong, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Koh Tachai, in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off limits to tourists permanently since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said the results have been amazing. Areas with a bleak sea life environment and coral bleaching are now teeming with robust and colorful sea life and coral, he said. He’s certain that the annual closure will also help restore Maya Bay.
“I have always dreamt that one day we could work to bring her back to life. I have been following and working on Maya Bay for more than 30 years. I had seen it when it was a heaven and I see it when it has nothing left. Anything that we can do to bring this paradise back to Thailand is the dream of a marine biologist,” he said.

IFEROUANE: Tuaregs in northern Niger are hoping to draw tourists back to the region by putting their traditional dances, music poetry and camel races on display.
Despite concerns about Islamic extremism throughout the Sahel region in West Africa, organizers recently hosted more than 1,000 visitors to a cultural festical in Iferouane, a village in Niger’s far north.
“Without tourism, our youth risks falling into idleness and misery, and will join the wave of migration to Europe,” said Mohamed Houma, the mayor of the town located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the central city of Agadez.
The Air festival, considered one of the most important gatherings to celebrate the culture of the Tuareg people, has been held since 2001.
It was marked last month by the sound of tende, the Tuareg style of music and drumming, as the women and men, on foot and on their camels, participated in song and dance competitions.
Since 2001, the gatherings have been held to celebrate the culture of the semi-nomadic Tuareg people. More than 2 million Tuaregs live in the Sahara Desert area, stretching across Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria and Tunisia.
Niger’s Air region, with oases, mountains and sand dunes, has been a destination for adventurous Western tourists since the 1980s and the visitors have been a financial boon for the region. But the tourism has dwindled since the Tuareg rebellion, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, and from the proliferation of armed and extremist groups in the Sahel region.
Security guards watched over the dozen French and Belgian tourists who participated this year’s in Air Festival.
“We are very happy because this festival shows the rest of the world that despite the international geopolitical and security context, we live here in peace, sheltered from the upheavals of some of our neighboring countries,” Houma said.
French tourists to the festival this year included Jacques Maire, a French legislator who heads a France-Niger Friendship group in the French National Assembly.
While the situation in Niger is tense, he said it is not the worst in the region.
“There has always been a strong French appetite for the Sahara,” said Maire. “We must seize every opportunity to recreate tourist flows.”

PHOENIX: Arizona officials on Friday guaranteed that Grand Canyon National Park will remain in full operation if Congress fails to pass a budget and a government shutdown ensues.
Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said the state’s top tourist attraction “will not close on our watch, period.”
Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak says the state’s parks and tourism agencies plan to provide up to $100,000 to ensure lodging, campgrounds and restaurants remain open, and more funding if needed.
The state agencies have been working with the National Park Service to plan for a possible shutdown as early as Saturday if Congress fails to pass a government funding bill. The House passed a temporary government funding bill Thursday night, but the Senate was deadlocked.
President Donald Trump and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer met Friday afternoon in an eleventh-hour effort to avert a shutdown. The impasse is over federal spending and legislation to protect some 700,000 younger immigrants from deportation.
“If Washington, D.C. won’t function, Arizona will,” Ducey said in a statement. “Don’t change your travel plans, because Arizona is open for business — regardless of what happens back in Congress.”
The U.S. Interior Department said national parks and other public lands will remain as accessible as possible if a shutdown happens. That’s a change from previous shutdowns, when most parks were closed and became high-profile symbols of dysfunction.
But spokeswoman Heather Swift said services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds, full-service restrooms and concessions won’t be operating in most locations.
Arizona’s decision to guarantee funding to cover the cost of those services means they should operate at the Grand Canyon as normal if a shutdown occurs.
Arizona paid about $100,000 a day to cover the full cost of keeping the Grand Canyon open during the last shutdown in 2013 but was eventually reimbursed by the federal government. Former Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, worked to pay the National Park Service $651,000 to keep the popular tourist destination open for a week. That came after a shutdown that lasted more than a week.
Federal lawmakers reached an agreement on the budget before those seven days were up.
During a 1995 shutdown, Arizona’s governor famously led a convoy of unarmed troops to the park’s gate to demand it be opened.
They were met there by the park superintendent, who negotiated with then-Gov. Fife Symington, a Republican, for a partial reopening if the budget impasse continued.
The shutdown was briefly solved, but when the parks were again closed a month later, the state paid more than $17,000 a day to keep the road to the Grand Canyon Village and the Mather Point scenic viewpoint on the canyon’s South Rim open.

LAMJUNG: A number of domestic tourists visiting a historical site of Rainaskot in Lamjung district has increased significantly.
Home stay, started after renovation of an earthquake affected houses are now packed with the domestic tourists. It is being run in a total of 14 houses which are built with the modern techniques where 84 tourists can be accommodated at once.
The concept of home stay in Rainaskot begun with American national Natasha Wajniyak providing a fund of Rs 20.75 million to renovate the quake affected houses according to Sarbodaya Old Age Home’s Chairperson Krishna Raj Oliya.
One of the home stay entrepreneurs in Rainaskot, Dilmaya Gurung informed that the domestic tourists are also provided the opportunities of observing the local cultural programs during their stay.
“Besides, tasting the local organic foods, domestic tourists also can experience the local cultures,” said Gurung. Since the Rainaskot has a big Gurung population, a museum related to that caste also has been established.
Meanwhile Rainaskot Tourism Committee’s Chairperson Khadak Bahadur Gurung expressed his hope of attracting even bigger number of the domestic tourists in the future. Visitors can reach the site after two hours of bus ride and three hours of hike from Paudi, a gateway of Lamjung district.
Mesmerizing views of 18 mountain ranges including Annapurna and Machchapuchhre can be seen from the Rainaskot.

MADRID, SPAIN:  A passenger on a delayed Ryanair flight from London who apparently got fed up waiting to get off a plane after it landed in the southern Spanish city of Malaga surprised fellow passengers by using the emergency exit to jump onto a wing.
The incident on New Year’s Day took place 30 minutes after the flight from Stansted Airport landed.
The man, who has not been named but is said to be a non-Spanish citizen, was coaxed back onto the plane while police were called.
Fellow passenger Fernando del Valle Villalobos, who videoed the incident, said he heard the man say he got fed up waiting.
“I was astonished,” del Valle, 25, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
He said the passengers were standing in the aisle waiting to get off the plane when the man “very calmly asked permission to get past, opened the emergency exit, looked out, saw the wing, went back for his back-pack.”
Later, he said the captain came out and asked the man why he had done it and del Valle heard him say clearly that he was sick of waiting inside. The passengers, except the man in question, were kept a further 15 minutes on the plane before being let off.
Police said Wednesday that they have opened a complaint against the man for breaching security.
Ryanair said the incident was now in the hands of Spanish authorities.

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA: While much of the nation shivers in bone-aching cold, people in Alaska’s largest city are basking in warmer weather, jogging in short sleeves, ice-skating in T-shirts or walking dogs while just lightly bundled up.
Anchorage saw an official high of 44 degrees Tuesday, tying the record set in 1981 and 2011. That was warm enough for Patricia Bierer, who was visiting Alaska this winter from Montana.
“I am from the Bitterroot Valley in Montana, and it’s colder there today than it is here in Alaska,” said Bierer, dressed in a pink parka as she strolled with family members around Anchorage’s Westchester Lagoon. “And my children that are there are jealous because I’ve got 40-degree temperatures here.”
National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Kurtz said areas of high and low pressure are working together to push tropical air to the north. But temperatures are expected to begin dropping Tuesday night, and below freezing by Wednesday. That freeze-thaw vacillation should bring slick conditions to the area.
“I jokingly refer to it as freezy, skid stuff,” Kurtz said.
It comes as the weather service issued wind chill advisories and freeze warnings covering a vast area, from South Texas to Canada and from Montana to Maine.

A large swath of the US is freezing under Alaska-like weather, but parts of the nation’s northernmost state itself are basking in balmy conditions. Tuesday’s official temperature hit a record 45 degrees in Anchorage. (Jan. 2)

The unseasonable temperatures brought Anchorage resident Cassandra Sullivan out to walk her pit bull Athena along downtown streets. She said it helped jolt her out of the winter blues.
“For some reason, with the weather out today as it is and just the breeze and the warm air, it kind of brings me out of it,” she said.
Ashley Durst, walking her dog at the downtown lagoon during her lunch break, admitted that the warmer weather was a little unusual because it can be minus-30 this time of the year.
But she doesn’t mind that others are feeling that bite instead. “I just think maybe it’s time they get their little taste of it for a while,” she said with a smile.

LAS VEGAS: Las Vegas welcomed 2018 with fireworks, big-ticket musical acts and unprecedented security in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in US modern history just three months ago.
Law enforcement officers kept a close eye Monday on the estimated 330,000 people who traveled from all over the US and beyond to pack in the Las Vegas Strip and downtown’s Fremont Street. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had every officer working throughout the weekend and was aided by the Nevada National Guard and federal agents.
Rosy-cheeked visitors took selfies and livestreamed the celebration amid temperatures in the mid-40s (4 Celsius), much warmer than most of the US. They wore glittery hats, tiaras and other 2018-themed paraphernalia as they hugged and cheered on the new year.
“One bad incident is not going to deter us from having a good time,” Honolulu resident Pettra Stark, who planned her trip after the Oct. 1 shooting, said while standing underneath the massive video canopy on Fremont Street.
For Stark, the heavy presence of armed officers was reassuring. But not everyone felt the same way, including Adrian Dominguez, who traveled for the festivities with 10 other relatives.
“It’s not pleasant to see so many officers,” Dominguez, a resident of the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Juarez. “They are everywhere.”
The heightened security comes after a high-stakes gambler killed 58 and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below before killing himself.
On Saturday, two security guards were fatally shot while investigating a disturbance at Arizona Charlie’s Decatur, a hotel-casino just west of the Strip. Police said the suspect was hospitalized with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities described it as an isolated incident and assured that it was not terrorism-related.
A roughly eight-minute fireworks display at the top of seven of the city’s world-famous casino-hotels started at the Stratosphere 10 seconds before midnight Monday and continued to Venetian, Treasure Island, Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Aria and MGM Grand. More than 80,000 pyrotechnic firings that illuminated the sky in gold, red and green.
Megastars performed at venues up and down the Strip. The Foo Fighters played at The Chelsea at The Cosmopolitan, Maroon 5 was at the Mandalay Bay Events Center and Britney Spears performed at The Axis at Planet Hollywood.
At a lower-key celebration in downtown Las Vegas’ casino-flanked Fremont Street Experience, bands played under a massive video canopy while visitors danced and sipped giant beers.
Las Vegas police officer Larry Hadfield on Monday said there were no incidents related to the festivities to speak of. The Nevada Highway Patrol on Twitter reported the arrest of two suspected impaired drivers near the Strip.
Police cruisers, dump trucks and other large vehicles blocked key intersections during the night to try to prevent anyone from plowing into crowds.
Strollers, backpacks, large bags, coolers and glass bottles were banned from the Strip for the night. Ticket holders for the celebration on Freemont Street Experienced went through checkpoints where security guards used hand-held metal detectors.
New Year’s Eve is worth an estimated $254.3 million to Las Vegas, according to the city’s Convention and Visitors Authority. More than 97 percent of the destination’s nearly 149,000 hotel and motel rooms were expected to be booked.

Canada is more than just its great mountains, wild moose-spotting road trips and craggy-coast good looks. Its endless variety of landscapes might keep you busy the first few days but what would a traveller look for beyond the great outdoors? Its captivating culture will engulf you; from west to east, a foodie’s paradise your palates would be thoroughly refreshed and thriving cities with their own artistic flair will surprise you. But if you’re looking to weave stories out of adventures for years to come here are a few places that you must check out.

Venture into the woods

If snuggled in a sphere suspended atop the forest canopy of Vancouver Island in the middle of nowhere is what excites you then a visit to the Free Spirit Spheres is a must. It’s part Middle Earth fantasy and part childhood dream, you’ll find large wooden orbs suspended from the trees. Take the spiral staircase and short suspension bridge leading up to them and enter into the sphere to experience nature from a different perspective.
Designed to look vaguely like enormous nuts or seeds, the cedar and spruce spheres borrow from and collaborate with the surrounding environment. The spheres are made of fibreglass and wood, and borrow heavily from sailboat construction methods. Inside the curving walls complete with portholes for windows, space is maximised with fold-out tables and mirrors, curved loft beds and benches, and tiny appliances. Touted as ‘the ultimate tree-house experience,’ these Free Spirit Spheres can be rented overnight.

Brace yourself

Mazes and labyrinths reached its zenith as a form in Renaissance England, more as a device for
entertainment than serious purpose. Today VanDusen Garden in Vancouver is one of only six in North America.
It carries on the tradition of Elizabethan hedge mazes in North America. The maze is made of 3,000 pyramidal cedars — Thuja occidentalis ‘Fastigiata’ to be specific was planted in the autumn of 1981 and slowly grown into the form of the maze one finds today.
Named after local lumber magnate and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen, this garden is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. In addition to the maze, the gardens cover 55 acres and displays plants from around the world. There is an observation terrace from which the less adventuresome visitor can view the maze and the struggles of its confused occupants.

For your eyes only

A book collector’s dream, The Monkey’s Paw in Toronto has the world’s first ‘Biblio-Mat’, a
random book vending machine.  All of the books lining the shelves of Stephen Fowler’s bookstore are ones you couldn’t possibly find anywhere else. He opened The Monkey’s Paw in March 2006 and since then it has been a haven for antiquarians, complete with
medical drawings on the wall and a stuffed crow on a typewriter.
The unusual store, named after a horror short story by author WW Jacobs, has a diverse range of old books. Fowler selects each book to fit these categories: the beautiful, the arcane, the macabre and the absurd. For some its charm may be the custom-made Biblio-Mat, a vending machine that will dispense a randomly selected vintage volume for $2, a surprise you might want to see for yourself.

Fairytale escape

An old world fairytale-land with over 350 fairy folk figurines hidden amongst 800-year old cedars is something that will surely lure you in. Artist Doris Needham and her husband Ernest needed a place to put her hand-sculpted cement creations, so they bought a forest in British Columbia and filled it with enchanted figures from fairytales and nursery rhymes.
When Rogers Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needhams’ unusual haven; one just cannot drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house.
The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage, or a favourite
nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. Take the Nature Walk, a 2-km walk through the lush Canadian forest, where you’ll discover many trees, including an 800-year-old cedar grove. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest tree house in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old
cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.

Jewel in the crown

As their contribution to Montreal’s 1967 World’s Fair Exposition the United States government
commissioned architect, scientist, and well-known genius Buckminster Fuller to design a pavilion for the Canadian exhibition.
Fuller, who popularised, perfected, and named the Geodesic Dome, designed a 20-storey-tall dome in the fashion of his hallmark design to represent the USA. Done in a full two-thirds sphere, rather than the typical half dome, the massive steel structure was seen and admired by over 5.6 million visitors who went into the dome to see exhibits from actual spaceships from the Apollo missions to American works of art.  The dome’s steel skeleton was fitted with a clear acrylic covering, making the structure look like a massive, glittering jewel.
When the fair ended, the pavilion remained, securing the dome’s place in Montreal’s landscape. This relic of the 67 Expo survived fire and ice; it was reopened and was re-purposed as a museum devoted to environmental action. Today the Biosphere of Montreal remains, a sturdy and beautiful example of ‘Bucky’s’ geodesic architecture.

Work of art

Comprised of 15,000 tonnes of snow and 500,000 tonnes of ice, the Hôtel de Glace is a massive undertaking, a stunning yet ephemeral work of art and architecture entirely built of snow and ice. Every winter, this unique hotel is completely redesigned and rebuilt, offering an unforgettable experience in the only hotel of its kind in North America.
Whether for a guided tour, a Nordic overnight stay, a wedding or a private function, the Hôtel de Glace is sure to dazzle visitors with its unique style and spellbinding décor. Guests can choose to enjoy a cocktail served in a glass made of ice or spend the night in one of the 44 theme rooms and suites and relax in the outdoor hot tubs and sauna.
Every inch of the hotel is created out of ice, including the furniture. To make the rooms more liveable, beds are covered with furs, blankets and sleeping bags tested to arctic temperatures. Although you might not get four-star service, the attraction has seduced over a million people around the world since its opening in 2001. Only 4-km from the north end of Québec City
a visit might just add to your Canada experience.  – Compiled

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/india-arrests-top-kashmiri-leaders-under-controversial-law/,"
JAMMU: Indian authorities have arrested two former top elected officials of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir under a controversial law that allows authorities to imprison someone for up to two years without trial, officials said on Friday.
Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah were arrested as their six-month-old detention ended Thursday, a top civil administrator and top police officers said. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to talk to reporters.
They were among thousands of people detained when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist-led government stripped Jammu and Kashmir of semi-autonomy and statehood, downgrading them into two federal territories last August.
Since, they had been held under house arrest under a preventive custody law that allows authorities to detain people who are feared might commit offenses for up to six months.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Modi gave indication of their arrest when he said in Parliament that the two leaders had in the past made statements that could incite unrest in the region.
Modi cited Mehbooba Mufti accusing India of cheating Kashmir last summer. He said Omar Abdullah had remarked that ending Kashmir’s autonomy would cause an earthquake that would separate Kashmir from India , though there is no indication Abdullah made any such statement.
“Some people here complain some leaders have been incarcerated. Mehbooba Mufti said, ‘’Kashmir made a mistake by joining India’. Are you justifying such kind of speech?” Modi said in Parliament.
Omar Abdullah’s father, Farooq Abdullah, was the first pro-India politician arrested under the Public Safety Act, under which rights activists say more than 20,000 Kashmiris have been detained in the last two decades. They are considered pro-India as they never supported Muslim-majority Kashmir’s independence from India or its merger with Pakistan.
They are the top leaders of the National Conference, the party that has governed the Indian-controlled Kashmir for decades since India and Pakistan won independence from British colonialists in 1947 and soon began fighting over control over Kashmir, a Himalayan region spread over both countries. Farooq Abdullah, also a former top elected official of Jammu and Kashmir, is an 82-year-old member of India’s Parliament.
Mufti, 60, heads the People’s Democratic Party, which was a coalition partner of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party in the region for nearly two years after the 2016 state elections. Mufti headed the coalition government.
Two former state lawmakers and party leaders, Ali Mohammed Sagar of the NC and Sartaj Madani of the PDP, also were detained under the controversial Public Security Act on Wednesday.
India and Pakistan have fought two wars over control of Kashmir which is divided between the nuclear-armed rivals by a cease-fire line. Both sides claim the Himalayan region in its entirety.
Amnesty International has called the Public Safety Act a “lawless law,” and rights groups say India has used it to stifle dissent and circumvent the criminal justice system, undermining accountability, transparency and respect for human rights.
On Friday, the main opposition Congress party slammed the government’s decision.
“Shocked and devastated by the cruel invocation of the Public Safety Act against Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and others,” said P. Chidambaram, a top party leader.
“Detention without charges is the worst abomination in a democracy. When unjust laws are passed or unjust laws are invoked, what option do the people have than to protest peacefully?” Chidambaram tweeted.
Modi’s government sent thousands of additional Indian troops last August to the Kashmir Valley, already one of the world’s most militarized regions, when it revoked Article 370, the constitutional provision that had given Kashmir some measure of self-rule.
It cut telephone communications, cell coverage, broadband internet and cable TV services for the valley’s 7 million people. It has been gradually restoring limited communications in the region.

WASHINGTON: Dispatching Cabinet secretaries across the country to woo Iowa voters. Using private cash to finance an official made-for-TV moment. Delivering a State of the Union address that doubled as a campaign kickoff speech. Holding an impeachment acquittal victory rally in the White House East Room.
President Donald Trump made clear this week that he has no qualms about using the powers of his office to court voters in an election year. As he emerges from the impeachment drama, claiming vindication, Trump appears all the more emboldened to blur the lines between public and private endeavours.

That mindset was on full display Thursday as he used the White House as the setting for a scorched-earth victory speech celebrating his acquittal by the Senate following his impeachment by the House. Just days earlier, Trump delivered a speech in front of a joint session of Congress that could have been mistaken for a low-key Trump rally, complete with partisan incantations from Republicans in the chamber of “Four more years!” Similar chants have rung out through various rooms of the White House as Trump has hosted events that took on sharply partisan tones.
Several Democratic lawmakers expressed frustration following the State of the Union that Trump went overboard on the politics in what is supposed to be a constitutionally proscribed opportunity to “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.”
“I get it — presidents use their last SOTU to make the case for re-election,” Sen Chris Murphy, D-Conn, wrote on Twitter. “But that crossed a line.”
At one point in his address, Trump announced with an Oprah Winfrey-level of drama that Philadelphia fourth grader Janiyah Davis would be getting a scholarship, allowing her to bypass her local public school.
Addressing himself directly to the little girl, seated near first lady Melania Trump in the gallery, Trump said he could “proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it is going to you and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice!”
It turns out the money wasn’t coming from any pot of state or federal dollars.
Instead, it came from the personal accounts of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Elizabeth Hill, a Department of Education spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that DeVos, who donates her annual salary to charity, would be “directly providing the scholarship for Janiyah” and that the money would go directly to the school of her family’s choosing.
Hill declined to say how Davis had come to the department’s attention.
Donald Sherman, deputy director of the nonprofit government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the arrangement “certainly could be unethical” and was “at minimum unseemly.”
”The president made it sound like this young woman was benefiting from some government program when in fact when she was benefiting from the personal benevolence of Secretary DeVos, which has a political upside for her boss,” Sherman said.
It wasn’t the only time this week that Trump’s Cabinet secretaries took a detour into political efforts.
In the lead-up to the kickoff Iowa presidential caucuses Feb 3, Trump’s campaign flooded the state with more than 80 surrogates, including a long list of senior administration officials. Among those participating: DeVos, as well as the secretaries of commerce, interior, and housing and urban development, and the acting White House chief of staff.
The campaign chartered a 737 to ferry the governmental pep squad to and from Washington.
Under federal law, civilian employees in the executive branch cannot use their titles when doing political work, so announcements about the events referred to Cabinet officials without their titles. They are also prohibited from taking part in any partisan activity while on the clock. The president and vice president are exempt from the rules.
Next week, the campaign will again be deploying top surrogates — this time to polling locations across New Hampshire, which votes Tuesday.
It’s a familiar tactic for presidents — Republicans and Democrats alike.
President Barack Obama, for instance, allowed five members of his Cabinet to address the party’s 2012 convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, as he sought reelection. But four years later, as his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, sought the White House, Obama decided to prohibit Cabinet members from taking part as he sought to separate his administration from the politics of the moment.
Obama was also accused of using other levers of the federal government to bolster his 2012 reelection chances when he took executive action to protect “Dreamer” immigrants who came to the country illegally as children. In 2012, Kathleen Sebelius, Obama’s health and human services secretary, was also cited for violating federal law prohibiting Cabinet members from engaging in politics on the clock when she called for the president’s reelection and touted the candidacy of another Democrat at an event she was attending in her official capacity.
Trump, for his part, has repeatedly stepped over the line.
The independent government watchdog Office of Special Counsel has cited the president’s top advisers on multiple occasions for violating the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in certain political activities, including playing “any active part” in a campaign.
In November 2018, the watchdog found six White House officials in violation for tweeting or retweeting the president’s 2016 campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” from their official Twitter accounts. Most notably, the office recommended in June 2019 that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway be fired.
Trump refused to take action against Conway, suggesting that the office was trying to take away her right to free speech.
Trump’s policy actions that further his political aims also have raised eyebrows, though it’s a murky area, and all presidents advance causes that are in sync with their political aims.
In the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections, as Trump was trying to energize his base voters and stanch Republican losses, the president issued dire warnings from the Oval Office about an “invasion” of migrants and deployed the US military to the southern border in what many saw as a political stunt.
More than a year ago, his administration recognised Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the nation’s legitimate president and called on socialist leader Nicolás Maduro to resign. Trump invited Guaidó to attend the State of the Union as a special guest and dedicated a moment in the address to pledging solidarity with the leader.
Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida, saw Trump’s shout-out to Guaidó as one of several carefully calibrated moments in the speech aimed at courting a specific voting bloc.
While all presidents pepper the annual address with lines that highlight groups or individuals who are important to their electoral chances, MacManus said, Trump took it to another level with a speech full of moments aimed at various blocs of voters, including African Americans, military families and conservatives.
“This was a classic example of micro-targeting of people that he thinks he needs,” MacManus said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/another-41-on-cruise-liner-off-japan-test-positive-for-coronavirus/,"
TOKYO: Another 41 people on a cruise liner off Japan tested positive for coronavirus on Friday, bringing the total confirmed cases to 61, with thousands of passengers confined to cabins as testing continues.
The cruise ship, Diamond Princess, and the roughly 3,700 people aboard have been under two-week quarantine since arriving back at the port of Yokohama, just south of Tokyo, on Monday night, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus.
The total 61 cases came from a sample of 273 people who had been tested because they were either showing symptoms or had been in close contact with those who did, according to the health ministry.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told a news conference 21 of the newly found 41 cases were Japanese. Further tests would be conducted if additional passengers on board the ship developed symptoms, he said.
Live TV footage showed blue and white hoardings put up in the vessel where passengers diagnosed with the virus were being moved out to medical facilities. The new patients would be transported to hospitals in Tokyo and neighbouring towns, the health ministry said.
The rise in the number of infections has worsened the mood for thousands of passengers stuck on the cruise, who were only allowed out for brief periods to breathe fresh air on open decks. Several had previously said they were longing to get out and see the sky.
Ashley Rhodes-Courter, an American whose parents are on the boat, said she hoped U.S. officials would be able to help her parents leave the boat.
“They are all breathing circulated contaminated air so they could be getting everyone infected,” Rhodes-Courter told Reuters.
The virus can be transmitted via droplets from an infected person exhaling, coughing or sneezing, and can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles.
Experts have said it is more easily transmitted than the SARS virus.
Separately, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said a fourth chartered flight had brought 119 more Japanese nationals and 79 Chinese and Taiwanese family members from Wuhan.
There was no immediate word on the condition of the most recent air arrivals. Three planes last week brought a total of 565 evacuees back to Japan, a handful of whom were confirmed to have the virus – including several who had not shown symptoms.
The new ship cases take the total number of coronavirus infections in Japan to more than 80, according to Reuters calculations. Health Minister Kato said Japan is not including the cruise ship cases in its national count, which stands at 21 patients.
With the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics less than half a year away, Games organisers have set up a task force to deal with the situation.
The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in mainland China reached 636 as of the end of Thursday, up 73 from the previous day, the country’s National Health Commission said on Friday.
Across mainland China, there were 3,143 new confirmed infections on Thursday, bringing the total so far to 31,161.

Doctor Li Wenliang dies in Wuhan hospital
Li was reprimanded by police after raising alarm
Chinese president declares ‘people’s war’
Death toll rises by 73 to 636
Asian economic markets fall on virus

SHANGHAI/BEIJING: A Chinese doctor who tried to warn the world about a new coronavirus died of the disease on Friday, prompting an outpouring of sorrow as the death toll passed 630 and Beijing declared a “people’s war” on the rapidly spreading pathogen.
Li Wenliang, 34, died in the early hours of the morning at the hospital where he worked and first raised the alarm about the new coronavirus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, hospital officials said.

An ophthalmologist, Li was one of eight people reprimanded by Wuhan police last month for spreading “illegal and false” information about the coronavirus, a flu-like pathogen that since triggered a global health emergency.
His messages to a group of doctors on Chinese social media warning of a new “SARS-like” coronavirus – a reference to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which killed almost 800 people around the world in 2002-2003 – triggered the wrath of Wuhan police. China was accused of trying to cover up SARS.
He was forced to sign a letter on Jan. 3 saying he had “severely disrupted social order” and was threatened with criminal charges.
Chinese President Xi Jinping had earlier sought to reassure his citizens and the world that China would beat the coronavirus.
“The whole country has responded with all its strength to respond with the most thorough and strict prevention and control measures, starting a people’s war for epidemic prevention and control,” Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying.
‘LOCAL HERO’
Many Chinese people on social media described Li as a hero and a tragic figure, charging local authorities with incompetence in the early stages of the outbreak which has now claimed more than 400 lives in Wuhan and forced the city into lockdown.
“We deeply mourn the death of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang … After all-effort rescue, Li passed away on 2:58 am, Feb. 7,” the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily tweeted.
Some Chinese media outlets described him as a “hero who was willing to speak the truth” while other commentators posted poems, photos and drawings saluting him.
“Light a candle and pay tribute to the hero,” one person posted on social media platform Weibo. “You were the beam of light in the night.”
On Friday, China’s Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, reported 69 new deaths, taking the total in China to over 600. It also reported nearly 2,500 new cases, taking the total in China to over 30,000, according to state television. Figures for all of mainland China were expected to follow shortly.
The death toll from a coronavirus outbreak in mainland China reached 636 on Friday with 73 more deaths recorded the previous day and 3,143 new confirmed infections, bringing the total so far to 31,161 cases, the National Health Commission said.
Two deaths have been reported outside China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines, but uncertainty about the lethality and contagiousness of the virus has prompted countries to quarantine hundreds of people and cut travel to and from China.
The virus continued to spread around the world, with 41 new cases reported among about 3,700 people quarantined in a cruise ship moored off Japan, bringing the total to 61 cases onboard.
In Hong Kong, another cruise ship with 3,600 passengers and crew was quarantined for a third day with three cases on board. Taiwan, which has 13 cases, banned international cruise ships from docking.
ECONOMIC ANXIETY
In China, the world’s second-largest economy, cities have been shut off, flights cancelled and factories closed, cutting off supply lines crucial to international businesses.
Anxiety over the virus and its fallout returned to financial markets on Friday, with stock indexes in China, Hong Kong and throughout Asia slipping after several days of gains. Investors are looking to Chinese trade figures due during the morning for an early glimpse of how the virus, and the harsh measures to contain it, are affecting the flow of goods.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was too early to say the outbreak was peaking.
One Chinese official said the crisis could be nearing its peak, with just over 1,300 patients discharged from hospitals, although the number of new patients diagnosed with coronavirus was still rising.
“I have full confidence that we’re going to get ahead of it,” the official said. “The biggest challenge is still to control the spread of the disease, and let all the suspected patients be cured in the hospital.”

China weighs delay to annual meeting of legislative body

SHANGHAI/BEIJING: China’s fast-moving coronavirus spread among passengers of a quarantined Japanese cruise liner on Thursday and dragged down production at more global businesses, as scientists across the world searched for a vaccine.
The death toll from the virus in mainland China jumped by 73 to 563, with more than 28,000 confirmed infections inside the workshop of the world and its second-largest economy.
Moored off Japan, about 3,700 people on Carnival’s Diamond Princess face testing and quarantine for at least two weeks on the ship, which has 20 virus cases.
Japan now has 45 virus cases.
Gay Courter, a 75-year-old American novelist on board, said he hoped the US government would take the Americans off.
“It’s better for us to travel while healthy and also, if we get sick, to be treated in American hospitals,” he told Reuters.
In Hong Kong, another cruise ship with 3,600 passengers and crew was quarantined for a second day pending testing after three cases on board.
Taiwan, which has 13 cases, banned international cruise ships from docking.
In China, cities have been shut off, flights cancelled and factories closed, shutting supply lines crucial to the world economy. Companies including Hyundai Motor, Tesla , Ford, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Nissan , Airbus, Adidas and Foxconn are taking hits.
Financial analysts have cut China’s growth outlook, with ratings agency Moody’s signalling risks for auto sales and output.
Nintendo Co Ltd said on Thursday delays to production and shipping of its Switch console and other goods to the Japan market were “unavoidable” due to the coronavirus.
Honda Motor Co was considering keeping operations suspended for longer than planned at its three plants in Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported.
Indonesia said it stands to lose $4 billion in earnings from tourism if travel from China is disrupted for the whole year.
Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, hit by months of sometimes violent anti-China, pro-democracy unrest, said the coronavirus was hurting its economy and urged banks to adopt a “sympathetic stance” with borrowers.
But global stocks extended their recovery, cheered by record closes on Wall Street and China’s announcement of a tariff cut on some imports from the United States, which analysts saw as a move to boost confidence.
China, which has bristled at being ostracised over the virus, was considering delaying an annual meeting of its highest legislative body, the National People’s Congress, from March 5, sources said.
“The situation doesn’t look likely to be contained by March,” a government official told Reuters.
RUSH FOR HIV DRUG
Several countries, including the United States, have banned entry to visitors who have been in China over the previous two weeks.
News of another virus hot spot emerged, linked to a mid-January company meeting in Singapore. At least three people caught the disease after a conference held with 94 overseas staff, including one from Wuhan.
Authorities have not identified the company, but the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was investigating.
Singapore has reported 28 infections, some involving person-to-person transmission.
Health officials in the United States and China want to get a vaccine to initial human testing within months, but drugmakers have cautioned they have a long way to go.
“There are no known effective therapeutics,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said, when asked about reports of “breakthroughs” that boosted markets on Wednesday.
China’s National Health Commision said the HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir could be used for coronavirus patients, without specifying how.
That triggered a rush, specifically for Kaletra, also known as Aluvia, which is drugmaker AbbVie’s off-patent version of lopinavir/ritonavir and the only version approved for sale in China.
Devy, a 38-year-old freelancer in Shandong province, said he was among hundreds who had contacted people with HIV to ask for medicine.
“When you are left alone, seeing the blur shadow of death far away, I think no one can feel calm,” Devy told Reuters.
Hundreds of experts will gather in Geneva on Feb. 11-12 to try to speed research into drugs and vaccines, the WHO said, adding that a multinational WHO-led team would also visit China.
National officials said 3,694 cases were reported throughout China on Wednesday, the first day in more than a week to see a fall in new daily cases.
Two deaths outside mainland China, in the Philippines and Hong Kong, have both involved visits to Wuhan, where more than 400 people have died.
Nearly 260 cases have been reported in 31 countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally.
More than two dozen airlines have suspended or restricted flights to China and hundreds of foreigners have been evacuated from Wuhan and placed in quarantine.
The virus is also stirring animosity in the decades-old dispute between self-ruled Taiwan and China, with the island complaining that China is providing the WHO with wrong information about its cases.

The private DHA news agency said one body was recovered Thursday, bringing the death toll from the two avalanches to 39.

Rescue workers, aided by dogs, were conducting scans in the eastern Van province Thursday to find the missing, according to the official Anadolu news agency.
Five people were killed and two people went missing in an avalanche that struck late Tuesday. Some 300 emergency service workers were called to a highway near the mountain-surrounded town of Bahcesaray in Van province, which borders Iran. Around noon Wednesday, the team was struck by a second avalanche.
Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said early Thursday that 47 people remained hospitalised with six in intensive care, but they weren’t in critical condition.
A ceremony was held for 11 military police officers, nine government-paid village guards and two firefighters in Van. Their coffins were sent to their hometowns for burial.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/desperate-for-coronavirus-solutions-chinese-turn-to-hiv-drugs-grey-market-and-traditional-cures/,"BEIJING: The rapidly spreading virus in China and a shortage of medical resources are prompting people to resort to unorthodox ways to obtain treatment, with some appealing to HIV patients and unauthorized importers for medicine.
Chinese health authorities have said there is not yet any effective cure for the virus, which has killed more than 500 people in China. Although there is no evidence from clinical trials, China’s National Health Commision said the HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir can be used for coronavirus patients, without specifying how they might help.

That triggered a rush, specifically for Kaletra, also known as Aluvia, which is drugmaker AbbVie’s off-patent version of lopinavir/ritonavir and the only version approved for sale in China.
It is usually used to treat and prevent HIV and AIDS, and AbbVie said last month that China was testing it as a treatment for coronavirus symptoms.
Devy, a 38-year-old freelancer in Shandong province who did not want to give his family name for fear of retaliation, said he was among hundreds who contacted people with HIV to ask for medicine.
Although he had not recently travelled to Hubei province or Wuhan, the epicentre of outbreak, he grew worried that he had somehow caught the coronavirus after a doctor’s visit found symptoms of pneumonia. He also had other symptoms associated with coronavirus, such as fever and nausea.
Desperate and worried, he heard from a friend that a HIV-positive man nicknamed “Brother Squirrel” was offering Kaletra for free to people suspected to have the new coronavirus. He received about 30 pills.
“When you were left alone, seeing the blur shadow of death far away, I think no one can feel calm,” Devy told Reuters by telephone.
Even after he was finally tested negative for the virus, Devy still believed obtaining Kaletra was the right choice. “You can only try various things to save yourself, right?”
DRUG HOARDER
Brother Squirrel, whose real name is Andy Li, told Reuters he was a 30 years old and coined his nickname because he hoards drugs for his condition the way “squirrels like to hoard nuts”.
After hearing the Chinese health authorities’ comments on Kaletra, he and a few other HIV patients pooled about 5,400 Kaletra tablets in less than a week. They then posted their offer on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo.
“We felt like we were organised for a military mission,” Li said, recalling that hundreds of messages soon flooded in, leaving him barely any time to sleep or eat in the first three days until all of the pills were mailed.
“There are so many people in need of the drug, and I don’t want to waste time,” Li told Reuters. “Time is life.”
Chinese health authorities cautioned that lopinavir/ritonavir, a prescription drug, has potential side effects such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and liver damage.
BIG PROFITS
The rush has also opened up moneymaking opportunities.
More than 28,000 people have been confirmed to be infected in China, most in Wuhan and Hubei. But a shortage of test kits has led to suspicions that many more are undiagnosed.
Gatsby Fang, a Chinese cross-border buying agent, told Reuters that he ordered generic versions of Kaletra from India on Jan. 23, shortly after he firstly heard that the drug might be useful against the new coronavirus.
Fang, whose primary job is in the financial industry, said he sold each bottle for 600 yuan ($86) each, bringing in 200 yuan to 300 yuan in profit on each. His stock was sold out by Jan 25. Some clients ordered 600 tablets at once, he said.
His buyers included infected patients, front-line doctors in Hubei, and those who did not need the drug but thought it might offer protection. Other drug sellers also approached him, pretending to be patients, Fang said.
Grey market prices for the drugs in India, where he sourced them, started to rise on Jan. 25, Fang told Reuters.
“For the 60-pill-per-bottle product, its price went up to about 300 yuan, 400 yuan from about 100 yuan in the beginning,” he said.
“Basically the patients reaching out to me were those who have no place for treatment, no place where they can confirm 100% if they have or not have the virus,” Fang said. “That’s the core of the problem.”
The World Health Organization has warned that there are “no known effective” treatments for the coronavirus, knocking down unconfirmed reports of a research breakthrough in China.
Some traditional Chinese medicine treatments have also seen a boost in demand.
There is no evidence that such treatments help in fighting the coronavirus, Gauden Galea, the WHO’s representative in China, told Reuters on Saturday.

MILAN: A high-speed train derailed in the northern Italian province of Lodi in the early hours of Thursday, killing at least two people and interrupting traffic on the line between Milan and Bologna, officials said.
Emergency services were at the scene and a railway official said two people had been killed and two others had suffered relatively serious injuries. A number of others had minor injuries.

Sky Italia television said two members of the train crew had been killed and 27 people injured.
The train skipped the tracks some 40 km (25 miles) from Italy’s financial capital Milan at around 5.30 am (0430 GMT), state railways said in a statement. It added that the causes of the accident were being investigated.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/war-weary-afghan-youth-turn-to-snowboarding-for-thrills/,"KABUL, AFGHANISTAN: Aspen! Zermatt! Kabul?
While Afghanistan’s capital may seem an unlikely destination for snowboarders, a group of young Afghans is looking to put the city on the winter sports map and change perceptions about their war-weary nation.
Kabul is better known for its hulking concrete blast walls and tense security checkpoints. But it also sits in a valley in the Hindu Kush mountains at an elevation of around 1,800 metres (5,900 feet). The rugged terrain has inspired young Afghans to take to the surrounding mountains in search of fun.

Ahmad Romal Hayat, 22, who founded the Afghanistan Snowboarding Federation, said that even a country plagued by war and sectarian conflict can have room for sports.
“We started doing it (snowboarding) to show this new face to the world,” said Hayat.
As a teenager, he started out on a skateboard. Later, he bought a snowboard in neighboring Iran and taught himself how to ride it. Hayat said he’s the first person to bring a snowboard into Afghanistan, and the first to try it there.
These days, he and handful of federation members hit the slopes outside Kabul each weekend, usually with around a dozen male and female students and plenty of spectators. They come for the free training on a snowy hillside west of the capital, often shrouded in pale grey mist.
The mountain, known as Kohe Koregh, was used by the Afghan mujaheddin, or holy warriors, to rain artillery and rockets down on Kabul during the Afghan civil war in the 1990s.
Now, it’s a place for laughing kids who sled on plastic bags, while Hayat’s team members work on improving their snowboarding skills on about 60 centimetres (2 feet) of snow.
They still have to share snowboards, and the hill has no lift facility. That means they’ve got to hike back up to the top after each run — a tiring process.
While climbing back up the hill, Karim Faizi described his path to becoming a snowboarding instructor. He fled Afghanistan in 2016 to escape the almost two-decade-old war between the US and Taliban militants.
He ended up seeking asylum in Germany where he fell in love with snowboarding. In 2018, he returned to Afghanistan, saying he did so without awaiting a final decision on his asylum case.
Now he is worried about the future.
“If the Taliban come back, it’ll be impossible to keep snowboarding, because the Taliban are not sports-friendly people. They want neither peace nor sports,” he said. A few sports, like soccer and wrestling, were allowed during the Taliban’s harsh religious rule from 1996 to 2001.
Fighting between the Taliban on one side and the United States and its Afghan government allies on the other has continued to rage, even as the US works to hammer out a peace agreement with the insurgent group. The US and the Taliban are negotiating a reduction in hostilities or a cease-fire to allow the signing of a peace agreement. That deal would open the way to a broader post-war agreement for Afghans, and allow for the withdrawal of most, if not all, US and coalition forces.
The country’s post-war future and the role of the Taliban remains unclear. The Taliban currently control or hold sway over around half the country.
Right now, the only places with enough security to offer winter sports activities are in Kabul and the central province of Bamiyan. Hayat said skiers and snowboarders haven’t been able to explore mountains with great potential in Ghazni and Wardak provinces southwest of the capital because the Taliban hold those areas.
Bamiyan province is infamous for once being home to two massive 1,500-year-old statues of Buddha carved into a mountain, which the Taliban blew up in 2001.
But Bamiyan also hosts a skiing competition each year, and the country’s small snowboarding community is set to travel there for an indoor competition on Saturday. They’re also heading east to neighboring Pakistan’s picturesque Swat valley later this month to take part in an outdoor competition.
Hayat has registered the Afghan chapter with the International Snowboard Federation, although the Afghan government offers no financial support. Faizi said he dreams of returning to train in Germany, and to one day represent Afghanistan in the Winter Olympics.
But back on the slopes of Kohe Koregh, some young Afghans were excited to simply get their first taste of snowboarding.
Zahra Hakimi, 16, is a member of the minority Hazara ethnic group. She came with friends to watch the snowboarders. She and another friend eventually decided to give it a shot.
At first, Hakimi struggled to keep her balance, but eventually managed to go 10 metres (around 30 feet) at a time without falling.
“When I see how crazy people are for this sport — girls and boys trying, falling down again and again but still keep doing it — I really believe it has a bright future,” she said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/plane-skids-off-runway-in-istanbul-killing-three-and-injuring-179/,"ISTANBUL: A Pegasus Airlines plane flying into Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen airport skidded off the end of a wet runway and broke into three pieces after landing on Wednesday, killing three people and injuring 179, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said.
The three had died in hospital, with 179 of the 183 aboard wounded, Koca told reporters in the eastern province of Van.

The wounded were being treated at 18 nearby hospitals, Ali Yerlikaya, the governor of Istanbul, had said earlier, adding that the plane was carrying 177 passengers and six crew from the western province of Izmir.
“The plane could not hold on the runway due to poor weather conditions and skidded for around 50 to 60 meters,” Yerlikaya told reporters at the airport.
The Boeing (BA.N) 737-86J split into three pieces after what Yerlikaya said was a drop of around 30 to 40 meters (98 to 131 ft) at the end of the runway. Footage showed the plane landing and continuing at a high speed off the runway.
Flights had been diverted to Istanbul Airport while the runway at Sabiha Gokcen was closed, Transport Minister Cahit Turhan said.
However, Sabiha Gokcen Airport announced the runway was reopening from 4 a.m. (0100 GMT) and its website showed flights had resumed on Thursday morning.
Pegasus (PGSUS.IS) said in a statement the plane had gone off the runway and passengers were evacuated, but a company spokeswoman gave no further details.
Broadcaster NTV said the plane had attempted to land in heavy tailwinds despite the previous two flights having held off because of the wind.
Television footage showed the plane’s fuselage, as well as a section near the tail, had broken off.
Passengers had been led out as the plane lay on a patch of grass beside the runway. Dozens of emergency response personnel escorted passengers off before carrying them away on stretchers.
Earlier footage showed part of the exterior of the plane had caught fire, which state media said firefighters had put out.
Turkish Airlines (THYAO.IS) had said it had canceled flights in and out of Sabiha Gokcen for the day on Wednesday.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/freed-from-impeachment-drama-trump-to-press-ahead-with-re-election-campaign/,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump emerged confident and ready to press on with his re-election effort on Wednesday after the Democratic-led impeachment drive that he denounced as illegitimate crashed to a halt in the Republican-led Senate.
Trump plans to speak about the issue at the White House on Thursday. A source close to the president described his address as a “vindication speech” that would combine some magnanimity with an “I told you so” tone.
Next, advisers said, Trump would proceed at full steam on his political and policy goals, throwing himself fully into his re-election campaign and efforts to fulfill promises he has made to his supporters and the electorate.

“The president is pleased to put this latest chapter of shameful behavior by the Democrats in the past, and looks forward to continuing his work on behalf of the American people in 2020 and beyond,” the White House said in a statement after the verdict.
Trump was acquitted largely along party lines on two articles of impeachment approved by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives that accused him of abusing his power by pressing Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a contender for the Democratic nomination to face him in the November 3 election, and obstructing Congress’ attempts to investigate the matter.
But he did not come out of the process unscathed.
As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made clear, the impeachment will be part of his legacy, and Republican Senator Mitt Romney’s vote to convict him on the abuse-of-power charge deprived the president of the ability to dismiss the process as entirely partisan.
But Republican officials noted record fundraising during the impeachment process, leading Trump’s re-election effort to bring in $155 million in the last three months of 2019 alone, boosted by a support base that is both pumped up and ticked off.
‘TOTAL VINDICATION’
Although the bruising impeachment battle is certain to be a factor for voters considering whether to re-elect Trump in November, his campaign is claiming victory.
“Acquittal means total vindication,” said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director. “The Democrats’ decision to move forward with impeachment will go down as the worst political miscalculation in American history.”
In a sign of confidence, minutes after senators found him not guilty, the president tweeted a video of himself with campaign signs projected well into the future, suggesting he wanted to be president for decades to come.
US presidents are constitutionally limited to two elected terms in office. Trump faced accusations of being autocratic and king-like during the Senate impeachment trial.
Trump released another video several hours later that referred to Romney as a “Democrat secret asset” and said the senator tried to “infiltrate” the president’s administration when Trump considered him for the position of secretary of state.
As the impeachment drama dragged on over the weeks, Trump gyrated between feeling upbeat and aggrieved. Advisers said he complained that his trade deal with Mexico and Canada did not get the media coverage it deserved because of the focus on impeachment.
With the threat of removal from office behind him, Trump is expected to bask in the glow of a strong economy and hammer Democrats for their efforts to take him down, even as supporters anticipate that Democrats will keep investigating him.
“I think President Trump and all of his allies are keenly aware of the fact that Democrats are going to keep this barrage up all the way through the November election,” said Jason Miller, a campaign adviser in 2016.
Trump plans to headline a rally in New Hampshire next week and more frequent rallies are expected in the coming months.

Death toll in mainland China rises by 73 to 563
10 more cases reported on cruise ship off Japan
Markets buoyed by media reports of “breakthrough” drugs
Hundreds of experts to gather in Geneva to combat virus

SHANGHAI: The death toll from a new coronavirus in mainland China jumped by 73 to 563 on Thursday, its third consecutive record daily rise, as experts intensified efforts to find a vaccine for a disease that has shut down Chinese cities and forced thousands more into quarantine around the world.
Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic, reported 70 new deaths on Wednesday and 2,987 new confirmed cases – more than 80% of the total reported by Chinese authorities. The other fatalities were in Tianjin city, the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and Guizhou province in the southwest.
Hubei province in central China has been in virtual lockdown for nearly two weeks, with its train stations and airports shut and its roads sealed off. The flu-like virus was first identified in Hubei’s provincial capital of Wuhan and is believed to have originated at a seafood market in the city.
There have been two deaths outside mainland China – in the Philippines and Hong Kong – both following visits to Wuhan.

Hundreds of foreigners have been evacuated from Wuhan and placed in quarantine centres around the world, and thousands of passengers and crew were in lockdown on two cruise ships in Asian waters.
Ten more people on a cruise liner in the Japanese port of Yokohama, south of Tokyo, tested positive for the coronavirus, NHK television reported citing the Japanese health ministry, bringing the total number of cases on board to 20.
About 3,700 people are facing at least two weeks quarantined on the ship after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man who travelled on it late last month tested positive.
One passenger using the handle @daxa_tw tweeted on Thursday that crew members had handed out medication refill request forms for those in need of medicines.
In Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers and crew were confined to their ship docked in the city for tests after three people on board had tested positive earlier.
More than two dozen airlines have suspended or restricted flights to China and several countries, including the United States, have banned entry to anyone who has been in China over the previous two weeks.
Hong Kong said all visitors from mainland China would be quarantined for two weeks, while Taiwan banned the entry of mainland residents from Thursday.
Hundreds of experts will gather in Geneva next week, on Feb. 11-12, in an attempt to find a way to fight back against the outbreak by speeding research into drugs and vaccines, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. A multinational WHO-led team would go to China “very soon”, it added.
Asked about reports of “drug breakthroughs”, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: “There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV (virus).”
While most people infected with the virus recover quickly with only mild symptoms, the virus can lead to pneumonia and other severe respiratory illnesses. It is still too early to know what its death rate will be, since there are likely to be many cases of milder disease going undetected.
China‘s National Health Commission said another 3,694 coronavirus cases were reported throughout the country on Feb. 5, bringing the total to 28,018.
More than 200 cases have been reported in 27 other countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally based on official statements.
ECONOMIC IMPACT
Many analysts cut their growth outlook for the Chinese economy, the world’s third largest, as the epidemic spread but global markets have stabilised in recent days on central bank stimulus measures and hopes for a vaccine.
The dollar gained on Wednesday and a gauge of global equity markets surged for a third day. European stocks jumped sharply, U.S. Treasury yields rose and U.S. stock index futures surged.
Nearly $700 billion was wiped off mainland Chinese stocks on Monday with many factories shut, cities cut off and travel links constricted, fuelling worries about global supply chains.
Fourteen provinces and cities, including several main industrial centres, which have announced extended business closures account for around 70% of China‘s gross domestic product and 80% of its exports, Capital Economics said in a note to clients this week.
Global carmakers have already extended factory closures in China in line with government guidelines. These include Hyundai, Tesla, Ford, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Nissan and Honda Motor
Planemaker Airbus has prolonged a planned closure of its final assembly plant in Tianjin, China, it said.
Taiwan’s Foxconn, which makes phones for global vendors including Apple, aims to gradually restart factories in China next week but could take at least a week or two more to resume full production, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
German sportswear company Adidas said it was temporarily shutting a “considerable” number of its stores in China.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the epidemic would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from a Phase 1 trade deal set to take effect this month.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the virus was adding to economic doubts.
“While the threat of a trade war between the United States and China appears to have receded, the coronavirus adds a new layer of uncertainty,” she said in Paris.

SRINAGAR: Two suspected rebels and an Indian paramilitary soldier were killed in brief fighting in disputed Kashmir on Wednesday, officials said. Government forces detained a suspected militant after the fighting.
Paramilitary officer Pankaj Singh said three militants arrived on a motorbike and fired at a patrol party on the outskirts of Kashmir’s main city of Srinagar.
Singh said the soldiers gunned down two of the militants. The third militant tried to escape and was caught after a chase, he said.
The officer said soldiers recovered a pistol and a grenade from the site of the shootout.
There was no independent confirmation of the incident.
India and Pakistan each claim the divided Himalayan territory of Kashmir in its entirety.
India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the rebels, a charge denied by Islamabad. Rebels have been fighting Indian control since 1989.
Most Kashmiris support the rebels’ demand that the territory be united either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country, while also participating in civilian street protests against Indian control.
About 70,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the ensuing Indian crackdown.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/8-rescue-workers-killed-20-missing-in-2nd-avalanche-turkey/,"ANKARA, TURKEY: A second avalanche slammed into a mountain road in eastern Turkey on Wednesday, killing at least eight rescue workers and leaving 20 others buried under the snow, a local mayor said. The emergency crew had been sent to the site to find two other people missing in a previous avalanche.
Some 300 emergency service workers were called to a highway near the mountain-surrounded town of Bahcesehir, in Van province, which borders Iran, after an avalanche struck late Tuesday, killing five people.

Meki Arvas, mayor of Bahcesaray, gave the death toll for the rescue workers. Gov Mehmet Emin Bilmez said 25 emergency service members were rescued from under the snow and hospitalized Wednesday. There was no further information on their conditions.
The first avalanche buried a snow-clearing vehicle and a minibus, killing five people and leaving two others missing. The vehicle’s operator and seven passengers escaped alive.
The second avalanche struck Wednesday as 300 emergency workers were searching for the two missing victims, private NTV television reported, adding that fog and heavy snow were hampering the rescue efforts.
The state-run Anadolu Agency said the operator, Bahattin Karagulle, was trapped beneath the snow for some 25 minutes before he managed to break a window and escape. The agency quoted him as saying that he walked toward a village before he was picked up by a vehicle and managed to seek help.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/turkey-deploys-extremists-to-libya-local-militias-say/,"CAIRO: Syrian militants affiliated with groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State group are currently being sent by Turkey to fight on behalf of the UN-supported government in Libya, according to two Libyan militia leaders and a Syrian war monitor.
Both sides in Libya’s civil war receive equipment and backing from foreign countries. But Turkey, which has long trained and funded opposition fighters in Syria and relaxed its borders so foreign fighters joined IS, has in recent months been airlifting hundreds of them over to a new theater of war in Libya.
The UN-supported government controls only a shrinking area of western Libya, including the capital, Tripoli. It’s facing a months-long offensive by forces loyal to Gen. Khalifa Hifter who is allied with a rival government based in Libya’s east. The United Nations recognizes the government in Tripoli, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, as Libya’s legitimate government because it was born out of UN-mediated talks in 2015.
Sarraj is backed by Turkey, and to a lesser degree, Qatar and Italy. Hifter receives backing from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia. Libya has the ninth largest known oil reserves in the world, and many of these countries are apparently jockeying for influence in order to control Libya’s resources.
Libyan militia leaders in Tripoli told The Associated Press that Turkey has brought more than 4,000 foreign fighters into Tripoli, and that “dozens” of them are extremist-affiliated. The two commanders spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media.
The commanders also highlighted differing opinions within the Libyan militias about accepting Syrian extremists into their ranks. One said the fighters’ backgrounds aren’t important, as long as they’ve come to help defend the capital. The other said some commanders fear the fighters will “tarnish” the image of the Tripoli-based government.
Turkey-backed militias in northern Syria have been known to include fighters that previously fought with al-Qaida, IS and other militant groups, and have committed atrocities against Syrian Kurdish groups and civilians.
The UN has repeatedly condemned the flow of weapons and foreign fighters into Libya. But the organization has not directly responded to reports and accusations by Hifter’s side that Sarraj’s government and Turkey are apparently using IS- and al-Qaida-linked extremists as mercenaries.
Turkey has not confirmed or denied reports of Syrian fighters being sent to Libya to support Sarraj, and the Turkish military did not respond to requests for comment.
However, in a televised interview last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said: “As a combat force, we will have a different team there. They won’t be from within our soldiers. Those different teams and the combat forces will work together. But our high-ranking soldiers will coordinate.” He did not elaborate.
Rumors of Turkey-backed Syrian fighters in Libya have swirled for weeks. Foreign leaders and commentators have pointed to videos circulated online that appear to show Syrians in Tripoli. In one video, a man with a Syrian accent films the dormitories where he and other fighters are living, saying “Thank God, we arrived safely in Libya.” Another clip shows a plane full of fighters, some wearing fatigues and speaking with Syrian accents.
Turkey’s Libyan allies and Syrian opposition leaders have denied any organized efforts to send combatants to Libya. But in January, Sarraj told the BBC that his government “would not hesitate to cooperate with any party to defeat this aggression” by Hifter’s forces.
Rami Abdurrahman, the director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told the AP that his war-monitoring network has determined there are at least 130 former Islamic State or al-Qaida fighters among the approximately 4,700 Turkey-backed Syrian mercenaries sent to fight for Sarraj.
He said the IS militants had joined the so-called Syrian National Army, a patchwork alliance formed by Turkey from different factions who battled the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Most of the groups are loyal to Turkey, and the SNA was used as shock troops last year in Turkey’s offensive against US-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria.
In theory, a cease-fire brokered by Russia and Turkey remains in place around Tripoli but Libya’s warring sides have traded accusations of violations, and the shaky truce is threatened by clashes. Representatives from Sarraj and Hifter began meetings in Geneva on Tuesday to work toward a more permanent cease-fire.
The Observatory also quoted a Syrian fighter from Idlib province who applied to go to Libya as saying he was motivated by the financial benefits offered by Turkey.
Elizabeth Tsurkov, a fellow at the US-based Foreign Policy Research Institute who closely follows Syria’s armed groups, said the promise of payment, Turkish citizenship or the prospect of fleeing to Europe were the main motives of Syrian fighters sent to Libya.
“None of them are committed to the fight in Libya due to personal conviction or ideology,” she said.
A Libyan official at the prime minister’s office said Syrian fighters have been in Libya since early August. At first, he said they were only facilitating the work of Turkish military experts. But as the  fighting escalated in mid-December, the number of Syrian fighters arriving in Libya increased. These fighters now immediately deploy to the front lines, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to talk to reporters on the subject.
The Tripoli authorities and US officials have also accused Hifter of relying on hundreds of Russian mercenaries. Sudanese armed groups from the Darfur region recently joined the fighting on both sides, according to a report by UN experts.
The influx of Syrian, Russian and Sudanese mercenaries has threatened to prolong the war and cripple international efforts to establish a long-term cease-fire. Last month, a summit in Berlin brought together the major international stakeholders in Libya, but with few concrete results.
Nicholas Heras, a Syria expert at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, said Turkey is focusing on Libya to establish a sphere of influence in the Mediterranean.
“However, the Turks do not want to risk significant casualties to their own forces when the Turkish military has built a proxy force of Syrian fighters that can reinforce the Libyan fighters,” he said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/hundreds-evacuate-homes-in-new-zealand-to-escape-flooding/,"WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND: Hundreds of people evacuated their homes and farms Wednesday to escape flooding in southern New Zealand.
Authorities told many residents in the towns of Gore, Mataura and Wyndham they should leave immediately as rivers continued to rise following heavy rainfall.

Several hundred tourists were being evacuated from Milford Sound after getting stuck there earlier this week when flooding and mudslides cut off car access. Many of the tourists were evacuated by helicopter.
The Grenfell family was rescued after spending a terrifying night stuck in a hut along a popular hiking track. They told New Zealand broadcaster Newshub that they set up tables to climb above the water and onto the top bunks.
“We were worried that the whole hut would actually start moving because it was creaking and the water was pushing against the walls of the hut,” Tui Grenfell told Newshub. “So we did actually bash holes in the walls of the hut to allow the flow through the hut late last night.”
A helicopter finally arrived in the morning to rescue them.
Authorities have declared a state of emergency in the Southland region.
Weather conditions were improving Wednesday. Some rainfall is forecast over the coming days, but not the heavy rain that has caused the flooding.

DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: Dubai International Airport said on Wednesday that it maintained its title as the world’s busiest for international travel, despite closing one of its runways for repairs last year and the ongoing grounding of the Boeing 737 Max.
The airport, home to long-haul carrier Emirates, saw 86.4 million passengers in 2019, 6 million more than second-place Heathrow Airport in London. That’s down 3% from 2018, which saw 89.1 million passengers at the massive airport.
The airport blamed the weaker numbers in part on a 45-day closure of its southern runway, the bankruptcy of India’s Jet Airways and the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. Government-owned Emirates’ low-cost sister carrier, FlyDubai, had been flying a number of the Maxs in its fleet.
It’s the sixth year for Dubai International Airport to hold the crown as the world’s busiest for international travel. The world’s busiest airport overall is Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/trump-pelosi-feud-erupts-during-speech-to-congress-as-impeachment-trial-nears-end/,"WASHINGTON: A bitter feud between US President Donald Trump and top Democrat Nancy Pelosi boiled over at his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, with Trump denying her a handshake and Pelosi ripping apart a copy of his remarks behind his back.
Trump avoided the subject of his impeachment drama in a pugnacious 80-minute speech, but the raw wounds from the battle were evident with fellow Republicans giving him standing ovations while rival Democrats for the most part remained seated.
The Republican-led Senate was expected to acquit him of charges he abused his powers and obstructed Congress during a vote beginning at 4 pm EST (2100 GMT) on Wednesday.
Seeing Pelosi, the US House of Representatives speaker, for the first time since she stormed out of a White House meeting four months ago, Trump declined to shake her outstretched hand as he gave her a paper copy of his remarks before starting to speak.

Despite having not spoken to Trump since their last meeting, Pelosi appeared to be taken aback. She avoided citing the customary “high privilege and distinct honour” that usually accompanies the speaker’s introduction of the president to Congress.
“Members of Congress, the President of the United States” was all she said in introducing Trump.
When his speech ended, Pelosi stood and tore up her copy of the remarks he had handed her, later telling reporters it was “the courteous thing to do, considering the alternative.”
Kayleigh McEnany, Trump‘s campaign spokeswoman, said of Pelosi: “Her hatred for @realdonaldtrump has blinded her to the repulsive nature of her smug, elitist behaviour.”
After the event, Pelosi tweeted a photo of her with her hand reaching out to Trump and said, “Democrats will never stop extending the hand of friendship to get the job done #ForThePeople. We will work to find common ground where we can, but will stand our ground where we cannot. #SOTU”
The tension was a sign that little legislative progress should be expected with the presidential election nine months away.
The impeachment case has intensified bitter feelings between Trump, a former reality TV star-turned conservative politician, and Pelosi, a California liberal, that have existed throughout his presidency. He routinely calls her “Crazy Nancy” at his campaign rallies.
‘FOUR MORE YEARS’
As he began the speech, Republicans from both houses of Congress chanted “four more years” while he stood at the lectern in the chamber of the House.
Democrats sat silently and some could be seen shaking their heads as Trump declared, “The state of our union is stronger than ever before.”
Pelosi, who dropped her opposition to impeachment and allowed Democratic lawmakers to seek the charges against him, sat stoically and grim-faced behind Trump and paged through a paper copy of his speech as he spoke.
Trump entered the chamber with Democrats experiencing unease and chaos after technical glitches delayed the results of voting in Iowa on Monday, the first 2020 contest as the party seeks a nominee to face the incumbent Republican.
Trump presented himself as a big improvement over Democratic President Barack Obama, whom he succeeded three years ago, saying he had bolstered US economic growth and increased jobs.
“In just three short years we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsising of America’s destiny,” he said.
The House impeachment managers, acting as prosecutors in the Senate impeachment trial, were seated together at the front of the Democrats’ section.
DEMOCRATIC WOMEN PROTEST
Many House Democratic women wore white for a second year in a row, a sign of the suffrage movement that won women the right to vote 100 years ago. Several Democratic lawmakers refused to attend the annual speech to protest Trump, such as liberal firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Trump, using the speech to lay out his vision for a second four-year term, said a Democratic plan to expand government-funded health insurance amounted to a “socialist takeover” that would bankrupt the country, cut benefits for those who have them now and provide care to illegal immigrants.
Democratic presidential candidates and many lawmakers have proposed healthcare plans that would be run by the government, a sharp departure from the current, private system in which millions of Americans receive medical insurance from their employers.
Trump‘s lack of a healthcare plan has left him open to criticism that he has not put enough work into finding a way to reduce rising insurance costs that burden middle-class Americans.
“We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!” Trump said.
Democratic women stood and chanted “HR 3” – a reference to a Democratic bill that would lower drug costs.
In the televised Democratic response to Trump‘s speech, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said: “Democrats are trying to make your healthcare better. Republicans in Washington are trying to take it away.”
Trump offered an upbeat portrayal of his presidency in hopes of persuading Americans to give him another four-year term in the Nov 3 election.
He saluted surprise guest Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader, and made cancer-stricken conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh an immediate recipient of the presidential Medal of Freedom, with Trump‘s wife Melania pinning the ribbon around Limbaugh’s neck.
Trump also revived his polarising arguments that migrants should be stopped from crossing the southern US border and that so-called “sanctuary cities” where migrants are protected are wrong. His immigration policies are opposed by Democrats.
Pelosi could be seen shaking her head as Trump spoke of his views on immigration.
After coming close to a broad conflict with Iran after he ordered the killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, Trump said, “We are working to end America’s wars in the Middle East.”

Paid paternity leave will be extended to nearly seven months, in line with maternity leave. Around half can be given to the other parent.

Pregnant women are also entitled to a month of pregnancy leave before the expected date of birth.
Minister of Health and Social Affairs Aino-Kaisa Pekonen said the aim of the “radical reform” was both to improve gender equality and to boost a declining birth rate.
“This enables better equality between parents and diversity among families,” she said. She noted that other countries such as Sweden and Iceland had seen increases in their birth rates after offering more leave for fathers.
Finland’s governing coalition is made up of five parties, all led by women, of whom four are under 35 years old. Increasing gender equality has been one of the government’s aims since it took office in December.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/unknowns-of-the-new-virus-make-global-quarantines-a-struggle/,"SEOUL: Health authorities are scrambling to halt the spread of a new virus that has killed hundreds in China. But with important details about the illness and how it spreads still unknown, officials and medical personnel are struggling.
Governments have rushed to get their citizens out of China while also restricting visitors from the country, which is orchestrating history’s largest anti-viral campaign by blocking 50 million people from leaving Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, and nearby areas. A growing number of Chinese cities are discouraging people from even leaving their apartments. Villages have blocked entry points with piles of dirt and rubble, while businesses and offices remain closed indefinitely.
As Beijing’s authoritarian leadership faces questions over having kept its citizens in the dark for weeks before infections started to explode, other countries are trying to set up effective quarantines to stop a possible pandemic.
Those efforts have not always been smooth, with violent protests near quarantine centers, banishment to remote islands, the confinement of thousands on a cruise ship, and some citizens allowed to leave quarantine early.
A look at the world’s sometimes-wobbly efforts to stop the crisis:
___
SOUTH KOREA
South Korea has confirmed 18 cases of infection with the new type of coronavirus and there are fears of a broader local spread.
The country has banned entry to all foreigners who have traveled to China’s Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, after Jan. 21. The government says it will consider stopping South Korean tourist visits to China if the outbreak worsens.
Officials have acknowledged missteps in monitoring visitors from China and in tracing the contacts of those infected.
Anxiety abounds. Movie theaters, shopping malls and restaurants have closed. A large church in Seoul skipped Sunday services because a virus patient had attended earlier. Parents have kept schoolchildren at home. Stores are running out of face masks and hand sanitizers.
Residents of central South Korea threw eggs and other objects at government officials over plans to quarantine about 700 evacuees from Wuhan at government facilities in their neighborhoods.
___
AUSTRALIA
Australia has been criticized over its decision to quarantine about 300 Wuhan evacuees on a remote island used in the past to banish asylum seekers and convicts.
Critics say a quarantine center on the Australian mainland would be preferable to Christmas Island. Some inhabitants of the island say the government is turning their home into a “leper colony.”
The government argues that the location strikes a balance between supporting Australians stranded in China and protecting the wider Australian population from the disease.
People on the Australian mainland who might have caught the virus are not placed in quarantine, but are advised to self-isolate for 14 days, which scientists say is the longest incubation period of the virus. The 13 confirmed cases are being treated in hospitals.
Starting this month, Australia has banned foreigners without permanent residency from entering the country if they had visited mainland China in the previous 14 days. China’s national women’s soccer team has been quarantined at a Brisbane hotel since arriving last week.
___
JAPAN
Japan, which has reported 33 cases, stepped up quarantine measures after officials were criticized last week for allowing two evacuees from Wuhan to leave early from a hotel where they had been quarantined.
Officials say 518 evacuees have been placed under a 14-day quarantine at a hotel and three government facilities near Tokyo. Those with symptoms have been treated in isolation rooms at hospitals.
On Tuesday, the government confirmed at least 10 cases on a cruise ship and are quarantining its 3,700 crew and passengers on board.
Starting Saturday, Japan banned the entry of foreigners who have visited Hubei province in the previous 14 days.
Social media is overflowing with comments calling for a ban on all visitors from China.
“I’m afraid Japan will be soon criticized for taking less measures than other countries,” said Mitsunori Okamoto, an opposition lawmaker.

NORTH KOREA
North Korea has yet to report a case, but it’s still pushing a tough campaign to prevent the spread of the virus, which state media have called a matter of “national existence.”
The country has blocked tourists, reduced flights and strengthened screening at borders, harbors and airports. State media say 30,000 health workers have been mobilized across the country for preventive measures.
Rival South Korea last week withdrew dozens of officials from an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong after North Korea insisted on closing it until the epidemic is controlled.
Because fighting the virus is crucial “for defending the security of the country and the life and safety of people, all the workers in the anti-epidemic field set up rapid reaction teams … so as to promptly counter any slightest situation,” Pyongyang’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said.

UNITED STATES
March Air Reserve Base in California’s Riverside County is near capacity after housing 195 people flown in from Wuhan who are now under a federal quarantine.
“We’re pretty much full at this point,” said Maj. Perry Covington, a spokesman at the base.
None of the evacuees at the base has shown signs of the illness.
Tents were set up over the weekend to assist in screening passengers in case other US-bound flights from Wuhan are diverted to the base due to weather or other reasons.

LATIN AMERICA
Mexico says 10 citizens who were flown from China to France on Saturday are in good health. The government hasn’t restricted travel to Wuhan but advises against unessential trips.
Venezuela has started to monitor incoming passengers for symptoms at its largest airport near the capital, Caracas, and plans to expand screening to other airports.
Argentina hasn’t placed restrictions on visitors from China. But two hospitals in Buenos Aires and Ezeiza have been designated for possible isolation and treatment of patients.

EUROPE
Britain has quarantined dozens of people evacuated from China at Arrowe Park Hospital in northwest England. One evacuee has been isolated at a separate hospital for further tests.
“It’s quite weird being home but not being home, and also being sort of locked in, almost like being back in Wuhan really,” Kharn Lambert, a teacher who worked in Wuhan, told Sky News about being isolated at Arrowe Park.
France used two flights to bring back about 400 people from China. They are being quarantined at two different sites in southern France. Italy and Spain have quarantined dozens of evacuees at military facilities.

AFRICA
Quarantine measures are a serious concern in Africa, where health systems on the 54-country continent vary dramatically. John Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there could be undetected infections on the continent.
A plane carrying 167 Moroccan passengers, mostly students, arrived Sunday near Casablanca. They will be quarantined for 20 days in two hospitals in Rabat and Meknes.
In Lagos in Nigeria, authorities asked people arriving from China or other affected countries to practice “unsupervised self-quarantine,” which means staying home, minimizing contact with family members and monitoring for symptoms.
South Sudan, with one of the world’s most fragile health systems following a five-year civil war, recently celebrated the installment of a single thermal scanner at the arrival area of its airport in its capital, Juba.

Death toll in mainland China rises by 65, new daily record
10 cases confirmed on quarantined Japanese cruise ship
American Airlines, United suspend flights to Hong Kong
Virus to delay US export surge from trade deal: White House
Rattled financial markets enjoy some respite

BEIJING: The death toll from a coronavirus outbreak in China passed 490 on Wednesday, as two US airlines suspended flights to Hong Kong following the first fatality there and 10 cases were confirmed on a quarantined Japanese cruise ship.
China‘s National Health Commission said another 65 deaths had been recorded on Tuesday, bringing the toll on the mainland to 490, mostly in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan where the virus emerged late last year.

There have been two deaths outside mainland China. A 39-year-old man in Hong Kong with an underlying illness who had visited Wuhan city, the epicentre of the virus, died on Tuesday. A man died in the Philippines last week after visiting Wuhan, the first virus-related overseas fatality.
Across mainland China, there were 3,887 new confirmed infections, bringing the total accumulated number to 24,324.
Ten people on a cruise liner under quarantine at the Japanese port of Yokohama tested positive for coronavirus, Japan’s health minister said, a figure that could rise as medical screening of thousands of patients and crew continued.
The 10 confirmed cases were among 31 results from 273 people tested so far. There are around 3,700 passengers and crew aboard the Carnival Corp ship.
Another 176 cases have been reported in 24 other countries and regions, according to the World Health Organisation.
ECONOMIC IMPACT SPREADS
As the economic impacts of the virus spread, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the epidemic would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from the Phase 1 trade deal set to take effect later this month, the first time a Trump administration official has said the outbreak would hamper the deal.
“It is true the trade deal, the Phase 1 trade deal, the export boom from that trade deal will take longer because of the Chinese virus,” Kudlow said, adding he did not believe the virus would have a catastrophic effect on business supply chains.
Global markets stabilised on Tuesday after days of selling triggered by fears about China‘s econmic growth, with many factories closed, cities cut off and travel in and out of China severely restricted.
The financial and health impacts of the epidemic were increasingly being felt in Hong Kong, with American Airlines Group and United Airlines suspending flights to and from the Asian financial hub after this week.
Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, which relies heavily on passengers who change flights in the financial centre, said it plans to cut around 30% of its global capacity over the next two months, including around 90% of its flights to mainland China as it grapples with the coronavirus.
Thousands of medical workers in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region of China, held a second day of strikes on Tuesday to press for complete closure of borders with the mainland after three checkpoints were left open.
“We’re not threatening the government, we just want to prevent the outbreak,” said Cheng, 26, a nurse on strike.
Hong Kong has confirmed about 17 cases. It was badly hit by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a coronavirus that emerged from China in 2002, killed almost 800 people worldwide and cost the global economy an estimated $33 billion.
Neighbouring Macau, also a special administrative region of China lying across the Pearl River estuary from Hong Kong, ordered its casinos to suspend operations on Tuesday, effectively closing off the lifeblood of its economy in a drastic measure to contain the epidemic.
Asian stocks steadied on Wednesday on hopes of additional Chinese stimulus to lessen the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.3%. Australian shares were up 0.58%, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index rose 1.19%.
CHINA EVACUATIONS CONTINUE
Beijing has criticised US travel restrictions, barring foreign nationals who have visisted China, as an overreaction and has called on Washington to do more to help China.
US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex said he hoped China would accept an offer from the United States and the WHO to send epidemiological experts to China.
“We have been requesting this since January 6. The World Health Organization sent names over today. We’re hoping the Chinese will act quickly on that,” Azar told Fox Business Network in an interview.
“This is a novel strain. That’s why we’ve got to get on the ground with the world’s best experts and run the studies to get to the bottom of what is the incubation period. We’ve got to confirm what is the risk of asymptomatic transmission,” he said.
The WHO has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency and experts say much is still unknown, including its mortality rate and transmission routes.
Chinese data suggests the new virus, while much more contagious, is significantly less lethal although such numbers can evolve rapidly.
Several countries including Australia and New Zealand continued to evacuate citizens from Wuhan city. The United States said it may stage additional evacuation flights for private U.S. citizens in China‘s virus-hit Wuhan on Thursday.
Wuhan authorities are converting an additional eight buildings, including gymnasiums, exhibition centres and sports centres, into hospitals, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday.
The latest announcement adds to plans revealed earlier this week to convert three other venues in the city into hospitals. Once all 11 buildings are converted, a process that is expected to be completed later on Wednesday, they will be able to accommodate 10,000 patients.
A specially constructed hospital in Wuhan, designed with 1,000 beds, opened to patients on Monday, while the building of a second hospital, with 1,600 beds, is also scheduled to be completed on Wednesday

Man dies in Hong Kong, taking global toll to 427
US upsets China with isolation measures
Thousands screened on quarantined Japanese cruise ship
Thailand has highest infections outside China
Asian governments clamp down on virus misinformation



HONG KONG/BEIJING: Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death on Tuesday, the second outside mainland China from a fast-spreading outbreak that has killed 427 people and threatened the global economy.
China’s markets steadied after Shanghai’s main market lost nearly $400 billion in stock values the previous day, and global markets also recovered from a sell-off last week.
But bad news kept coming.
The Chinese-ruled gambling hub of Macau asked casino operators to close for two weeks to help curb the virus.
And in the latest major corporate hit, Hyundai Motor was to gradually suspend production at South Korean factories because of supply chain disruptions.
Hong Kong’s first fatality was a 39-year-old man with an underlying illness who had visited China’s Wuhan city, the epicentre of the outbreak, hospital staff said.
Chinese authorities, meanwhile, reported a record daily jump in deaths of 64 to 425. The only other death outside mainland China was a man who died in the Philippines last week after visiting Wuhan, the virtually quarantined city at the epicentre of the outbreak.
Total infections in mainland China rose to 20,438, and there have been nearly 200 cases elsewhere across 24 countries and China’s special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau.
Thailand’s tally of infections jumped to 25, the highest outside China, while Singapore’s rose to 24, four of those from local contagion as opposed to visitors from China.
New cases were reported in the United States, including a patient in California infected via someone in the same household who had been infected in China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency and experts say much is still unknown, including its mortality rate and transmission routes.
The outbreak did not constitute a pandemic but an epidemic with “multiple foci”, WHO director of global hazard preparedness Sylvie Briand told a news conference in Geneva.
FOREIGN FEARS
The uncertainties have spurred strong measures by some countries – offending Beijing’s communist government which has called for calm, fact-based responses instead of scaremongering.
The deluge of misinformation on social media – from a recommendation to eat more onions to a warning of spread via a video game – has led Asian governments to hit back with arrests, fines and fake news laws, alarming free speech advocates.
At least 16 people have been arrested over coronavirus posts on social media in Malaysia, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong.
Australia sent hundreds of evacuees from Wuhan to an island in the Indian Ocean, while Japan began screening some 3,700 passengers and crew aboard a cruise liner held in quarantine at the port of Yokohama, after a Hong Kong passenger who sailed on the vessel last month tested positive.
Thousands of medical workers in Hong Kong, which had seen months of anti-China political protests, held a second day of strikes to press for complete closure of borders with the mainland after three checkpoints were left open.
“We’re not threatening the government, we just want to prevent the outbreak,” said Cheng, 26, a nurse on strike.
The Asian financial centre has confirmed 17 cases of the virus.
Hong Kong was badly hit by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that emerged from China in 2002 to kill almost 800 people worldwide and cost the global economy an estimated $33 billion.
Chinese data suggest the new virus, while much more contagious, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.
The WHO’s Briand said most who had died or suffered severe infections were people with underlying conditions such as cancer, diabetes or suppressed immune systems, or the elderly.
US-CHINA FRICTIONS
Raising the prospect of another major spat – just as trade frictions were easing – Beijing on Monday accused the United States of spreading panic after it announced plans to block nearly all recent foreign visitors to China.
A handful of other nations have done the same.
Britain updated its travel advice on Tuesday, telling citizens to leave China if they could.
“Where there are still British nationals in Hubei Province who wish to be evacuated, we will continue to work around the clock to facilitate this,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.
With the world’s second biggest economy facing increasing isolation and disruption, some economists predict world output will shrink by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points.
Many airlines have stopped flights to parts of China, with Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd saying on Tuesday it plans to cut 30% of global capacity over the short term, including 90% to mainland China.
The WHO is having a teleconference this week with travel and tourism representatives to work on recommendations for protecting crews so they can resume flights, Briand said.
“Crews for those companies are really scared of being infected,” she said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/rushing-downstairs-at-end-of-school-14-kenyan-children-killed-in-stampede/,"NAIROBI: Fourteen children were killed in a stampede as they rushed down a staircase at the end of classes at a primary school in western Kenya on Monday, officials said.
At least 39 more pupils were badly hurt in the incident at the Kakamega Primary School, the Daily Nation newspaper said, citing Western Region Police Commander Peris Kimani.
“We lost 14 of them,” Education Minister George Magoha told Citizen TV. “One life (lost) is a life too many.”
The Daily Nation said that some of the children fell from the third floor as they ran.
“As kids were going home from school there was a stampede as they were going down the stairs,” said Peter Abwao, a spokesman for Red Cross Kenya. “It’s a three-storey building, it’s a classroom block.”
Anxious parents waited outside the Kakamega hospital for news of their children, Daily Nation pictures showed.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/companies-feel-impact-of-coronavirus-outbreak-in-china/,"Companies around the world have warned that a coronavirus outbreak in China could disrupt supply chains or hurt bottom lines as factories and shops shut and airlines suspend flights.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
**Apple (AAPL.O) gave a wider-than-usual revenue outlook range for the March quarter to factor in uncertainty. Apple, which has suppliers in Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the heart of the outbreak, said the reopening of some suppliers’ factories outside Wuhan had been moved to Feb. 10 from the end of January.
**Baidu (BIDU.O) postponed the announcement of its fourth-quarter results.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/japan-quarantines-cruise-ship-to-test-3700-on-board-after-hong-kong-coronavirus-case/,"
TOKYO: Japanese officials began screening more than 3,700 passengers and crew on a cruise ship quarantined off the port of Yokohama near Tokyo on Tuesday after a Hong Kong man who sailed on the vessel last month tested positive for coronavirus.
The 80-year-old man flew to Japan and boarded the ship, the Diamond Princess, run by Carnival Japan Inc, in Yokohama on Jan. 20 and disembarked in Hong Kong on Jan. 25, the company said.

Photographs and video posted on Twitter by a passenger with the handle @daxa_tw showed health workers in full-length plastic gowns with white caps and face masks walking down a deserted corridor as well as views of empty lounges and a deserted deck.
Guests were asked to stay in their rooms to await screening. “This could take some time, but it is necessary so we ask for your understanding and cooperation,” an announcement said.
Japan was also preparing to expand the scope of its screening for the virus, and test criteria after initial tests failed to detect the virus in some people who were later found to be infected, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters.
Opposition parties and some experts have criticised the government for responding too slowly to the risks posed by the virus spreading in China and elsewhere.
Chinese make up 30% of all tourists travelling to Japan and nearly 40% of the total amount foreign visitors spent last year, according to an industry survey.
Japan has 20 confirmed coronavirus cases, of these 17 people have been in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the epidemic began.
Japan on Saturday began refusing entry to foreigners who have been in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, in the past 14 days as well as people with passports issued in Hubei province. Suga said that as of Feb. 3, eight foreigners had been barred from entering Japan.
Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor at Japan’s Hokkaido University specializing in computer modelling of infectious diseases, said it would be hard to control the virus’s spread just by isolating cases because of the high rate of asymptomatic transmission.
“The ongoing policy of the Japanese government is to expect containment. Of course, screening or prohibiting entry of people from Wuhan has very limited effectiveness, considering that the epidemic is growing in other cities,” he told a news conference.
Some countries including the United States and Australia have denied entry to all foreign nationals travelling from China.
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said he believed Japan’s current restrictions on entry were appropriate, when asked at a news conference.
Carnival Japan, a unit of British-American cruise operator Carnival Corp, confirmed that the turnaround of the ship had been delayed by about 24 hours for authorities to review the health of all 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew on board.
Once everyone’s health was checked, those with fevers or who felt unwell would be tested, after which authorities would decide whether to let people leave the ship, Suga said.
Asked if the epidemic would affect a visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping expected to take place in April, Suga said preparations for the visit were proceeding as planned. (

Death toll rises to 425 in China
US confirms new case of transmission inside United States
Australian evacuees arrive on remote island
OPEC and others consider output cuts

BEIJING: China said it would welcome assistance from the United States to fight a coronavirus outbreak, a day after it accused Washington of scaremongering, and as the death toll rose on Tuesday by a new daily record to more than 420.
The toll in China rose to 425 as of the end of Monday, up by a record 64 from the previous day, the National Health Commission said on Tuesday. All of the new deaths were in central Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, although experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen including its lethality.
“We expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The total number of infections in China rose by 3,235 on Tuesday to 20,438, and there are at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain.
The CDC confirmed a handful of new cases in the United States, bringing the U.S. total to 11, including a patient in California who was infected through close contact with someone in the same household who had been infected in China.
It marked the second instance of person-to-person spread of the virus in the United States after such a case was announced last week in Illinois.
China accused the United States of whipping up panic over the coronavirus outbreak Chinese stock market plunged about 8% on Monday on the first day back from an extended Lunar New Year holiday.
Beijing made the accusation after the Trump administration on Friday said it was barring nearly all foreign visitors who have been to China within the past 14 days to address the threat of the virus.
A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman on Tuesday said the United States “should adopt an objective, fair, calm and rational attitude” and “refrain from overreacting”.
“China has noted that the United States has repeatedly expressed its willingness to provide assistance to China, and hopes that the relevant assistance will be provided soon,” spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement on the ministry’s website.
With Wuhan and some other cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing; sources at the OPEC oil cartel said producers were considering cutting output by almost a third to support prices.
Airlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China. A suspension by the United Arab Emirates on Monday will affect the Gulf airlines Etihad and Emirates.
The outbreak is reminiscent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a virus from the same family that emerged in China in 2002 and killed almost 800 people around the world out of the 8,000 or so who were infected.
Chinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than SARS, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.
Some economists predict world economic output will be cut by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points due to China’s lockdown.
Countries continued to fly evacuation flights for citizens out of Wuhan. A plane load of Australians left the city on Monday and arrived in the Indian Ocean territory of Christmas Island, where they will be quarantined, media reported on Tuesday.
The United States, which flew people out last week, is planning “a handful more flights” while Russia was due to start evacuating its citizens from Wuhan on Monday.
The White House said China had accepted its offer to have US experts as part of a WHO mission to study and help combat the virus, which emerged from a market in Hubei’s provincial capital of Wuhan late last year.
