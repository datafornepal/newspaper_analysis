http://english.ratopati.com/story/12287,"Kathmandu - As the spread of coronavirus pneumonia has created risks on multiple sectors, the government has come up with some measures to tackle those impacts of COVID-19 on economy and other areas expecting to maintain stability. Against this backdrop, Minister for Finance, who is also the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Dr Yubaraj Khaitwada has talked to Rastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS) about the government measures to combat COVID-19, economic relief packages and other things that the government has pushed forward. &ldquo;First of all the country is in a difficult situation. All the problems that we encounter are not created by ourselves. But, we have to face the problems created by others. All political parties, civil society, industrialists, entrepreneurs and the media should stand in a single point at this difficult hour,&rdquo; Minister Dr Khatiwada told the RSS.

Calling the need for authentic news dissemination, the Communications and Information Minister said the social networking sites users also should give only correct information, adding no one should work to create fear and terror in the society. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to say anything about the responsibility of the press. The media outlets are the main medium for the news dissemination. We expect them responsible and support to the government,&rdquo; Dr Khatiwada shared his expectations from the media. The private media outlets are doing good job and the state-owned media are also expected to carry on news on factual basis without being influenced by any prejudices and limiting their products on the government programmes, he added. Regarding the government decisions, the Finance Minister argued that the decisions were timely and for the control of coronavirus spread. We suspended the international flights and borders.

But, if there were some Nepalis infected (with COVID-19) before the closure of flights and borders, he questioned, adding that the local levels are supposed to take information on the infected persons, if any. The government is sincere towards the supply of basic essential goods so that the citizens won&rsquo;t be victims for lack of those highly essential goods, he said. Minister Dr Khatiwada was of the view that the government&rsquo;s major strategy at this point of time is to ease the supply system without risking the lives of citizens and improving the gaps if any. On the recent decisions of cabinet meeting, the government spokesperson defended the move to impose a ban on the imports of black pepper, dry dates, green peas and liquors arguing that Nepal has already imported those goods that is sufficient for years, not only for a single year. He also said that the bordering areas became the site for illegal trade of those goods which forced the government to impose restrictions on them. He was of the view that the government decision will help save our foreign exchanges and added that import of sophisticated vehicles is also discouraged while calling for investing that amount in capital formation. &ldquo;You media persons should put your analysis on the taken decisions,&rdquo; Dr Khatiwada said.

In a question on appointment of Nepal Rastra Bank&rsquo;s governor, he said the government will decide after the end of the lockdown period. Making it clear about the gravity of some key decisions taken by the Sunday Cabinet meeting to contain the spread and impact of coronavirus, the Finance Minister said the decisions featured some important steps that government had to be taken for the security and protection of vulnerable community such as grassroots people and daily wage earners during the crisis. As he said, daily-wage workers are primarily facing two types of problems: first, their income source has stopped with lockdown and second they have no stock of daily essentials for future. In this context, the mobilisation of local levels has been sought to identify such community and take measures for preventing them from suffering hunger by ensuring their daily minimum food requirement. But, contribution from individual level, social organisations, state level and even from the federation was necessary to set up a fund to manage two square of meals for such community, he stressed. He went on to say that besides the government had realised that expectant mothers, new mothers, aged people, orphans, and persons with disabilities might need special protections and care at this moment, adding the government had made some special provisions for employees with minimum income.

With a growing health risk from coronavirus, a new trend has developed in the society: tenants are being told to leave the house for fear of infection and professionals like doctors, nurses and health workers face fears of being shunned by others and amidst these adversities caused by the crisis, we have called on house owners to show humanity, not to ask tenants to vacate rooms and to waive one month&#39;s rent and hope that they will heartily accept the urge which will be appreciated by the goveremnt. This is for the common good of all Nepali not for the government sole interest, according to the government Spokesperson. &quot;We have some issues related to health services ahead. Tax discount has been ensured in the import of medical equipment,&quot; he said, informing that the deadline for clearing the principle of debt and interest had been extended to till mid-July, the rate of refinance had been reduced and ceiling of a renewed loan had been increased to Rs 60 billion.

He further said 25 percent discount had been given in the electricity tariff in the consumption of up to 150 units in view of the possible shortage of cooking gas in this time of difficulty. &#39;&#39;On one hand, available electricity has not been fully used and on the other hand, the government is giving subsidy in cooking gas cylinders which causes the government Rs 290 loss in each cylinder. It has been realised that it would be better to promote the use of electricity to reduce the use of cooking gas. As a result, power consumption has increased.&#39;&#39; Besides, customs duty has been exempted in the import of induction stove. At this hour, we urge every Nepali household to use induction stove and increase power consumption. We have plentiful electricity for the domestic consumption. The government has promised 30-50 percent discount on electricity tariff for big industries for off-time production so as to utilise power going waste during nighttime, according to him. On a query how the government would assure public regarding implementation of such crucial decisions, he said the ward office would be mobilized as a centre in identifying the needy and distributing reliefs while local level would act a coordinating role and state government would provide support. &quot;We have made the local mechanism responsible in the people&#39;s representative system. Mobilizing the mechanism would also stem the chance for misuse of relief&quot;, he said. Wards possessing higher number of population can mobilize volunteers and humanitarian organizations such as Red Cross and Scout, he said, adding the targeted beneficiaries could be provided with the services by mobilizing volunteers.

&quot;Resource would be mobilized in a collective manner for that and it would be managed from federal reserve in case of inadequacy&quot;, he said, adding Nepal Rastra Bank ahs already made decision in regard to the banking system. He again called for the house owners, schools and health services to waiver the rents and fees to who philanthropic gesture in difficult time. On another query on private hospital&#39;s reluctance to comply with government directive, he said the Corona Control Management Committee which was formed on Sunday would monitor the issue. &quot;The private hospital should also provide services; no hospital should remain aloof from this responsibility&quot;, he said the government has started managing health appliances, safety equipments and medicines. &quot;The government would provide subsidy to the hospitals through the budget, policy and programme but their support is a precondition for this to happen&quot;. Regarding extension of lockdown period, the minister said the government has decided to close the international border entry points (surface and air) up to April 7 (12.00 in the night) and keep the lockdown period up to the same time.

On a query regarding potential impacts of coroanvirus in Nepali economy, Dr Khatiwada said it is early to project the loss it has caused to the economy. &quot;Most of our development works take place from mid-February to mid-May. It seems the opportunity is almost missed. Likewise the month of February and March is the season for tourists&#39; arrival which is also doomed. The outflow to foreign countries for employment has also come to an end&quot;. This of course would limit our economic growth but we are assessing the effects of COVID-9 in our economy, he added. &quot;If we see other countries in the world the pandemic is estimated to cause drop of economic growth by 1 to 2 percent&quot;, he said. He stated that saying six percent growth rate therefore comes to five or 4.5 per cent growth and it would make up to two per cent loss in this current fiscal year if the risk of coronavirus prolongs. Finance minister Khatiwada said the path of prosperity is not the matter of calculating by months, days and years, it is the matter of decades, adding that the country could gain momentum again. He added that the means and resources and capacity should be kept intact.

Responding to the query about preparation of budget for next fiscal year, the Finance Minister said that preparation about the budget was underway and it would be unveiled in the statutory date of Jestha 15 ((May 28) even if corona or other any problems surface. He said, &ldquo;We have been working in difficult situation in order to bring budget. Discussion is underway to give basic ceiling of budget to every ministry. Talks are being held on main programmes. Discussion on budget with National Planning Commission and ministries has been postponed. But ministries have made their own preparations.&rdquo; He further said that there would be impact on remittance as well as two or three other sectors and there is no situation to remit money from abroad. Saying those who are abroad could not send money few months even if they return to work once coronavirus infection comes under control, minister Khatiwada said they have expected only Rs 800 billion as remittance. The Finance Minister shared information that the Ministry has been managing inflation by bringing liberal monetary policy. Extending gratitude towards those who supported the government during this hour, he said businessperson should be accountable. All should do ethical business, said Minister Khatiwada.

Ethical business means business with some norms and values. Likewise, he said that the people should voluntarily abide by the government steps that are aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19. Dr Khatiwada also called for self-discipline since this order was proposed to safeguard the lives of the citizens. &ldquo;This is the government directive for self obedience. This is for our own security,&rdquo; he said, adding it was for preventing the possible outbreak of coronavirus.&nbsp;",-,-

Involuntarily, week by week Nepal&rsquo;s population, joined by the global community, will find itself compelled to abandon hitherto starry-eyed views of &lsquo;America&rsquo; as redeemer, source of truths, and all things good. (It&rsquo;s already happening.)

&nbsp;Working in your country for over four decades, I&rsquo;ve never met people more enthralled with the U.S. as you are. Everyone I know strives to send children here. You order your iphone direct from U.S.A.; you quote the NY Times and CNN; villagers too consult Facebook for &lsquo;reliable&rsquo; news; Kathmandu residents patronize your local reproduction of Starbucks and Pizza Hut. (The only exception to these addictions is Hindi dramas; they&rsquo;re accessed from India.)

On its side, America too is charmed by Nepal. We admire your beguiling, robed monks, your extravagant and vibrant Hindu rituals, and docile residents welcoming us on treks through your Himalaya. 

Appreciating the value of your exceptional loyalty (perhaps based on historical Gurkha-Britishalliances) the U.S. extends an open door to Nepalis: with your abiding charm, your industrious&nbsp; graduates and Buddhist gurus, and your 6,000 earthquake victims, (admitted on TPS-visas in 2015, regardless of their largely fraudulent claims, then granted extensions last year).&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Politically, Nepalis are inexplicably complacent at home. For most of your history you were subjected to the rule of absolute monarchs. Although never occupied by foreign invaders. Following your successful 10-year Maoist guerilla campaign, you eventually rid yourselves of that oppressive sacred kingship. That was followed by your declaration as a republic, multi-party involvement, a democratic constitution and a 2015 election&nbsp; that endowed the winning Marxist/Leninist Party with power. Few lives had been lost in that process and expectations were high moving ahead. Despite the ended monarchy, an expanded free press, a vibrant tourism industry and the injection of foreign aid, your nation&rsquo;s economy was never reformed, your class disparities never addressed. The elite remained entrenched; favoritism, corruption, graft, and nepotism deepened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corruption is worse today than ever. Although officially secular, consumptive spending on temples and rituals has increased, and high caste privilege remains. Your economy is crippled: as new plutocrats sap the wealth, your administration grows fat on bribes while allowing ordinary families to depend on overseas remittances; (5-7 million jobless, a fifth of your 28 million, are migrant workers in Malaysia and Arab Gulf states).&nbsp; 

The U.S.&rsquo;s open door combined with the generosity of foreign social service organizations lodged in Nepal, maintains this status quo.&nbsp; 


It was to be expected that you and your government would await the arrival of foreign medics and health supplies along with instructions from here about how to treat your COVID-19 victims. Instead, growing awareness of that plague arrived with waves of those sons and brothers sent home from their curtailed employment overseas. 


It was to be expected that you and your government would await the arrival of foreign medics and health supplies along with instructions from here about how to treat your COVID-19 victims. Instead, growing awareness of that plague arrived with waves of those sons and brothers sent home from their curtailed employment overseas. (This influx may reverse the drop in agri-production after farms were abandoned or mortgaged, resulting in cash-dependency, more reliance on imported food and other needs, more demand for iNGO assistance.) 

Meanwhile, by March 15th Nepal reported only a single case of infection&mdash;a figure no Nepali accepted.

Your government (neither as impoverished nor indebted as outsiders suppose) is unabashedly corrupt and inattentive; so you&rsquo;re unsurprised at its negligence in identifying infections and moving to protect you from the spreading scourge. 


According to those of you I speak to on a weekly basis, the Nepali leadership was as slack as America in quarantining your population. You bide the time, accustomed to mismanagement and lies waiting for America&rsquo;s magic pill to arrive.


According to those of you I speak to on a weekly basis, the Nepali leadership was as slack as America in quarantining your population. You bide the time, accustomed to mismanagement and lies waiting for America&rsquo;s magic pill to arrive. (By March 28th, only 4 positive cases had been announced, again causing public skepticism.) Now on lockdown&mdash;imposed on the heels of U.S. orders for its citizens -- you can&rsquo;t even take your demands to the streets, a strategy used so effectively against your monarchy. 

While the American leadership has finally awakened to the severity of the pandemic, now rushing to contain the damage; it can draw on abundant resources, however belatedly. Nepal is slowly rousing itself, but it lacks those resources. 

In our phone conversations, it seems you feel forsaken, not by your government but by the U.S. and elsewhere. You must be shaken by witnessing the depravity of your hero. 

As you see, every government is occupied with its own overwhelmed health systems. 

If anyone comes to your rescue I expect it will be China, your northern neighbor and a steadfast benefactor. Beijing&rsquo;s earthquake aid in 2015 was immediate, efficient and unmatched. (China has had major infrastructure projects underway there&mdash;partly to balance your traditional reliance on India.) Just yesterday, responding to today&rsquo;s crisis, Chinese help is on its way to Kathmandu. Your government&rsquo;s incompetence will be ameliorated, for the present.


In the long run, your romanticized image of the omnipotent richest-country-in-the-world, will dissolve. You&rsquo;re not the alone. The world had already glimpsed the unmasked face of the global bully in the person currently occupying the White House. 


In the long run, your romanticized image of the omnipotent richest-country-in-the-world, will dissolve. You&rsquo;re not the alone. The world had already glimpsed the unmasked face of the global bully in the person currently occupying the White House. Now your view is further refined by the U.S.&rsquo; presumption of immunity, our sloppy response to the epidemic, our ill-equipped medical system, the impotence of our military might. 

It&rsquo;s time for Nepal to consider a new policy, not one that transfers over-dependence to China, but one of resourcefulness and self-sufficiency, perhaps on the model of Cuba or Vietnam. A logical step for a Marxist-led government, don&rsquo;t you think?

It may be noted that the government procured Coronavirus testing kits and personal protection equipment from China. Talking to Rastriya Samachar Samiti at the ministry on Monday, the minister said the shipments took place after announcing the bidding in a competitive way and going through the due process. He pledged to commit to his profession and not to misuse money until he is at the helm of political position. &quot;Purchasing such equipment maybe a bit costly at the time of crisis.

http://english.ratopati.com/story/12274,"It is important to discuss how the rapidly changing circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 crisis require doctors to be flexible in order to protect both their patients and the healthcare providers themselves.

Further discussion about importance of understanding the capacity of ICU beds, respirators, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), particularly the N95 mask should be done.Urologists should follow the recommendations of Government of Nepal, Centers of Disease Control (CDC) and American Urological Association(AUA) to stop performing elective procedures, but that in cases of metastasizing cancers doctors need to weigh the need for the surgery against the possibility of contracting COVID-19 while the patient is in recovery in the ICU.

We have learned important lessons from other countries. Some of them have proved themselves good to stop the further spread of the disease; some of them have been defeated in terms of controlling this disease &nbsp;just because they did not take the consequences seriously in the beginning.&nbsp;

It is important to understand the disease. As soon as we have an idea of fever, cough and shortness of breath, primary symptoms of COVID 19 which may last for 14 days after the exposure; it is important to understand how to protect ourselves. All we need to seek for the arrangement of N-95 mask and PPE. We should know exactly what sizes which may fit exactly to our face and body. We should strictly follow the updated guideline available readily in the different websites.

Urological Issues during COVID-19 in Nepal
There is ongoing lockdown countrywide. Almost all the hospitals in Nepal are limited with the provision of semi-services. Doctors and other co-health workers are accepting the lockdown discipline of the government. Rescheduling of the elective cases has been done everywhere. In spite of everything, we have similar issues almost everywhere in the countries regarding our urological patients. Every one of us might be facing the similar problems. All I have done is writing about those issues in a piece of paper. We are responsible for dealing these types of patients;

1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Routine Out patients: We request them to stay at their home and kindly wait for settlement of everything.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Elective Urological Surgeries: We have postponed them until reschedule. We admitted risk reducing strategiesfor already planned few cases.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urological Inpatients: We have discharged our almost all inpatients from the hospital except some needy. We are regularly going to the hospital for the daily rounds.&nbsp;

4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urgent and semi-urgent urological issues: We are attending 24 hours phone call of such cases and entertaining them with possible tele advice and needful medications. If necessary we are asking them to get admitted at nearby health centers and proceed for the needful interventions.&nbsp;

5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urological Cancers: We performed few urological cancer surgery on semi- emergency basis. Our routine follow up of cancer patients have been rescheduled. Those patients under ongoing chemotherapy are getting the medications according to their planned schedule.

6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urological Trauma: Since there is lockdown everywhere, We have not received any call of emergency urological trauma case.&nbsp;

What do urologists need to do for managing the urgent urological cases?

Telemedicine Practice
We can discuss telemedicine strategies for urology practices to help them cope with the COVID-19 crisis. Telemedicine has been recommended by the CDC as part of the COVID-19 response, and federal regulations have been relaxed in order to broaden access. There is recommendation of checking with both malpractice insurance as well as the different payers to ensure that telemedicine is covered before incorporating it into practice. There are several platforms that doctors can quickly integrate into their practice and explains how they work. One can easily imagine how easy they are to use for the patients and for the doctors, as well as some essential differences, specific requirements, and limitations of the telemedicine platforms.

It is highly recommended that the benefits of being a member of a physician community where doctors can support each other and discuss how to get through these difficult times. It is important for Nepalese urologists to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted telemedicine in urology from the examinations and recommendation of CDC. Recent need to keep as many patients out of the office as possible has accelerated the uptake of telemedicine in many practices and led to insurance companies relaxing regulations on its use.

It is importantfor older patients, including assigning a telemedicine manager of choosing a good platform and overcoming technical challenges. CDC further outlines the different types of telehealth consultations, from a quick check-in to a full visit, as well as requirements for visit time and audio-visual connections and concludes the article with information about billing and coding telehealth visits and how urologists can be properly reimbursed. Documentation of every attended call should be done.
Managing Emergency Surgery

CDC &amp; AUA have provided some guidance about managing the emergency cases. We should always think about preserving the resources and capacity of hospital in this difficult lockdown. All the elective cases must be postponed for reschedule. Risk reducing strategies should be applied in them with planned surgery like Ureteral stenting for some needy cases. Many of us might be getting calls for the DJ stent removal from the patients whom we have already stented for many purposes. We can deal the patients over phone call and can categorize the patient accordingly. For those emergency urological including emergency cancer surgeries, patient must be informed well about the possibilities of prolong hospital stays, ICU shift, chance of COVID-19 infection during hospital stay. This is very difficult aspect of the current situation and medical challenges. They may consequence difficult conditions. Other health staffs should be educated about COVID-19 and how to protect themselves. They should be well informed about the screening, prevention and protection from COVID-19.

Managing Urological Cancer Patients&nbsp;
People with cancer appear to be at increased risk of COVID-19, and their outcomes are worse than individuals without cancer. The NCCN Member Institutions are rapidly gaining experience in preventing and managing COVID-19. They are sharing their experience in organizing and managing institutional and care systems responses and best practices in this rapidly evolving global effort. Most cancer treatments will go ahead as normal during few week lockdown.

Routine chemotherapy will go ahead, while some other treatments may change, or be deferred, depending on each individual patient. Appointment of routine non-urgent consultation and non-urgent follow up of cancer patients can be delayed. We must be especially diligent about screening for symptoms and exposure, and we must recognize that our older patients with cancer may be especially vulnerable.

Patients with cancer who are in active treatment are immunosuppressed and are more susceptible to infection and to complications from infection, while we don&#39;t yet have much data on how COVID-19 impacts patients with cancer, we can simply suspect that patients undergoing active cancer treatment may be especially vulnerable to the more severe illness associated with COVID-19.

Those in active treatment are screened by telephone 24 to 48 hours before arrival, after which they undergo a full risk assessment in an isolation room. Those with a respiratory infection are given a mask. Each of those patients must be treated as they are positive case.

Needy patients are also advised to follow some informative blogs and websites like Centers of Disease Control (CDC) and American Urological Association (AUA). They will be benefitted well.&nbsp;

After all everything is going in a good way even during this stressful crisis. Things might be the reflection of automatic adjustment. Things are getting adjusted itself. Nepal Association of Urological Surgeons (NAUS) should publish a circular about the issues of managing such urological cases. Countrywide, the number of urologists might be enough to manage this difficult situation. All everyone might be looking for formal guidance from our national society.&nbsp;

Facing this critical situation, health care workers on the front line who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. The ever-increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases, overwhelming workload, depletion of personal protection equipment, widespread media coverage, lack of specific drugs, and feelings of being inadequately supported may all contribute to the mental burden of these health care workers.

Those health care workers feared contagion and infection of their family, friends, and colleagues, felt uncertainty and stigmatization. Experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, which could have long-term psychological implications. Similar concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising.

Psychological assistance services, including telephone-, internet-, and application-based counseling or intervention, has&nbsp; widely developed in &nbsp;local and national mental health institutions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

&nbsp;Mental health problems among health care workers treating patients with COVID-19 by &nbsp;the magnitude of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress and by analyse the potential risk factors associated with these symptoms.

The Role of Psychiatric Nurse During the Coronavirus Outbreak

Emerging infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, cause significant fear and uncertainty. Psychiatric nurse can play an important role in supporting the well-being of patients and families, healthcare personnel, and the general public.

Infectious disease outbreaks produce a range of psychological and behavioral effects. Inform patients about common responses, such as insomnia, anxiety, fear of illness, or desire to increase alcohol and tobacco use. Children and adolescents may experience regression, social isolation, or aggressive behaviors, all of which can be misinterpreted as &quot;acting out.&quot; Educate patients on ways to reduce overall stress, such as getting adequate sleep, eating regular meals, exercising, staying connected to friends and family, and relaxation techniques. Inform patients when and where to get help if needed.

Recommend HealthPromoting Behaviors

Recommend patients use trusted sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to obtain the most updated information on keeping their family safe and healthy, which can decrease distress. Encourage patients to develop a family plan for dealing with outbreaks, which reminds people there are steps they can take to care for themselves. Knowing your work and/or school plans for dealing with COVID-19 also helps reassure people about steps being taken by others to safeguard their health. Recommend patients to limit exposure to outbreak-related traditional and social media; increased media exposure is often associated with higher levels of distress.

Preparing your practice


	Promote frequent hand washing ( with soap andwateror 60% + alcohol-based hands rubs)
	Encourage respiratory etiquette (covering cough and sneezes)
	Provide tissues and trashreceptacle
	Discourage sharingof items and equipment( Mobile, pens, desks, etc)
	Maintain regular housekeeping practices, including cleaning and disinfectingsurfaces
	&nbsp;
	Maintain social distanceas much as possible


Support the Health Care System

Most patients with COVID-19 illnessrelated concerns will present in primary and emergency settings. Psychiatric nurse can play an important role in optimizing population mental health by providing interdisciplinary education, consultation, and collaboration to help colleagues more effectively identify outbreak-related distress responses and provide early interventions. Non-infected patients experiencing illness-related distress should have their concerns validated, while also helping them learn ways to more effectively cope. Interventions should serve to enhance feelings of safety, calming, self- and community efficacy, social connectedness, and hope or optimism about the future.

&nbsp;

Facilitate Problem-Solving

Uncertainty about the future is common and best addressed through practical problemsolving. For instance, Psychiatric nurse can help people consider alternative social greetings when handshaking is discouraged, or explore technology-based means of connecting for community activities when social distancing measures recommend avoiding large, group gatherings. Encourage families to involve children in problem-solving, which can decrease feelings of distress for kids. Reminding people there are steps they can take to manage through challenges enhances calming, increases selfefficacy, and reduces feelings of helplessness.

Empower Ill Patients, Their Families, and Care Providers

Psychiatric nurse can empower patients, families, and care provider through education about the psychological effects of isolation and quarantine. Short-term effects may include anxiety, anger, fear of infecting others, and frustration, with those who experience longer periods of isolation being more likely to develop post-traumatic stress symptoms or increase substance use. Ensuring quarantined patients have adequate supplies and that they and their families are given comprehensive, ongoing, updated information reduces distress and uncertainty. The use of technology to connect patients with family, friends and their health care team can decrease feelings of isolation.

Encourage Provider SelfCare

COVID-19 and other infectious disease outbreaks severely stress health systems and the providers working within them. Routine and ongoing self-care helps providers function more effectively at work and home. Sleeping, eating, hydrating, and taking breaks are important during the work-day. Providing support to peers, finding constructive solutions to work challenges, and staying connected with family and friends can lower overall stress.

Rights, roles and responsibilities of health workers, including occupational safety and health

&nbsp;Health workers are at the front line of any outbreak response and as such are exposed to hazards that put them at risk of infection with an outbreak pathogen (in this case COVID-19). Hazards include pathogen exposure, long working hours, psychological distress, fatigue, occupational burnout, stigma, and physical and psychological violence. This document highlights the rights and responsibilities of health workers, including specific measures needed to protect occupational safety and health.

Health worker rights include that employers in health facilities:


	Assume overall responsibility to ensure that all necessary preventive and protective measures are taken to minimize occupational safety and health risks
	
		Provide information, instruction and training on occupational safety and health, including;
	
	



	Refresher training on infection prevention and control (IPC); and
	Use, putting on, taking off and disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE);



	Provide adequate IPC and PPE supplies (masks, gloves, goggles, gowns, hand sanitizer, soap and water, cleaning supplies) in sufficient quantity to healthcare or other staff caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, such that workers do not incur expenses for occupational safety and health requirements.
	Familiarize personnel with technical updates on COVID-19 and provide appropriate tools to assess, triage, test and treat patients and to share infection prevention and control information with patients and the public.
	As needed, provide with appropriate security measures for personal safety.
	Provide a blame-free environment for workers to report on incidents, such as exposures to blood or bodily fluids from the respiratory system or to cases of violence, and to adopt measures for immediate followup, including support to victims.
	Advise workers on self-assessment, symptom reporting and staying home when ill;
	Maintain appropriate working hours with breaks
	Consult with health workers on occupational safety and health aspects of their work and notify the labour inspectorate of cases of occupational diseases
	Not be required to return to a work situation where there is continuing or serious danger to life or health, until the employer has taken any necessary remedial action
	Allow workers to exercise the right to remove themselves from a work situation that they have reasonable justification to believe presents an imminent and serious danger to their life or health. When a health worker exercises this right, they shall be protected from any undue consequences
	Honour the right to compensation, rehabilitation and curative services if infected with COVID-19 following exposure in the workplace. This would be considered occupational exposure and resulting illness would be considered an occupational disease
	Provide access to mental health and counselling resources; and
	Enable co-operation between management and workers and/or their representatives.


Health workers should


	Follow established occupational safety and health procedures, avoid exposing others to health and safety risks and participate in employer-provided occupational safety and health training.
	Use provided protocols to assess, triage and treat patients.
	Treat patients with respect, compassion and dignity.
	Maintain patient confidentiality.
	Swiftly follow established public health reporting procedures of suspect and confirmed cases.

	Put on, use, take off and dispose of personal protective equipment properly;
	Self-monitor for signs of illness and self-isolate or report illness to the concern person, if it occurs.
	Advise management if they are experiencing signs of undue stress or mental health challenges that require support interventions; and report to their immediate supervisor any situation which they have reasonable justification to believe presents an imminent and serious danger to life or health.

He said he has been washing his hands with soap and urging members of his family to do the same to keep safe from the deadly virus. &quot;I had heard that our metropolis was going to manufacture sanitiser and masks, and distribute them to the city people. I went looking for these things in the market, but there is neither mask nor sanitiser. May be it is only for the sake of publicity,&quot; he said. Rakesh Chitrakar, a resident of Lalitpur Metropolitan City -16, also rued that he too has not been able to get hold of neither face mask nor sanitiser whenever he went to the retail store to buy these items.

&quot;I think this talk of the metropolis itself producing and distributing face masks and sanitiser is only the publicity stunt of the metropolis. I have not been able to get these things in the market. The municipality authorities have not felt the difficulty the locals have been facing in such adverse situation,&quot; he said. He added that the children quite often went out of home to play in the courtyard and it would have been easier had sanitiser been made easily available rather than asking the children to wash their hands with soap every time when there is scarcity of water at home.

Now, I feel that that announcement was only a publicity,&quot; she expressed her annoyance.

&quot;We said we are going to manufacture masks and sanitiser but have not been able to bring the raw materials required for this due to the lockdown.

One could see how difficult it was for the security to check and convince the swarm of people entering into Nepal after they were stranded at border. Similarly, as the people took into isolation broke the boundary and fled the scene, security persons faced tough time to handle the situation. At a time when the police persons are working for people&#39;s safety, how safe they are may be equally pressing issue. In this connection, when this reporter reached a police person on duty on Kathmandu road on Friday, he said, &quot;We&#39;re committed to country&#39;s security and safety. Leadership should think on boosting our morale.&quot; He had no gloves in hand.

The police persons on roads could be seen equipped only with common mask and hand sanitizer for their safety. The Armed Police Force too has the same condition. At such, some have voiced for incentives to boost their morale in the crisis. The police persons below the Inspector level seem more vulnerable, some argue. To this, Deputy Superintendent of Police Bishworaj Pokhrel, who is the Chief of Metropolitan Police Office, Kathmandu, however, said the leadership is aware to keep intact the morale of the police persons. &quot;The high level officers of Nepal Police are also mobilized together, which helps boost the morale of junior staffs.&quot; &quot;All police persons have similar experience. It is our duty to work for security. We need to work in high spirit,&quot; said another police officer.

Moreover, Deputy Superintendent of the Armed Police, Prabin Kumar Shrestha, said teams of armed police were mobilized as per the direction from government and district security committee. Police are in most vulnerable condition, so the security teams are mobilized consisting of few members. Mostly, vehicles are used, and information collection is made more active in view of the vulnerability. He argued that the motivational incentives was essential to motivate the police at such risky situations. It is stated that the security agency has urged the government to manage such allowance following the international practice. Meanwhile, some public are willing to come in the street for fun, the security force has the compulsion in such cases.

Generally, it is quite challenging to repair leaky pipes in the busy roads. So, during lockdown, the leakage problem has been fixed at 100 locations, the KUKL said. The KUKL said it has been getting required cooperation and coordination from the Department of Roads and traffic police to repair the leaking pipes.

Precautionary measures have been taken in repairing works, said KUKL CEO Milan Kumar Shakya. Leakage fixing works have been already completed in Gaushala Chowk, Baneshwor and Battisputali areas and the works will begin at Koteshwor Chowk within the next few days. It is said generally, 40 percent drinking water goes to waste due to leakage in the Kathmandu Valley which usually faces a water shortage.

The durability of water pipes also matters in the leakage problems. According to CEO Shakya, GI pipes have been used in most locations and these pipes are less durable. But we have to supply waters from these pipes at least for a year and the leakage problem is likely frequent until such pipes are replaced by high quality pipes.

Our economic growth rate had been increasing by double digit and the government had doubled the budget to the labour sector in the second year compared to the first year,&quot; the PM noted.

Calling upon all sides to move ahead together like the trade unions in the present difficult time by correcting any shortcomings and by becoming disciplined, PM through the message also urged for sincerity in our efforts and taking account of the time we have in hand.",-,-

http://english.ratopati.com/story/12781,"Kathmandu - Buses after buses are being send from here to bring home people stranded in Kathmandu after the extension of the lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. However, no decision has been made so far to bring home the Nepalis stranded in various border towns in India due to the same for long.

It is said the Federal Parliament lawmakers, former ministers and student organisation leaders from Kanchanpur, Kailali and other districts of the Sudur Paschim state, who are based in the central capital, Kathmandu, are arranging for sending the people in the central capital home. They have been sending out messages through social media collecting names of people who wanted to be rescued and go home after the extension of the lockdown.

Looking at the messages related to this doing round in the social media, it gives the glimpse of canvassing during election time. Although the MPs, politicians and student leaders from the State and based in the central capital are more than eager in the task of rescuing the lockdown-stranded people in Kathmandu to their homes, they are not as enthusiastic in rescuing the hundreds of Nepalis stranded in the Indian towns across the border who have now spend more than a month at quarantines in schools and other public buildings there.

Not even the State government, the local governments and the district administrations have made earnest efforts for rescuing the Nepalis stranded in border towns of India. Most of these people are migrant workers from Nepal. The local administration in Kanchanpur district has notified the local levels in the district to keep people coming in the district from other places in quarantine for 14 days.

But this notification is not effectively implemented giving rise to concern of spread of coronavirus infection. &quot;Although arrangements have been made for keeping in quarantine the people entering the district from India, nobody seems to be serious regarding bringing the Nepali citizens home,&quot; a chief officer of security body here said.

The official said no people&#39;s representative has spoken of bringing home the stranded Nepali workers in India. It may be recalled here that the Supreme Court has also ordered the government to bring home the Nepalis kept in quarantine at the Indian border towns, and if not to make arrangements for providing them food and accommodation there.

Meanwhile, the Chief District Officer of Kanchanpur district has said the district administration has not issued permit to bring people from any place including from Kathmandu. ---",-,-

http://english.ratopati.com/story/12775,"In December 2019, an unknown virus emerged from the Wuhan city of China where infected patients were showing symptoms of pneumonia. The first case was belived to have come from the local seafood wholesale market. By January 1st, the wholesale market was closed as the health experts found 40 new cases. On January 7th, World Health Organization (WHO) officially announced that they had found a new virus and named it as COVID-19.&nbsp;

On January 13, first case was reported outside China in Thailand. On January 23th, the lockdown of Wuhan city was announced by China. &nbsp;However, the virus had already spread globally. The WHO has already announced Covid-19 as global pandemic. More than 2 million have already been infected from which more than one hundred 90 thousand have died from the virus.

The place of the origin of this virus is not yet confirmed. Many countries accuse that the virus was leaked from a lab in Wuhan which China has strongly denied.

When the first cases started emerging in Europe, especially in Italy, people did not take the cases seriously. Many youth believed that the virus didnot have any effect on them. Due to this, the virus rapidly started spreading throughout Europe, US and other parts of the world. Today, countries like the US, Spain, and Italy have the highest number of cases surpassing China from where the virus was frist seen. The total number of death in the US has drastically increased with more than nine hundred thousand cases with more than 51 thousand deaths.

Due to COVID-19, most of the people are in quarantine meaning all the schools, offices, and many factories being closed for more than a month. This has hardly stricken the economy of every country and especially developing countries. Many countries government has passed strict rules for people who are attempting to break the quarantine law and have promised to provide proper care to their citizen.

But most of the South Asian countries have failed to do so. In Nepal, many people, especially the daily wage workers, are out in the streets because they do not have anything to eat and nowhere to go. The lockdown in Nepal was suddenly implemented with most of the people not prepared for it. Now that the lockdown has been implemented for almost a month, people are still in the street. Many of them don&rsquo;t even have basic needs like food and water. The government has failed to help those people. If the virus starts to spread in that group of people, the country will certainly turn into the desert of dead people.

Covid-19 is spreading rapidly in most countries and still no proper vaccine has been created. WHO has requested the entire global citizens to practice social distancing to flatten the curve until the virus comes under control. Many health experts are giving their lives to save the people who are getting infected by the virus. Among these health experts, some has raised awareness to the citizen of the global by showing banners like &ldquo;Stay home because I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; After Covid-19 is over, things are certainly not coming back to normal at once. It may take months to recover the economy. People who have lost their jobs due to the virus have to search for a new one to sustain the economy of their family and their country. The crises that we are facing now will take time to be normal even after Covid-19 pandemic is over.

There are some positive impacts of the virus as well. Due to lockdown, the environment of the world has drastically changed. The emission of carbon gases is low. The statistical report says that pollution is New York has been reduced to 50% compared to last year. Similarly, in China, the emission fell to 25% after factories were shuttered. The emission of greenhouse gases is low after the global lockdown has been implemented. Whether the impact has been positive or negative ever people&#39;s lives have changed due to the virus.

With proper vaccines still not made to tackle the virus, every citizen must be responsible and sensible in time like this. The cases will increase and so will the death. The best we can do is stay home and flatten the curve. Stay Home! Stay safe!

People are now searching for different measure to work and learn during this time. Online classes and exams are being held to complete the course of the current semester.

After the Covid-19 pandemic was announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) many institutions began to shut down for the safety of students, teachers, professors, and other staff. Due to this, the course of students could not be completed and many high school courses have taken different majors to complete their courses. The effect of Coivd-19 has brought higher stress levels to the students. The life of every student had changed as online classes are being held. Maintaining the schedule from home is getting harder for many students and is missing the classes.

The education system has messed and it is still unknown how it is going to recover. The drawbacks of Covid-19 on education are flawless from finance to maintaining the schedule. Many families who are economically struggling in this period cannot afford to help their children in learning progress as everything now has been technological meaning technology is being used to teach a student with the help of online platforms such as zoom and hangout. The economically struggling cannot afford to have the privilege of technology to use such a platform. The schedule cannot be properly maintained as one or the other work pops up when working from home. Even then the connection of the internet plays a huge role in this case. The internet traffic which is obviously may interrupt the learning environment for both teachers and students which leads to concentration difficulties. Delays of many courses will be seen as there is still no proper way to help every student take the course because of their family economic struggle.

While there are many drawbacks to the situation, it, of course, comes with benefits as well. Students will have new opportunities to make themselves even better with the help of thousands of online courses. There are many online resources to learn from khan academy to udemy and skillshare. Due to the situation, a new method of learning will be found to cope with the situation. The education system of the word may also change due to this. The world moving vastly toward the technological era, students can learn programming, designing and other skills to move up with the time. New learning opportunity for students can be seen as they are switching from frontal classes to only classes which make the classes more interesting and exciting.

The government further said the unilateral act runs against the understanding reached between the two countries including at the level of Prime Ministers that a solution to boundary issues would be sought through negotiation. Nepal remains committed to seek diplomatic solution to boundary issues on the basis of the historical treaty, documents, facts and maps in keeping with the spirit of close and friendly ties between the two countries, the government added.

The government also called upon the Indian government to refrain from carrying out any activity inside the territory of Nepal. &quot;It may be recalled that the Government of Nepal had expressed its disagreement in 2015 through separate diplomatic notes addressed to the governments of both India and China when the two sides agreed to include Lipu Lekh Pass as a bilateral trade route without Nepal&rsquo;s consent in the Joint Statement issued on 15 May 2015 during the official visit of the Prime Minister of India to China,&quot; government reiterated.

Moreover, it said Nepal reemphasizes that pending boundary issues between the two countries should be resolved through diplomatic means. Nepal has also proposed twice the dates for holding the meeting of the Foreign Secretaries of the two countries, as mandated by their leaders, for which the response from the Indian side is still awaited, according to the Ministry.

It may be noted that the two governments had constituted the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) on Nepal-India Relations with a mandate to recommend measures and institutional framework with a view to elevating the existing relations to a new height.

The Group has concluded its task and prepared a consensus report, the press statement mentioned, adding that Nepal is ready to receive the report and believes that it will be in the interest of the two countries to implement its recommendations which will also help address the outstanding issues left by the history, thereby paving the way for ever stronger neighbourly relations.",-,-

The 80-km link road was inaugurated by Indian government last Friday through videoconferencing. Taking part in today&rsquo;s meeting of the federal parliament&rsquo;s State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, Minister Thapa said that the issues should be addressed through trilateral talks.

&ldquo;The newly inaugurated road is built for trade purpose. The move of Nepal would yield success if Nepal holds trilateral talks and bars the use of Lipu Lekh Pass,&rdquo; Thapa said. Parliamentarians have outlined the need to hold talks with the UK government regarding the territories as Lipu Lekh as they argued that Sugauli Treaty was signed between Nepal and UK in 1816 to which Minister Thapa deemed appropriate.

As per the Sugauli Treaty, all the territories east of Kali (Mahakali) River, including Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipu Lekh, belong to Nepal. The Minister also said that this issue should be broached in the international platform and speed up the diplomatic efforts to resolve this issue. He also pointed out the need to issue Nepal&rsquo;s map that encompasses all the Nepal&rsquo;s territories. He said he would take the matter seriously and take the issue to the decision-making agency.

He viewed that the present generation of Nepalis were bearing the brunt of the thoughtless decisions made by our former rulers. &ldquo;The major blunder regarding the nationality made by our former rulers was allowing the Indian Army to build a post in Nepal&rsquo;s border to safeguard themselves from China&rsquo;s attack,&rdquo; the Minister described, terming it as a serious historic blunder. According to him, Nepal&rsquo;s inability to send back the Indian Army personnel from Kalapani had shown the seed for India&rsquo;s presence and dominance in that area.

He claimed that the India had captured Lipu Lekh, Kalapani not only militarily but also politically. Thapa shared that India has built many infrastructures besides administrative units in Kalapani in Nepal&rsquo;s territories. The Minister shared that India had encroached around 400 square kilometer of Nepal&rsquo;s territory. He also recalled Nepal&rsquo;s objection after the Indian government had issued a political map including Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipu Lekh in its territory last November.

The government of Nepal has already objected the Link Road officially and preparation was made to set up a Border Outpost at Chang, informed the Minister. The parliamentarians had requested Minister Thapa to deploy security personnel in the places where India had constructed the Road. The 14 parliamentarians taking part in the meeting had drawn the attention of government to immediately safeguard Nepal&rsquo;s border.

http://english.ratopati.com/story/12964,"Kathmandu - Minister for Foreign Affairs Pradeep Kumar Gyawali has said nobody will face legal complications in foreign land just because of the termination of their visa term. He was referring to the Nepalis who are in abroad employment and engaged in various professions and businesses. Minister Gyawali shared this information while speaking in the meeting of the Federal Parliament&#39;s Committee on Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation of the Directive Principles, Policies and Obligation of the State on Monday.

He said no problem has been seen anywhere so far regarding the treatment of Nepali nationals abroad who are infected with coronavirus as the countries concerned have been urged to make arrangements for the same level of treatment to Nepalis as was provided their citizens. The Foreign Affairs Minister said the employment companies themselves have made arrangements for food and accommodation for the Nepali workers and in some instances where the employer has run away, the Non-Resident Nepalis Association, local charity organisations and the Nepali embassy concerned are working together to provide the necessary assistance.

However, this does not means that everything is alright in all places. He reiterated that arrangements have been put in place so that no Nepali citizen will have to face problems in foreign land just for the reason of termination of that person&#39;s visa term. The Minister for Foreign Affairs reiterated that the government was conscious of the fact that Nepalis should be able to return their homes and that the number of people losing jobs has been increasing due to the COVID-19. He said the government has estimated that the number of Nepalis returning home from abroad due to the adverse impact of the coronavirus pandemic would be around 588 thousand 700.

This includes about 325,000 people who will be returning home from the Gulf countries and the rest from India. It is said among them, 210 thousand 871 people need to be brought home immediately. &quot;There is challenge regarding determining the priority of those who want to return home and how and where to manage them in quarantine once they are brought home. The government is doing home work in this regard,&quot; the Minister Gyawali said. According to him, 25 thousand of the 35 thousand quarantines set up in the country were occupied.

It is estimated there will be shortage of quarantine facilities if a large number of Nepalis returned home at once. But the government will bring home all the Nepalis, who want to return home by making the adequate arrangements including quarantine. The Minister stated that providing employment to the Nepal-returnees would be another challenge. Fifteen per cent of the total population of the country is outside the country.

As per the information made available by diplomatic missions and bodies, six million 463 thousand 373 Nepalis are involved in various sorts of employment in 109 countries of the world. There are more than 10 thousand Nepalis in 21 various countries. A large number of people abroad is that of workers.

In the zero hour of today&rsquo;s National Assembly meeting, the parliamentarians highlighted the need for the government to resolve the border issues through diplomatic channels and not to spare even an inch while bringing back the encroached territory.

Some lawmakers pledged to donate their salaries for the fencing in the border areas. The 80-km link road was inaugurated by Indian government last Friday through video conferencing. It originates from Ghatiabagarh in India and terminates at Lipu Lekh Pass that lies in Nepal. The government of Nepal has already submitted a diplomatic note to India via Indian Ambassador to Nepal, voicing objection to the encroachment of Nepal&rsquo;s land as well as conveying Nepal government&rsquo;s position on boundary issues.

The parliamentarians further said Indian side had never dealt with Nepal in a friendly manner, often eyed on Nepal&rsquo;s land and troubled Nepal by constructing road illegally and they urged the government to resort to other ways if need be besides political and diplomatic channels to address the issue. Anita Devkota condemned the comment of the government that it was oblivious about the construction of road by Indian side in Lipulek and demanded explanation from the government about its ignorance on the matter. Indu Kadariya voiced to demarcate Nepali border and put fences in the border from east to west as, according to her, India had been repeatedly troubling Nepal and encroaching border again and again.

http://english.ratopati.com/story/12997,"Kathmandu - An additional 2,400 children could die every day from preventable causes over the next six months in South Asia as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to weaken health systems and disrupt routine services across the region, UNICEF said today. The estimate is based on an analysis by researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, newly published in The Lancet Global Health journal. Based on the worst of three scenarios in 118 low- and middle-income countries globally, the analysis estimates that an additional 1.2 million under-five deaths could occur in just six months, due to reductions in routine health service coverage levels and an increase in child wasting.

The researchers estimate that in the next six months up to 300,000 children could die in India alone; 95,000 in Pakistan, 28,000 in Bangladesh, 13,000 in Afghanistan, and 4,000 in Nepal. &ldquo;We fear that the number of children dying before their fifth birthdays is going to increase for the first time in decades,&rdquo; said UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia, Jean Gough. &ldquo;We must protect the mothers, the pregnant women and children in South Asia at all cost. Fighting the pandemic is critical but we cannot lose momentum on the decades of progress we have made in the region to reduce preventable maternal and child deaths.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is crucial that childbirth, child health and nutrition services remain available for families during the time of COVID-19,&rdquo; said UNICEF Regional Health Adviser for South Asia Dr Paul Rutter.

&ldquo;It would be terrible to see a situation in which many thousands of children die, not because of the virus itself but because routine services are disrupted.&rdquo; In countries with already weak health systems, COVID-19 is causing disruptions in medical supply chains and straining financial and human resources. Visits to health care centres are declining due to lockdowns, curfews and transport disruptions, and as communities remain fearful of infection. In a commentary to the Lancet report, UNICEF warns these disruptions could result in potentially devastating increases in maternal and child deaths.

The paper analyzes three scenarios for the impact of reductions in lifesaving interventions due to the crisis on child and maternal deaths globally. It warns that in the least severe scenario, where coverage is reduced around 15 per cent, there would be a 9.8 per cent increase in under-five child deaths, or an estimated 1,400 a day globally, and an 8.3 per cent increase in maternal deaths. In the worst-case scenario, where health interventions are reduced by around 45 per cent, there could be as much as a 44.7 per cent increase in under-five child deaths and 38.6 per cent increase in maternal deaths per month.

These interventions range from family planning, antenatal and postnatal care, child delivery, vaccinations and preventive and curative services. The estimates show that if, for whatever reason, routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased, the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. The greatest number of additional child deaths will be due to an increase in wasting prevalence among children, which includes the potential impact beyond the health system, and reduction in treatment of neonatal sepsis and pneumonia. According to the modeling, and assuming reductions in coverage in the worst-case scenario, the 10 countries that could potentially have the largest number of additional child deaths are: Bangladesh, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania. The 10 countries that are most likely to witness the highest excess child mortality rates under the worst-case scenario are: Djibouti, Eswatini, Lesotho, Liberia, Mali, Malawi, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone and Somalia.

Continued provision of life-saving services is critical in these countries. In addition to the estimated potential rise in under-five and maternal deaths described in the Lancet Global Health Journal analysis, UNICEF is deeply alarmed by the other knock-on effects of the pandemic on children: An estimated 77 per cent of children under the age of 18 worldwide &ndash; 1.80 billion out of 2.35 billion &ndash; were living in one of the 132 countries with stay-at-home policies, as of early May; nearly 1.3 billion students &ndash; over 72 per cent &ndash; are out of school as a result of nationwide school closures in 177 countries; 40 per cent of the world&rsquo;s population are not able to wash their hands with soap and water at home; nearly 370 million children across 143 countries who normally rely on school meals for a reliable source of daily nutrition must now look to other sources as schools are shuttered; and as of 14 April, over 117 million children in 37 countries may miss out on their measles vaccination as the pandemic causes immunization campaigns to stop to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

This week, UNICEF is launching #Reimagine, a global campaign to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from becoming a lasting crisis for children, especially the most vulnerable children &ndash; such as those affected by poverty, exclusion or family violence. Through the campaign, UNICEF is issuing an urgent appeal to governments, the public, donors and the private sector to join UNICEF as it sought to respond, recover and reimagine a world currently besieged by the coronavirus.",-,-

http://english.ratopati.com/story/13875,"Kathmandu - A tense military standoff between China and India over a disputed border area in the Himalayas has put much of the region on edge. Not least in Nepal, which has its own ongoing land dispute with India and where concern is mounting that the India-China power play could damage its territorial integrity.

On June 15, after weeks of escalating tensions, violent clashes broke out between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the border in the Galwan Valley of the Ladakh region, claimed by both India and China. Dozens of Indian soldiers were reportedly killed. India and China have been steadily increasing the number of their troops on either side of the line of actual control, which has separated Chinese Tibet from Indian Ladakh since the 1962 Sino-Indian war.

Since that same conflict, India has systematically stationed military troops in the Kalapani area further to the west where the borders of Nepal, China and India meet. But Nepal argues that the Kalapani region lies within its territory. Amid the latest tensions between India and China, Nepal is furious that its own border dispute with India could be sidelined. Route through the mountains The 335 sq km area between the areas of Limpiyadhura and Kalapani and the Lipulekh pass &ndash; collectively referred as Kalapani region &ndash; holds strategic significance because of its geography.

The Lipulekh pass &ndash; which Nepal claims as part of its own territory &ndash; is the shortest land route from India to China and already an important trade route. To consolidate its claim over the Kalapani region, in November 2019 the Indian government unilaterally published a new map that included the region within Indian territory.

This was followed in May by the inauguration of a new 75km road linking Dharchula in India via the Lipulekh pass to the Kailash-Mansarover area in the Tibetan plateau in China. The road also joins the Mansarover lake to the base of Mount Kailash, an important site for both Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims.

There were widespread public protests in Nepal at India&rsquo;s actions. In retaliation, Nepal unveiled its own new map in late May which included the Kalapani region as part of Nepal which was approved by Nepal&rsquo;s parliament and the president in late June. Nepal&rsquo;s prime minister, Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, said he was not bothered if the map angered anyone and that &ldquo;we will reclaim that land at any cost&rdquo;.

Source of the Mahakali river Nepal&rsquo;s claim to the region and the Lipulekh pass stems from the 1816 Treaty of Sugauli it entered with the British colonial rulers that defined its western border with India at the end of a two-year long war. After Partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947, both India and Nepal subsequently accepted the Mahakali river as the defining boundary of the west of Nepal. However, the issue has been complicated by disputed historical maps relating to the origin of the Mahakali river.

From 1816 until 1857, all maps produced by British cartographers suggested that the origin of the river lay in the Limpiyadhura area. This infers that the land to the west of the river &ndash; including the Kalapani area and Liulekh pass &ndash; belong to Nepal, and so supports Nepal&rsquo;s claim over the region.

After 1857, apparently realising the strategic significance of the Kalapani region, British officials started to publish maps which referred to Lipulekh pass as the origin of the Mahakali river &ndash; then called the Kali river &ndash; which supported India&rsquo;s claim over the Kalapani region. India-China trade Since the early 1950s, India and China have entered into a series of agreements which mention Lipulekh pass as a potential trade route between the two countries.

Most recently, a Sino-Indian trade pact in 2015 mentioned the Lipulekh pass as the tri-junction between Nepal, India and China &ndash; without consulting Nepal. Nepal maintains that the Limpiyadhura area is the tri-junction &ndash; and so asserts that Lipulekh pass is the part of Nepal. There is still no formal agreement between the three countries on where the border between them actually lies. Nepal is therefore furious that efforts to establish a trade route between India and China could overshadow its own territorial integrity. To Nepal, China&rsquo;s trade agreements with India, and use of the Lipulekh pass, act as an informal declaration that the pass is the origin of Mahakali river.

Because of this, what has been a historic bilateral issue between Nepal and India over the Kalapani region has been transformed into a trilateral one. As a small but independent and sovereign country, Nepal has few options to resist the territorial ambitions of India and China. It must tread carefully and deploy all its political and diplomatic capital to start a dialogue with both Asian superpowers to reach a comprehensive and amicable agreement.

One way forward might be to form an independent committee of inquiry &ndash; acceptable to both India and Nepal &ndash; made up of international experts in hydrology, geography, cartography and politics. Sandwiched between India and China, Nepal cannot risk alienating either of them at this stage. But amid the cloud of uncertainty and fear, the harsh geopolitical reality is that Nepal risks losing its bargaining power and getting caught in the middle of the China-India rivalry.

http://english.ratopati.com/story/13860,"Kathmandu - (Narayan Neupane) The prorogation of the ongoing Parliament session without consultation with the stakeholders on Thursday has rippled the pro-federalist and pro-parliamentary forces. At a time when the meeting of the National Assembly was running, a letter from the Office of the President arrived at the Federal Parliament Secretariat that stated the prorogation of the ongoing budget session of the Federal Parliament.

The Speaker of the House of Representatives (HoR) himself was unaware of this development. It not only created waves on political circle but also drew attention from the political analysts and legal experts. Likewise, opposition Nepali Congress is also not very happy with the government&#39;s decision to prorogue the House session as a result of the intra-party feuds in the ruling Nepal Communist Party.

This year&#39;s budget session continued for 56 days and 26 meetings of the HoR took place during the period. The next meeting of the HoR was summoned for July 6 but the House session was suspended abruptly. However, the decision taken by the government without informing the Speaker, National Assembly Chairperson and main opposition party is perceived as an unusual move by the experts of the constitutional laws.

In this session, 14 bills including four private ones in the HoR were registered while there were five bills registered in the National Assembly. During the period, eight bills were passed and 19 others are under consideration. Ruling Nepal Communist Party&#39;s lawmaker Haribol Gajurel said an unease situation was created as the parliament session was prorogued all of a sudden at a time when the parliament was expected to finalize seven important bills including the bill on citizenship.

He said the issues of public concerns should not have impacted from the intraparty feuds. &quot;The established notion to end the House session after consulting the Speaker is ruptured. The dignity and honour of the post of the Speaker is hurt,&quot; he argued. Similarly, General Secretary of Samajbadi Party Ramsahay Prasad Yadav argued the move as undemocratic. Talking to the National News Agency (RSS), he said abrupt prorogation of the budget session of federal parliament was not good as the House had some important business including on citizenship bill and civil service bill.

It shows the irresponsibility of the government on important issues. Similarly, Rastriya Janata Party Chief Whip Laxman Lal Karna argued that the latest move of the government to suspend ongoing session was not appropriate as important bills were under discussion. He added that it was unexpected to prorogue the session without consulting the House Speaker and it has curtailed peoples&rsquo; voice.

Likewise, Nepali Congress Whip Pushpa Bhusal said sudden end of the session is not good as it is a platform to make the government accountable. She said that the citizenship bill and civil service bill were ready for finalization in the session. Rastriya Janamorcha lawmaker Durga Poudel opined that the untimely end of the budget session was not logical. Speaker and other political party leaders should have been consulted before reaching to any conclusion.

However, Nepal Workers and Peasants Party lawmaker Prem Suwal said there is a convention that government gives agenda to parliament and summons and ends it. So, the parliament session may have been ended as per the law, he responded. Rastriya Prajatantra Party lawmaker Rajendra Lingden said the abrupt prorogation of the parliament session is the reflection of political mess.

Although the budget had incorporated some activities for the implementation of the compact, the difference within the ruling party halted it, pointing out the need of approval first by the parliament for undertaking the activities. Earlier, the standing committee of the NCP had witnessed severe difference over the MCC pact resulting to the formation of a team to study its broader impact.

http://english.ratopati.com/story/13811,"Kathmandu - Various non-government organizations, private sector and individuals based in German have initiated lobby for continuing with Germany development cooperation to Nepal. The move came at a time when Nepal&#39;s time-tested friend Federal Republic of Germany has started a process to gradually axe its bilateral assistance to Nepal from 2024.

The issue is being discussed at the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) of Germany &ndash; which has been aiding Nepal mainly in the areas of economic development, good governance and poverty alleviation. It is critically important for Nepal as it would decide the fate of bilateral development cooperation received from Germany for the past six decades.

However, the Germany ministry&#39;s parliamentary committee has started the process to pull its hand of bilateral cooperation from other 24 countries across the globe including Nepal by 2030. If the decision takes place, there will be no new contract for development cooperation from 2024 in Nepal and the time interval will be utilized for completing the ongoing projects.

With this the Germany aid will be limited and channelized only through the European Union&#39;s Lump sum assistance to Nepal. The Germany ministry has been annually channelizing 250,000 Euro to support Nepal&#39;s efforts for development and good governance. Nevertheless, the Germany-based German-Nepal Friendship Association and a local NGO namely Long Yang took the joint initiative to submit appeal and open letter to the BMZ to perpetuate aid to Nepal, shared Association chair Ram Pratap Thapa.

The appeal was signed by 1,500 well-wishers of Nepal while 50 Germany-based NGOs that have been lending support to Nepal have also jointly urged the ministry to continue with the cooperation to Nepal, Thapa added. Earlier, the Nepal German Academic Association on May 23 had organized a virtual meeting of the representatives from NGOs and private sector and requested the ministry to not reach to a decision to stop aid.

It is noted that the government of Nepal has made necessary homework to this effect acting on the informal communication regarding the aid cut-off. Jenny Ludwig, a representative of Long Yang, said that the Germany assistance to Nepal was not limited to economic front but was important for advancement of new skills and knowledge and development of new technology. He further noted that Germany had substantially aided Nepal to her development efforts during the 61 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two.",-,-

According to Shalikram Adhikari, chief of Agriculture Knowledge Centre, Syangja, there were signs of a good paddy yield in Kaski this year. According to him, paddy was planted across 25,600 hectares of land in the district last year which had produced 95 metric tons of rice.

This year, as Adhikari added, the paddy output could reach 100,000 metric tons if no other problems such as heavy rainfall, hailstorm, locusts menace among others crop up. According to him, Jethobudho, an aromatic species of rice is mostly planted in the district although over 100 sub-species of rice were found to have been used by the farmer.

He added that the locusts which reportedly entered Nepal on Saturday are not likely to cause damages to crop here as the locusts swarms have been diverted elsewhere. Since a small unit of locusts has been reported to have entered Nepal, it does not pose a huge risk for bigger agriculture damage, Adhikari said. Similarly, rice researcher Bhanu Parajuli shared that paddy plantation in Kaski dates back to 1500.

The first species of rice planted here was Samundrafij. In Begnas of Lekhnath Municipality, farmers use 74 sub-species of rice, Parajuli informed. &ldquo;Since the weather is favorable this time and many farmers have ample time to devote to agriculture activities due to COVID-19 pandemic, the paddy yield is estimated to be bumper this year in Kaski.&rdquo; Farmer Kaladhar Bhadari of Thulakhet in Pokhara-23 shared that he had been planting Jethobudho rice in his 8 ropani of land.

In his best wishes on the occasion of the 17th National Paddy Day and Transplanting Festival here today, the Prime Minister insisted on not letting arable land go waste, not keeping such land barren and focusing on the enhancement of agro yields and productivity as per the nature and quality of soil. As he said the celebration of the Day would inspire us to step up towards the destination of self-sufficiency on food.

National Rice Day is celebrated with the theme of &lsquo;increase rice production for self- sufficiency and prosperity&rsquo; Stating that ensuring people&rsquo;s basic food security was the responsibility of a public welfare state, he said the constitution has guaranteed the right to food under the fundamental rights of the citizens. We have already the act relating to right to food and food soveirgnity-2075 to implement such right.

The act has acknowledged every citizen&rsquo;s right to food, food security and food sovereignty as the legal rights of people and we are clear in our national commitments towards the improvement of the status of food and nutrition security through the implementation of international resolutions and agricultural development strategies in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals which envisage a hunger-free society.

Stating that demand for paddy had been rampant in the past few years due to the population growth and improvement in people&rsquo;s economic status, he said but the domestic production failing to meet the growing demand for rice had resulted in the huge expenditure to import rice.

He said, &quot;It has also increased country&#39;s dependency. Bearing this in mind, the Government of Nepal has emphatically formulated a policy and plan, and subsequently executed them to address the issue of increasing paddy productivity and sustaining food security in the country&quot;. The message further reads, &quot;The incumbent government has been giving priority on expanding irrigation facility, research and development of paddy crops, managing subsidized quality seeds and manure, expanding technology and technical assistance and knowledge to farmers, reforming public distribution system and determining fixed price of agro products, among others.

However, there is a need of coordinated and concerted efforts from all three tiers of governments towards sustaining food security and reducing dependency in the country.

http://english.ratopati.com/story/13896,"By Promod Tandan ,Kathmandu - A tense military standoff between China and India over a disputed border area in the Himalayas has put much of the region on edge. Not least in Nepal, which has its own ongoing land dispute with India and where concern is mounting that the India-China power play could damage its territorial integrity.

On June 15, after weeks of escalating tensions, violent clashes broke out between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the border in the Galwan Valley of the Ladakh region, claimed by both India and China. Dozens of Indian soldiers were reportedly killed. India and China have been steadily increasing the number of their troops on either side of the line of actual control, which has separated Chinese Tibet from Indian Ladakh since the 1962 Sino-Indian war.

Since that same conflict, India has systematically stationed military troops in the Kalapani area further to the west where the borders of Nepal, China and India meet. But Nepal argues that the Kalapani region lies within its territory. Amid the latest tensions between India and China, Nepal is furious that its own border dispute with India could be sidelined. Route through the mountains The 335 sq km area between the areas of Limpiyadhura and Kalapani and the Lipulekh pass &ndash; collectively referred as Kalapani region &ndash; holds strategic significance because of its geography.

The Lipulekh pass &ndash; which Nepal claims as part of its own territory &ndash; is the shortest land route from India to China and already an important trade route. To consolidate its claim over the Kalapani region, in November 2019 the Indian government unilaterally published a new map that included the region within Indian territory.

This was followed in May by the inauguration of a new 75km road linking Dharchula in India via the Lipulekh pass to the Kailash-Mansarover area in the Tibetan plateau in China. The road also joins the Mansarover lake to the base of Mount Kailash, an important site for both Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims.

There were widespread public protests in Nepal at India&rsquo;s actions. In retaliation, Nepal unveiled its own new map in late May which included the Kalapani region as part of Nepal which was approved by Nepal&rsquo;s parliament and the president in late June. Nepal&rsquo;s prime minister, Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, said he was not bothered if the map angered anyone and that &ldquo;we will reclaim that land at any cost&rdquo;.

Source of the Mahakali river Nepal&rsquo;s claim to the region and the Lipulekh pass stems from the 1816 Treaty of Sugauli it entered with the British colonial rulers that defined its western border with India at the end of a two-year long war. After Partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947, both India and Nepal subsequently accepted the Mahakali river as the defining boundary of the west of Nepal. However, the issue has been complicated by disputed historical maps relating to the origin of the Mahakali river.

From 1816 until 1857, all maps produced by British cartographers suggested that the origin of the river lay in the Limpiyadhura area. This infers that the land to the west of the river &ndash; including the Kalapani area and Liulekh pass &ndash; belong to Nepal, and so supports Nepal&rsquo;s claim over the region.

After 1857, apparently realising the strategic significance of the Kalapani region, British officials started to publish maps which referred to Lipulekh pass as the origin of the Mahakali river &ndash; then called the Kali river &ndash; which supported India&rsquo;s claim over the Kalapani region. India-China trade Since the early 1950s, India and China have entered into a series of agreements which mention Lipulekh pass as a potential trade route between the two countries.

Most recently, a Sino-Indian trade pact in 2015 mentioned the Lipulekh pass as the tri-junction between Nepal, India and China &ndash; without consulting Nepal. Nepal maintains that the Limpiyadhura area is the tri-junction &ndash; and so asserts that Lipulekh pass is the part of Nepal. There is still no formal agreement between the three countries on where the border between them actually lies. Nepal is therefore furious that efforts to establish a trade route between India and China could overshadow its own territorial integrity. To Nepal, China&rsquo;s trade agreements with India, and use of the Lipulekh pass, act as an informal declaration that the pass is the origin of Mahakali river.

Because of this, what has been a historic bilateral issue between Nepal and India over the Kalapani region has been transformed into a trilateral one. As a small but independent and sovereign country, Nepal has few options to resist the territorial ambitions of India and China. It must tread carefully and deploy all its political and diplomatic capital to start a dialogue with both Asian superpowers to reach a comprehensive and amicable agreement.

One way forward might be to form an independent committee of inquiry &ndash; acceptable to both India and Nepal &ndash; made up of international experts in hydrology, geography, cartography and politics. Sandwiched between India and China, Nepal cannot risk alienating either of them at this stage. But amid the cloud of uncertainty and fear, the harsh geopolitical reality is that Nepal risks losing its bargaining power and getting caught in the middle of the China-India rivalry.

http://english.ratopati.com/story/13906,"Kathmandu - Ramchandra Neupane The transportation has been completely halted in Dolpa district since the government imposed the nationwide lockdown on March 24, to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, people are facing hardship to travel from one place to another. Most of the places are beyond the access of public transport.

However, some are in limited access. Meanwhile, transport entrepreneurs are found arbitrarily charging fare from passengers. Mainly, jeep operators are charging high fares to passengers taking the benefit of lockdown these days. The jeep passengers travelling to and from the district headquarters, Dunai, from various places in the district are compelled to pay high fare.

It is said that the locals in the district are paying high fares for short distance as they have no alternative to travelling by paying high fare. The jeep operators along the road section from Dunai-Supani, Supani-Dunai, Dunai-Jufal and Jufal-Dunai are charging high fares. Locals complained that they were paying Rs 1,600 per head to and from Dunai though it&#39;s short distance.

Bharun Sarki of Tripurasundari-1 complained that they were paying the amount for a jeep ride on only 14 kilometers distance whereas the fare is Rs 150 per person for the same distance in Terai. The district administration office has permitted to travel three passengers in a single vehicle maintaining social distancing.

But the transport entrepreneurs are found carrying six passengers violating the DAO directives, said another local Ramesh Pariyar. He added that they were travelling by paying Rs 350 for the same distance before the lockdown but now transport operators are charging fare arbitrarily. Traffic police annoyed The unruly and rowdy behaviour of jeep drivers have caused nuisance to one and all in Dolpa including the traffic police personnel.

They arbitrarily ply their vehicle on the road and hardly comply with the traffic rules. When the traffic police attempt to take action against them for violating the traffic rules, they tend to get annoyed and harshly retaliate instead, said one of the traffic personnel in Dolpa. &ldquo;It&#39;s very difficult to work in Dolpa. According to the rule, we can not allow public vehicles to operate but the private vehicles have been allowed to ply the road on the even-odd number plate basis since the lockdown was eased.&quot;

He further shared that vehicle with red number plate (private ones) have been providing public services in Dolpa right under the nose of the traffic police. He explained, &ldquo;The drivers have been charging exorbitantly with the passengers. We try and convince them to charge a fair fare fixed by the stakeholders but to no avail.

&rdquo; He expressed his dismay that when they try to take action against such unruly drivers, the drivers make the local people&rsquo;s representatives intervene on their behalf and pile pressure on the traffic police to exempt them from facing action. CDO of Dolpa Suresh Sunar said that they will soon hold discussion about exorbitant fare and take necessary action. The locals opine that they were forced to pay expensive fare because of the government employees in Dolpa.

According to them, the government employees reserve the vehicle and offer a handsome price for the service. The jeep drivers are thus more eager to ferry government employees instead of commoners. An employee pays Rs 4000 to Rs 5000 to reserve a jeep, according to the vehicle entrepreneurs here.

The local government and District Administration Office are overlooking the ongoing situation, complain locals. Civic Society Dolpa&rsquo;s Chairperson Sher Bahadur Budha shared that Tripura Sundari Municipality, Thulibheri Municipality and local administration have not been tightening the noose against the erring jeep drivers. Although a fix fare has been prepared for different routes and stations, due to its lax implementation the locals are forced to pay through their nose.",-,-

Most of the time he walks to Mangalbazaar which is five kilometres from his home. Only sometimes and if he is lucky he gets lift from motorcycle and vehicle drivers.

Many do not stop their vehicle when he stops them for sharing a ride for fear of COVID-19.

Now, the lockdown has been relaxed to some extent and Shrestha has no option than opening his shop for livelihood support.

For him, a native of Harisiddhhi, the need for owning a vehicle had never been felt now than before. He had not felt this need during normal times as travelling to and fro his shop was not that difficult as adequate number of public transport vehicles operated. In this connection, he recalls his experience five years back when there was a blockade in the country. The undeclared blockade was imposed by India and there was shortage of essentials and fuel.

That time also there were no public vehicles due to fuel shortage. But people used to give a lift to the needy. But, Shrestha said, the situation is not like that at present. People are very reluctant to offer a lift and share a ride for fear of COVID-19. So, Shrestha has to walk most often to his shop and back home.

Dwellers of Srilanka, Tikapur-8, they said they could not go to bed confidently since couple of days as it continues to rain since Monday night. As a result, the Karnali River has swelled up causing rampant soil erosion in the locality.

Local Jhapat Budha said with the incessant rain, the river has changed its course and the soil erosion that had begun in March-April has intensified now. &#39;&#39;We stay awake all night for fear of the river entering our settlement any time when it starts raining.&#39;&#39; The rain since Monday night has increased water level in the river.

Local teacher Padam Budha said &#39;&#39;when rain begins, we climb up to higher areas to save the life from possible consequences. It means that life here goes with the constant fear of encountering tragedy during monsoon.&#39;&#39; He went on to say that once rain started, their entire attention got diverted to river to see whether it would turn violent. According to him, waters level in the river goes up when there is rainfall in the hilly region.

Now, river has encroached upon a large area of arable land. People of Srilanka like Khadak Saud, Kalu Saud, Gopal Saud, Balbire Tamata, Dangla Chaudhary and Deependra Bhandari have already lost hundreds of bigha ( 6,772.63 square metres) of land in total to the disaster. The river is eroding over 20 bigha of land every year here. Ward no 1 in the then Dhansinghpur VDC has massively suffered erosion, shared Kalu Saud.

The river is converting arable land into deserts. Around 1,000 bigha of land was swept away by the river in the recent three years, he said. &#39;&#39; Soil here is suitable for all almost all sorts of crops. But now people are discouraged for doing crops cultivation. In the past, there were 500 houses. Most of them have been displaced and now it is home to around 80 families. But we live in constant fear of being displaced or facing a tragedy at any time.

&rdquo; Srilanka situating on the border of Kailali and Bardiya is mostly affected by the flood. The erosion has become aggressive with Bardiya constructing the river embankment towards its territory. The problem which had begun in 2060 BS has been aggressive in the past three years. After the river continued erosion, the locals constructed embankment employing bio-engineering method on their own efforts. They shared that after the river posed threat to enter the village, they had no option but to create biological embankment.

The irrigation project has been constructing embankment along the Karnali River for five years. But it has not been completed yet. Ward Chairman Thakulla said the recklessness of contractors has caused imminent risk of floods and inundation. Border pillar falling into river With the constant erosion, the pillars on Nepal-India border are falling into the river every year.

The river had begun cutting the no man&#39;s land between Nepal and India since first week of Baisakh.

Meteorologist Pratibha Manandhar said there was the possibility of increased monsoon activities in the next four days due to the location of the monsoon low pressure system near the Tarai region of Nepal.

According to her, heavy rainfall is forecast at some places of State-1, State-2, Bagmati State and Gandaki State. &quot;The monsoon still has time before it exits. Therefore, the current amount of rainfall cannot be said to be the year&#39;s heaviest,&quot; she said. It is predicted that largest amount of rainfall so far will occur in State-1, State-2, Bagmati State and Gandaki State in the coming four days ever since the start of the monsoon.

Rainfall more than 100 millimetres during the monsoon is called heavy rain whereas up to 50 millimetres rainfall is termed as heavy at other times. Since it is presently monsoon, rainfall up to 50 millimetres is termed as from light to moderate. Heavy rainfall has increased the risk of flood, inundation and landslide as a lot of rainfall has been taking place since mid-April this year.

There is possibility of occurrence of floods in the rivulets, brooks, streams, rivers and lakes in the hilly region.

http://english.ratopati.com/story/14019,"Kathmandu - Birat Anupam Exactly on the same day today 54 years ago, Ram Bahadur Limbu was conferred the prestigious Victoria Cross at the Buckingham Palace of the British monarch. The British Queen had decorated Limbu with the VC on 12 July 1966. After 54 years of this great military achievement, the 85-year-old Limbu is the only surviving Victoria Cross recipient Nepali Gurkha soldier.

Out of hundreds of Gurkha soldiers fighting on behalf of British military in the first and second world wars and also in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Borneo, Cyprus, the Falklands, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, among others, 13 Nepalese Gurkha soldiers have been awarded the Victoria Cross so far.

Limbu is the last and the only surviving Victoria Cross recipient Gurkha soldier in the more than 200 years of the British Gurkha service in British military that includes the death of thousands of Nepalese Gurkhas with 43,000 deaths in two world wars. Gurkha soldiers of the British Army are regarded as &#39;brave&#39;. And, Victoria Cross (VC) recipients are termed &#39;braver&#39;. Ram Bahadur Limbu is the only living Nepalese Gurkha soldier holding the VC title to his prestigious British Army career from 1960 to 1985.

True to the motto of the Gurkha regiments, which goes, &#39;Better to Die than to be a Coward&#39;, Limbu was awarded this coveted title for his bravery in a war of Indonesian Confrontation on 21 November 1965 in Sarawak, Borneo. The then Lance-Corporal Limbu was awarded the honorary captain (504075) of the British military.

Limbu has exclusively shared his interesting seven secrets as a veteran and brave fighter from Nepal. 1. The youngest VC recipient Ram Bahadur Limbu was a 26-year-old member of the 2nd Battalion, 10th Princess Mary&#39;s Own Gurkha Rifles when he got the VC. He is still in the Guinness Book of World Records as the &#39;youngest living VC recipient&#39;. Besides being the youngest VC recipient, he is the only member of Gurkha soldier to win VC after World War-2. Likewise, he is the only member to beg VC from 10th Princess Mary&#39;s Own Gurkha Rifles so far. 2. The only surviving sibling of the family Limbu was born to an extended family of Chyangthapu of Panchthar district of Nepal.

His father Tekbir Limbu was a farmer and his mother Tunimaya Limbu was a homemaker of a lower middle-class family in the eastern hills of Nepal. He had four brothers and two sisters. Tragically, he is the only surviving sibling of his family. He has also lost many of his contemporary friends both in his villages and at his military service. 3. Two marriages After around seven years of service into the British military, Limbu was awarded VC from Queen on 12 July 1966 Buckingham Palace.

His tiny son of around five-year-old accompanied him. He lost his wife just around the announcement of his VC. His first fianc&eacute; Tika Maya Begha Limbu passed away on 6 February 1966 in Singapore. He had married with Tika Maya on 31 January 1961 at the hilly hamlet of Perunge, Chyangthapu of Panchthar district. Just a year after the tragic demise of his first wife, he tied his knot with Punimaya Narthung Chamling Rai on 8 April 1967. He has two sons each from his wives. 4. VC medal stolen at a railway journey of India Just a year after being awarded VC, Limbu made his journey to his motherland Nepal via Indian transit.

Railway thieves stole his VC when he was in his catnap. Again, he got his replacement. 5. Time-strict personality One of his residencies is in Damak town of eastern Nepal. The town is also the constituency of the incumbent Prime Minister of Nepal, K.P. Sharma Oli. Limbu is highly unhappy at procrastination of different social and public functions in the town.

He did not entertain five-minute delay to this interview. He angrily said, &#39;&#39;Not only journalists of Nepal, even the PM comes late in formal functions. I have waited him for hours in this town. This does not happen in United Kingdom&#39;&#39; 6. Great philanthropist Octogenarian Limbu is a famed philanthropist. He has donated millions of Nepalese rupees for the constructions of community buildings, temples and public properties in various places of Nepal.

Limbu has supported funds to construct road linking his birthplace Chyangthapu. He has donated plots of land for the construction of &#39;Kirat temple&#39;. &#39;&#39;I see people turning philanthropists by using black money&#39;&#39;, said Limbu who has difficulties to hear. He added, &#39;&#39;I am happy to utilize my hard-earned white money for philanthropy.

&#39;&#39; 7. A leader of Gurkha struggle on discriminatory pay There is a big payment difference between Nepali Gurkhas and the British-born soldiers in the UK Army. Captain Ram Bahadur Limbu is not happy on this tragedy. He has led a struggle for petitioning the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair demanding same pay and pension. His initiation was actively supported by British actress Joanna Lumley. (photo available)",-,-

Indian security personnel now are preventing local residents from moving to the vicinity of Kalapani origin which was not blocked before.

With the Nepal government unveiling a new political administrative map including Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, the Indian security force has further come down to Nepali territory and ramped up their presence and surveillance. It may be noted that the Indian side has further expanded its barricade to Nepali land by a kilometer to crackdown people&#39;s mobility.

The Indian security has obstructed Nepali security personnel while the latter were heading to see the origin of the Mahakali River.

Local people are not in a position to reach there now. India has made a bulk presence of its security personnel at Kalapani area with the escalation of border dispute between India and China of late. According to a Nepali security personnel deputed in Byas, the Indian security are preventing us from going to the origin of the Mahakali. &quot;We urged them to allow to reach there without possessing weapon&quot;, he said, adding they however stopped us to take stride&quot;.

Locals from Chhangaru used to reach up to the modified origin of Mahakali and Kali Temple constructed at Kalapani. Nepali residents have demanded the placement of security posts at Kauwa area with the Indian security attempting to put the area under their control.

&quot;We have frequently urged the authorities to place the armed police post at Kauwa area&quot;, said Ashok Singh Bohora, ward chair of Byas rural municipality-1.
