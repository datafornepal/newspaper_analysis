http://english.ratopati.com/story/12287,"Kathmandu - As the spread of coronavirus pneumonia has created risks on multiple sectors, the government has come up with some measures to tackle those impacts of COVID-19 on economy and other areas expecting to maintain stability. Against this backdrop, Minister for Finance, who is also the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Dr Yubaraj Khaitwada has talked to Rastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS) about the government measures to combat COVID-19, economic relief packages and other things that the government has pushed forward. &ldquo;First of all the country is in a difficult situation. All the problems that we encounter are not created by ourselves. But, we have to face the problems created by others. All political parties, civil society, industrialists, entrepreneurs and the media should stand in a single point at this difficult hour,&rdquo; Minister Dr Khatiwada told the RSS.

Calling the need for authentic news dissemination, the Communications and Information Minister said the social networking sites users also should give only correct information, adding no one should work to create fear and terror in the society. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to say anything about the responsibility of the press. The media outlets are the main medium for the news dissemination. We expect them responsible and support to the government,&rdquo; Dr Khatiwada shared his expectations from the media. The private media outlets are doing good job and the state-owned media are also expected to carry on news on factual basis without being influenced by any prejudices and limiting their products on the government programmes, he added. Regarding the government decisions, the Finance Minister argued that the decisions were timely and for the control of coronavirus spread. We suspended the international flights and borders.

But, if there were some Nepalis infected (with COVID-19) before the closure of flights and borders, he questioned, adding that the local levels are supposed to take information on the infected persons, if any. The government is sincere towards the supply of basic essential goods so that the citizens won&rsquo;t be victims for lack of those highly essential goods, he said. Minister Dr Khatiwada was of the view that the government&rsquo;s major strategy at this point of time is to ease the supply system without risking the lives of citizens and improving the gaps if any. On the recent decisions of cabinet meeting, the government spokesperson defended the move to impose a ban on the imports of black pepper, dry dates, green peas and liquors arguing that Nepal has already imported those goods that is sufficient for years, not only for a single year. He also said that the bordering areas became the site for illegal trade of those goods which forced the government to impose restrictions on them. He was of the view that the government decision will help save our foreign exchanges and added that import of sophisticated vehicles is also discouraged while calling for investing that amount in capital formation. &ldquo;You media persons should put your analysis on the taken decisions,&rdquo; Dr Khatiwada said.

In a question on appointment of Nepal Rastra Bank&rsquo;s governor, he said the government will decide after the end of the lockdown period. Making it clear about the gravity of some key decisions taken by the Sunday Cabinet meeting to contain the spread and impact of coronavirus, the Finance Minister said the decisions featured some important steps that government had to be taken for the security and protection of vulnerable community such as grassroots people and daily wage earners during the crisis. As he said, daily-wage workers are primarily facing two types of problems: first, their income source has stopped with lockdown and second they have no stock of daily essentials for future. In this context, the mobilisation of local levels has been sought to identify such community and take measures for preventing them from suffering hunger by ensuring their daily minimum food requirement. But, contribution from individual level, social organisations, state level and even from the federation was necessary to set up a fund to manage two square of meals for such community, he stressed. He went on to say that besides the government had realised that expectant mothers, new mothers, aged people, orphans, and persons with disabilities might need special protections and care at this moment, adding the government had made some special provisions for employees with minimum income.

With a growing health risk from coronavirus, a new trend has developed in the society: tenants are being told to leave the house for fear of infection and professionals like doctors, nurses and health workers face fears of being shunned by others and amidst these adversities caused by the crisis, we have called on house owners to show humanity, not to ask tenants to vacate rooms and to waive one month&#39;s rent and hope that they will heartily accept the urge which will be appreciated by the goveremnt. This is for the common good of all Nepali not for the government sole interest, according to the government Spokesperson. &quot;We have some issues related to health services ahead. Tax discount has been ensured in the import of medical equipment,&quot; he said, informing that the deadline for clearing the principle of debt and interest had been extended to till mid-July, the rate of refinance had been reduced and ceiling of a renewed loan had been increased to Rs 60 billion.

He further said 25 percent discount had been given in the electricity tariff in the consumption of up to 150 units in view of the possible shortage of cooking gas in this time of difficulty. &#39;&#39;On one hand, available electricity has not been fully used and on the other hand, the government is giving subsidy in cooking gas cylinders which causes the government Rs 290 loss in each cylinder. It has been realised that it would be better to promote the use of electricity to reduce the use of cooking gas. As a result, power consumption has increased.&#39;&#39; Besides, customs duty has been exempted in the import of induction stove. At this hour, we urge every Nepali household to use induction stove and increase power consumption. We have plentiful electricity for the domestic consumption. The government has promised 30-50 percent discount on electricity tariff for big industries for off-time production so as to utilise power going waste during nighttime, according to him. On a query how the government would assure public regarding implementation of such crucial decisions, he said the ward office would be mobilized as a centre in identifying the needy and distributing reliefs while local level would act a coordinating role and state government would provide support. &quot;We have made the local mechanism responsible in the people&#39;s representative system. Mobilizing the mechanism would also stem the chance for misuse of relief&quot;, he said. Wards possessing higher number of population can mobilize volunteers and humanitarian organizations such as Red Cross and Scout, he said, adding the targeted beneficiaries could be provided with the services by mobilizing volunteers.

&quot;Resource would be mobilized in a collective manner for that and it would be managed from federal reserve in case of inadequacy&quot;, he said, adding Nepal Rastra Bank ahs already made decision in regard to the banking system. He again called for the house owners, schools and health services to waiver the rents and fees to who philanthropic gesture in difficult time. On another query on private hospital&#39;s reluctance to comply with government directive, he said the Corona Control Management Committee which was formed on Sunday would monitor the issue. &quot;The private hospital should also provide services; no hospital should remain aloof from this responsibility&quot;, he said the government has started managing health appliances, safety equipments and medicines. &quot;The government would provide subsidy to the hospitals through the budget, policy and programme but their support is a precondition for this to happen&quot;. Regarding extension of lockdown period, the minister said the government has decided to close the international border entry points (surface and air) up to April 7 (12.00 in the night) and keep the lockdown period up to the same time.

On a query regarding potential impacts of coroanvirus in Nepali economy, Dr Khatiwada said it is early to project the loss it has caused to the economy. &quot;Most of our development works take place from mid-February to mid-May. It seems the opportunity is almost missed. Likewise the month of February and March is the season for tourists&#39; arrival which is also doomed. The outflow to foreign countries for employment has also come to an end&quot;. This of course would limit our economic growth but we are assessing the effects of COVID-9 in our economy, he added. &quot;If we see other countries in the world the pandemic is estimated to cause drop of economic growth by 1 to 2 percent&quot;, he said. He stated that saying six percent growth rate therefore comes to five or 4.5 per cent growth and it would make up to two per cent loss in this current fiscal year if the risk of coronavirus prolongs. Finance minister Khatiwada said the path of prosperity is not the matter of calculating by months, days and years, it is the matter of decades, adding that the country could gain momentum again. He added that the means and resources and capacity should be kept intact.

Responding to the query about preparation of budget for next fiscal year, the Finance Minister said that preparation about the budget was underway and it would be unveiled in the statutory date of Jestha 15 ((May 28) even if corona or other any problems surface. He said, &ldquo;We have been working in difficult situation in order to bring budget. Discussion is underway to give basic ceiling of budget to every ministry. Talks are being held on main programmes. Discussion on budget with National Planning Commission and ministries has been postponed. But ministries have made their own preparations.&rdquo; He further said that there would be impact on remittance as well as two or three other sectors and there is no situation to remit money from abroad. Saying those who are abroad could not send money few months even if they return to work once coronavirus infection comes under control, minister Khatiwada said they have expected only Rs 800 billion as remittance. The Finance Minister shared information that the Ministry has been managing inflation by bringing liberal monetary policy. Extending gratitude towards those who supported the government during this hour, he said businessperson should be accountable. All should do ethical business, said Minister Khatiwada.

Ethical business means business with some norms and values. Likewise, he said that the people should voluntarily abide by the government steps that are aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19. Dr Khatiwada also called for self-discipline since this order was proposed to safeguard the lives of the citizens. &ldquo;This is the government directive for self obedience. This is for our own security,&rdquo; he said, adding it was for preventing the possible outbreak of coronavirus.&nbsp;",-,-

Involuntarily, week by week Nepal&rsquo;s population, joined by the global community, will find itself compelled to abandon hitherto starry-eyed views of &lsquo;America&rsquo; as redeemer, source of truths, and all things good. (It&rsquo;s already happening.)

&nbsp;Working in your country for over four decades, I&rsquo;ve never met people more enthralled with the U.S. as you are. Everyone I know strives to send children here. You order your iphone direct from U.S.A.; you quote the NY Times and CNN; villagers too consult Facebook for &lsquo;reliable&rsquo; news; Kathmandu residents patronize your local reproduction of Starbucks and Pizza Hut. (The only exception to these addictions is Hindi dramas; they&rsquo;re accessed from India.)

On its side, America too is charmed by Nepal. We admire your beguiling, robed monks, your extravagant and vibrant Hindu rituals, and docile residents welcoming us on treks through your Himalaya. 

Appreciating the value of your exceptional loyalty (perhaps based on historical Gurkha-Britishalliances) the U.S. extends an open door to Nepalis: with your abiding charm, your industrious&nbsp; graduates and Buddhist gurus, and your 6,000 earthquake victims, (admitted on TPS-visas in 2015, regardless of their largely fraudulent claims, then granted extensions last year).&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Politically, Nepalis are inexplicably complacent at home. For most of your history you were subjected to the rule of absolute monarchs. Although never occupied by foreign invaders. Following your successful 10-year Maoist guerilla campaign, you eventually rid yourselves of that oppressive sacred kingship. That was followed by your declaration as a republic, multi-party involvement, a democratic constitution and a 2015 election&nbsp; that endowed the winning Marxist/Leninist Party with power. Few lives had been lost in that process and expectations were high moving ahead. Despite the ended monarchy, an expanded free press, a vibrant tourism industry and the injection of foreign aid, your nation&rsquo;s economy was never reformed, your class disparities never addressed. The elite remained entrenched; favoritism, corruption, graft, and nepotism deepened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corruption is worse today than ever. Although officially secular, consumptive spending on temples and rituals has increased, and high caste privilege remains. Your economy is crippled: as new plutocrats sap the wealth, your administration grows fat on bribes while allowing ordinary families to depend on overseas remittances; (5-7 million jobless, a fifth of your 28 million, are migrant workers in Malaysia and Arab Gulf states).&nbsp; 

The U.S.&rsquo;s open door combined with the generosity of foreign social service organizations lodged in Nepal, maintains this status quo.&nbsp; 


It was to be expected that you and your government would await the arrival of foreign medics and health supplies along with instructions from here about how to treat your COVID-19 victims. Instead, growing awareness of that plague arrived with waves of those sons and brothers sent home from their curtailed employment overseas. 


It was to be expected that you and your government would await the arrival of foreign medics and health supplies along with instructions from here about how to treat your COVID-19 victims. Instead, growing awareness of that plague arrived with waves of those sons and brothers sent home from their curtailed employment overseas. (This influx may reverse the drop in agri-production after farms were abandoned or mortgaged, resulting in cash-dependency, more reliance on imported food and other needs, more demand for iNGO assistance.) 

Meanwhile, by March 15th Nepal reported only a single case of infection&mdash;a figure no Nepali accepted.

Your government (neither as impoverished nor indebted as outsiders suppose) is unabashedly corrupt and inattentive; so you&rsquo;re unsurprised at its negligence in identifying infections and moving to protect you from the spreading scourge. 


According to those of you I speak to on a weekly basis, the Nepali leadership was as slack as America in quarantining your population. You bide the time, accustomed to mismanagement and lies waiting for America&rsquo;s magic pill to arrive.


According to those of you I speak to on a weekly basis, the Nepali leadership was as slack as America in quarantining your population. You bide the time, accustomed to mismanagement and lies waiting for America&rsquo;s magic pill to arrive. (By March 28th, only 4 positive cases had been announced, again causing public skepticism.) Now on lockdown&mdash;imposed on the heels of U.S. orders for its citizens -- you can&rsquo;t even take your demands to the streets, a strategy used so effectively against your monarchy. 

While the American leadership has finally awakened to the severity of the pandemic, now rushing to contain the damage; it can draw on abundant resources, however belatedly. Nepal is slowly rousing itself, but it lacks those resources. 

In our phone conversations, it seems you feel forsaken, not by your government but by the U.S. and elsewhere. You must be shaken by witnessing the depravity of your hero. 

As you see, every government is occupied with its own overwhelmed health systems. 

If anyone comes to your rescue I expect it will be China, your northern neighbor and a steadfast benefactor. Beijing&rsquo;s earthquake aid in 2015 was immediate, efficient and unmatched. (China has had major infrastructure projects underway there&mdash;partly to balance your traditional reliance on India.) Just yesterday, responding to today&rsquo;s crisis, Chinese help is on its way to Kathmandu. Your government&rsquo;s incompetence will be ameliorated, for the present.


In the long run, your romanticized image of the omnipotent richest-country-in-the-world, will dissolve. You&rsquo;re not the alone. The world had already glimpsed the unmasked face of the global bully in the person currently occupying the White House. 


In the long run, your romanticized image of the omnipotent richest-country-in-the-world, will dissolve. You&rsquo;re not the alone. The world had already glimpsed the unmasked face of the global bully in the person currently occupying the White House. Now your view is further refined by the U.S.&rsquo; presumption of immunity, our sloppy response to the epidemic, our ill-equipped medical system, the impotence of our military might. 

It&rsquo;s time for Nepal to consider a new policy, not one that transfers over-dependence to China, but one of resourcefulness and self-sufficiency, perhaps on the model of Cuba or Vietnam. A logical step for a Marxist-led government, don&rsquo;t you think?

It may be noted that the government procured Coronavirus testing kits and personal protection equipment from China. Talking to Rastriya Samachar Samiti at the ministry on Monday, the minister said the shipments took place after announcing the bidding in a competitive way and going through the due process. He pledged to commit to his profession and not to misuse money until he is at the helm of political position. &quot;Purchasing such equipment maybe a bit costly at the time of crisis.

http://english.ratopati.com/story/12274,"It is important to discuss how the rapidly changing circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 crisis require doctors to be flexible in order to protect both their patients and the healthcare providers themselves.

Further discussion about importance of understanding the capacity of ICU beds, respirators, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), particularly the N95 mask should be done.Urologists should follow the recommendations of Government of Nepal, Centers of Disease Control (CDC) and American Urological Association(AUA) to stop performing elective procedures, but that in cases of metastasizing cancers doctors need to weigh the need for the surgery against the possibility of contracting COVID-19 while the patient is in recovery in the ICU.

We have learned important lessons from other countries. Some of them have proved themselves good to stop the further spread of the disease; some of them have been defeated in terms of controlling this disease &nbsp;just because they did not take the consequences seriously in the beginning.&nbsp;

It is important to understand the disease. As soon as we have an idea of fever, cough and shortness of breath, primary symptoms of COVID 19 which may last for 14 days after the exposure; it is important to understand how to protect ourselves. All we need to seek for the arrangement of N-95 mask and PPE. We should know exactly what sizes which may fit exactly to our face and body. We should strictly follow the updated guideline available readily in the different websites.

Urological Issues during COVID-19 in Nepal
There is ongoing lockdown countrywide. Almost all the hospitals in Nepal are limited with the provision of semi-services. Doctors and other co-health workers are accepting the lockdown discipline of the government. Rescheduling of the elective cases has been done everywhere. In spite of everything, we have similar issues almost everywhere in the countries regarding our urological patients. Every one of us might be facing the similar problems. All I have done is writing about those issues in a piece of paper. We are responsible for dealing these types of patients;

1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Routine Out patients: We request them to stay at their home and kindly wait for settlement of everything.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Elective Urological Surgeries: We have postponed them until reschedule. We admitted risk reducing strategiesfor already planned few cases.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urological Inpatients: We have discharged our almost all inpatients from the hospital except some needy. We are regularly going to the hospital for the daily rounds.&nbsp;

4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urgent and semi-urgent urological issues: We are attending 24 hours phone call of such cases and entertaining them with possible tele advice and needful medications. If necessary we are asking them to get admitted at nearby health centers and proceed for the needful interventions.&nbsp;

5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urological Cancers: We performed few urological cancer surgery on semi- emergency basis. Our routine follow up of cancer patients have been rescheduled. Those patients under ongoing chemotherapy are getting the medications according to their planned schedule.

6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urological Trauma: Since there is lockdown everywhere, We have not received any call of emergency urological trauma case.&nbsp;

What do urologists need to do for managing the urgent urological cases?

Telemedicine Practice
We can discuss telemedicine strategies for urology practices to help them cope with the COVID-19 crisis. Telemedicine has been recommended by the CDC as part of the COVID-19 response, and federal regulations have been relaxed in order to broaden access. There is recommendation of checking with both malpractice insurance as well as the different payers to ensure that telemedicine is covered before incorporating it into practice. There are several platforms that doctors can quickly integrate into their practice and explains how they work. One can easily imagine how easy they are to use for the patients and for the doctors, as well as some essential differences, specific requirements, and limitations of the telemedicine platforms.

It is highly recommended that the benefits of being a member of a physician community where doctors can support each other and discuss how to get through these difficult times. It is important for Nepalese urologists to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted telemedicine in urology from the examinations and recommendation of CDC. Recent need to keep as many patients out of the office as possible has accelerated the uptake of telemedicine in many practices and led to insurance companies relaxing regulations on its use.

It is importantfor older patients, including assigning a telemedicine manager of choosing a good platform and overcoming technical challenges. CDC further outlines the different types of telehealth consultations, from a quick check-in to a full visit, as well as requirements for visit time and audio-visual connections and concludes the article with information about billing and coding telehealth visits and how urologists can be properly reimbursed. Documentation of every attended call should be done.
Managing Emergency Surgery

CDC &amp; AUA have provided some guidance about managing the emergency cases. We should always think about preserving the resources and capacity of hospital in this difficult lockdown. All the elective cases must be postponed for reschedule. Risk reducing strategies should be applied in them with planned surgery like Ureteral stenting for some needy cases. Many of us might be getting calls for the DJ stent removal from the patients whom we have already stented for many purposes. We can deal the patients over phone call and can categorize the patient accordingly. For those emergency urological including emergency cancer surgeries, patient must be informed well about the possibilities of prolong hospital stays, ICU shift, chance of COVID-19 infection during hospital stay. This is very difficult aspect of the current situation and medical challenges. They may consequence difficult conditions. Other health staffs should be educated about COVID-19 and how to protect themselves. They should be well informed about the screening, prevention and protection from COVID-19.

Managing Urological Cancer Patients&nbsp;
People with cancer appear to be at increased risk of COVID-19, and their outcomes are worse than individuals without cancer. The NCCN Member Institutions are rapidly gaining experience in preventing and managing COVID-19. They are sharing their experience in organizing and managing institutional and care systems responses and best practices in this rapidly evolving global effort. Most cancer treatments will go ahead as normal during few week lockdown.

Routine chemotherapy will go ahead, while some other treatments may change, or be deferred, depending on each individual patient. Appointment of routine non-urgent consultation and non-urgent follow up of cancer patients can be delayed. We must be especially diligent about screening for symptoms and exposure, and we must recognize that our older patients with cancer may be especially vulnerable.

Patients with cancer who are in active treatment are immunosuppressed and are more susceptible to infection and to complications from infection, while we don&#39;t yet have much data on how COVID-19 impacts patients with cancer, we can simply suspect that patients undergoing active cancer treatment may be especially vulnerable to the more severe illness associated with COVID-19.

Those in active treatment are screened by telephone 24 to 48 hours before arrival, after which they undergo a full risk assessment in an isolation room. Those with a respiratory infection are given a mask. Each of those patients must be treated as they are positive case.

Needy patients are also advised to follow some informative blogs and websites like Centers of Disease Control (CDC) and American Urological Association (AUA). They will be benefitted well.&nbsp;

After all everything is going in a good way even during this stressful crisis. Things might be the reflection of automatic adjustment. Things are getting adjusted itself. Nepal Association of Urological Surgeons (NAUS) should publish a circular about the issues of managing such urological cases. Countrywide, the number of urologists might be enough to manage this difficult situation. All everyone might be looking for formal guidance from our national society.&nbsp;

Facing this critical situation, health care workers on the front line who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. The ever-increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases, overwhelming workload, depletion of personal protection equipment, widespread media coverage, lack of specific drugs, and feelings of being inadequately supported may all contribute to the mental burden of these health care workers.

Those health care workers feared contagion and infection of their family, friends, and colleagues, felt uncertainty and stigmatization. Experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, which could have long-term psychological implications. Similar concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising.

Psychological assistance services, including telephone-, internet-, and application-based counseling or intervention, has&nbsp; widely developed in &nbsp;local and national mental health institutions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

&nbsp;Mental health problems among health care workers treating patients with COVID-19 by &nbsp;the magnitude of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress and by analyse the potential risk factors associated with these symptoms.

The Role of Psychiatric Nurse During the Coronavirus Outbreak

Emerging infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, cause significant fear and uncertainty. Psychiatric nurse can play an important role in supporting the well-being of patients and families, healthcare personnel, and the general public.

Infectious disease outbreaks produce a range of psychological and behavioral effects. Inform patients about common responses, such as insomnia, anxiety, fear of illness, or desire to increase alcohol and tobacco use. Children and adolescents may experience regression, social isolation, or aggressive behaviors, all of which can be misinterpreted as &quot;acting out.&quot; Educate patients on ways to reduce overall stress, such as getting adequate sleep, eating regular meals, exercising, staying connected to friends and family, and relaxation techniques. Inform patients when and where to get help if needed.

Recommend HealthPromoting Behaviors

Recommend patients use trusted sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to obtain the most updated information on keeping their family safe and healthy, which can decrease distress. Encourage patients to develop a family plan for dealing with outbreaks, which reminds people there are steps they can take to care for themselves. Knowing your work and/or school plans for dealing with COVID-19 also helps reassure people about steps being taken by others to safeguard their health. Recommend patients to limit exposure to outbreak-related traditional and social media; increased media exposure is often associated with higher levels of distress.

Preparing your practice


	Promote frequent hand washing ( with soap andwateror 60% + alcohol-based hands rubs)
	Encourage respiratory etiquette (covering cough and sneezes)
	Provide tissues and trashreceptacle
	Discourage sharingof items and equipment( Mobile, pens, desks, etc)
	Maintain regular housekeeping practices, including cleaning and disinfectingsurfaces
	&nbsp;
	Maintain social distanceas much as possible


Support the Health Care System

Most patients with COVID-19 illnessrelated concerns will present in primary and emergency settings. Psychiatric nurse can play an important role in optimizing population mental health by providing interdisciplinary education, consultation, and collaboration to help colleagues more effectively identify outbreak-related distress responses and provide early interventions. Non-infected patients experiencing illness-related distress should have their concerns validated, while also helping them learn ways to more effectively cope. Interventions should serve to enhance feelings of safety, calming, self- and community efficacy, social connectedness, and hope or optimism about the future.

&nbsp;

Facilitate Problem-Solving

Uncertainty about the future is common and best addressed through practical problemsolving. For instance, Psychiatric nurse can help people consider alternative social greetings when handshaking is discouraged, or explore technology-based means of connecting for community activities when social distancing measures recommend avoiding large, group gatherings. Encourage families to involve children in problem-solving, which can decrease feelings of distress for kids. Reminding people there are steps they can take to manage through challenges enhances calming, increases selfefficacy, and reduces feelings of helplessness.

Empower Ill Patients, Their Families, and Care Providers

Psychiatric nurse can empower patients, families, and care provider through education about the psychological effects of isolation and quarantine. Short-term effects may include anxiety, anger, fear of infecting others, and frustration, with those who experience longer periods of isolation being more likely to develop post-traumatic stress symptoms or increase substance use. Ensuring quarantined patients have adequate supplies and that they and their families are given comprehensive, ongoing, updated information reduces distress and uncertainty. The use of technology to connect patients with family, friends and their health care team can decrease feelings of isolation.

Encourage Provider SelfCare

COVID-19 and other infectious disease outbreaks severely stress health systems and the providers working within them. Routine and ongoing self-care helps providers function more effectively at work and home. Sleeping, eating, hydrating, and taking breaks are important during the work-day. Providing support to peers, finding constructive solutions to work challenges, and staying connected with family and friends can lower overall stress.

Rights, roles and responsibilities of health workers, including occupational safety and health

&nbsp;Health workers are at the front line of any outbreak response and as such are exposed to hazards that put them at risk of infection with an outbreak pathogen (in this case COVID-19). Hazards include pathogen exposure, long working hours, psychological distress, fatigue, occupational burnout, stigma, and physical and psychological violence. This document highlights the rights and responsibilities of health workers, including specific measures needed to protect occupational safety and health.

Health worker rights include that employers in health facilities:


	Assume overall responsibility to ensure that all necessary preventive and protective measures are taken to minimize occupational safety and health risks
	
		Provide information, instruction and training on occupational safety and health, including;
	
	



	Refresher training on infection prevention and control (IPC); and
	Use, putting on, taking off and disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE);



	Provide adequate IPC and PPE supplies (masks, gloves, goggles, gowns, hand sanitizer, soap and water, cleaning supplies) in sufficient quantity to healthcare or other staff caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, such that workers do not incur expenses for occupational safety and health requirements.
	Familiarize personnel with technical updates on COVID-19 and provide appropriate tools to assess, triage, test and treat patients and to share infection prevention and control information with patients and the public.
	As needed, provide with appropriate security measures for personal safety.
	Provide a blame-free environment for workers to report on incidents, such as exposures to blood or bodily fluids from the respiratory system or to cases of violence, and to adopt measures for immediate followup, including support to victims.
	Advise workers on self-assessment, symptom reporting and staying home when ill;
	Maintain appropriate working hours with breaks
	Consult with health workers on occupational safety and health aspects of their work and notify the labour inspectorate of cases of occupational diseases
	Not be required to return to a work situation where there is continuing or serious danger to life or health, until the employer has taken any necessary remedial action
	Allow workers to exercise the right to remove themselves from a work situation that they have reasonable justification to believe presents an imminent and serious danger to their life or health. When a health worker exercises this right, they shall be protected from any undue consequences
	Honour the right to compensation, rehabilitation and curative services if infected with COVID-19 following exposure in the workplace. This would be considered occupational exposure and resulting illness would be considered an occupational disease
	Provide access to mental health and counselling resources; and
	Enable co-operation between management and workers and/or their representatives.


Health workers should


	Follow established occupational safety and health procedures, avoid exposing others to health and safety risks and participate in employer-provided occupational safety and health training.
	Use provided protocols to assess, triage and treat patients.
	Treat patients with respect, compassion and dignity.
	Maintain patient confidentiality.
	Swiftly follow established public health reporting procedures of suspect and confirmed cases.

	Put on, use, take off and dispose of personal protective equipment properly;
	Self-monitor for signs of illness and self-isolate or report illness to the concern person, if it occurs.
	Advise management if they are experiencing signs of undue stress or mental health challenges that require support interventions; and report to their immediate supervisor any situation which they have reasonable justification to believe presents an imminent and serious danger to life or health.

He said he has been washing his hands with soap and urging members of his family to do the same to keep safe from the deadly virus. &quot;I had heard that our metropolis was going to manufacture sanitiser and masks, and distribute them to the city people. I went looking for these things in the market, but there is neither mask nor sanitiser. May be it is only for the sake of publicity,&quot; he said. Rakesh Chitrakar, a resident of Lalitpur Metropolitan City -16, also rued that he too has not been able to get hold of neither face mask nor sanitiser whenever he went to the retail store to buy these items.

&quot;I think this talk of the metropolis itself producing and distributing face masks and sanitiser is only the publicity stunt of the metropolis. I have not been able to get these things in the market. The municipality authorities have not felt the difficulty the locals have been facing in such adverse situation,&quot; he said. He added that the children quite often went out of home to play in the courtyard and it would have been easier had sanitiser been made easily available rather than asking the children to wash their hands with soap every time when there is scarcity of water at home.

Now, I feel that that announcement was only a publicity,&quot; she expressed her annoyance.

&quot;We said we are going to manufacture masks and sanitiser but have not been able to bring the raw materials required for this due to the lockdown.

One could see how difficult it was for the security to check and convince the swarm of people entering into Nepal after they were stranded at border. Similarly, as the people took into isolation broke the boundary and fled the scene, security persons faced tough time to handle the situation. At a time when the police persons are working for people&#39;s safety, how safe they are may be equally pressing issue. In this connection, when this reporter reached a police person on duty on Kathmandu road on Friday, he said, &quot;We&#39;re committed to country&#39;s security and safety. Leadership should think on boosting our morale.&quot; He had no gloves in hand.

The police persons on roads could be seen equipped only with common mask and hand sanitizer for their safety. The Armed Police Force too has the same condition. At such, some have voiced for incentives to boost their morale in the crisis. The police persons below the Inspector level seem more vulnerable, some argue. To this, Deputy Superintendent of Police Bishworaj Pokhrel, who is the Chief of Metropolitan Police Office, Kathmandu, however, said the leadership is aware to keep intact the morale of the police persons. &quot;The high level officers of Nepal Police are also mobilized together, which helps boost the morale of junior staffs.&quot; &quot;All police persons have similar experience. It is our duty to work for security. We need to work in high spirit,&quot; said another police officer.

Moreover, Deputy Superintendent of the Armed Police, Prabin Kumar Shrestha, said teams of armed police were mobilized as per the direction from government and district security committee. Police are in most vulnerable condition, so the security teams are mobilized consisting of few members. Mostly, vehicles are used, and information collection is made more active in view of the vulnerability. He argued that the motivational incentives was essential to motivate the police at such risky situations. It is stated that the security agency has urged the government to manage such allowance following the international practice. Meanwhile, some public are willing to come in the street for fun, the security force has the compulsion in such cases.
