Kathmandu, January 27
After the death of eight Indian tourists at a hotel in Daman of Makawanpur district last week, the Hotel Association Nepal has told its members to completely abide by the government standards introduced for hotels and resorts.
The government has recently issued a new set of rules for hotels and other hospitality facilities. The standards are different for different categories.
Concluding that the Daman-based hotel’s inability to provide air conditioners forced the visitors to use heaters during the nighttime and they caused asphyxiation, the association urged the facilities to implement the standards strictly, though one week after the incident.
Among other provisions, the new rule requires hotels of all levels to provide an air conditioner to each of the rooms.",/business,"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 10:38:50 +0000"

Kathmandu, January 26
Just two weeks after Nepal enthusiastically inaugurated the ambitious Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign with a target of bringing in at least two million foreign tourists in one year, seven people including four foreigns went missing in an avalanche in the Annapurna trekking region.
A few days after that, eight Indian national died of asphyxiation as they switched on a heater to warm the room before going to bead at a poorly equipped hotel in Daman of Makawanpur district, near Kathmandu.
Whereas many have thought these incidents would have an adverse impact on the country’s wish to aggressively promote the tourism industry. Concerned officials and entrepreneurs alike also view that these incidents have become alarms to them.
Rudra Singh Tamang, the spokesperson at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, however, maintains that the government is serious about avoiding such incidents in the future. “There are many works being done to give a message that Nepal is a safe destination.”
The entrepreneurs, however, are more worried. “Such incidents apparently affect tourist arrival. The government’s role should be more active in such situations,” he says.
Meanwhile, some stakeholders view that the absence of the chief executive officer at Nepal Tourism Board would also affect the campaigning. It has been more than one month since the incumbent Deepak Raj Joshi retired, but the government has not been able to find his successor yet.",/business,"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 05:07:34 +0000"

Kathmandu, January 24
The telecommunications regulatory body of the country, Nepal Telecommunications Authority, has directed telephone service providers to decrease the charge they impose on inter-network calls. The directive will come into effect on April 2.
The authority recently issued the Interconnection Guideline requiring the companies to decrease the charge. The authority’s spokesperson and director Min Prasad Aryal says the customers can directly benefit from the new rule. “After it is implemented, companies earn more profit. Based on that, they have to decrease the call tariff.”
Whereas other interconnection charges have been slashed, the guideline has increased the cost of calling a landline number from a mobile phone.
Many international companies have already removed the provision of interconnection charges. The government of Nepal, however, has adopted a policy of gradually phasing it out.",/business,"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 07:34:35 +0000"

Kathmandu, January 24
As many as 20 pilots of the national flag carrier, Nepal Airlines Corporation, have warned of resigning in masse, urging the management to end the discrimination they have been facing.
The pilots have claimed that there is a gap between facilities and services given to them and other foreign pilots recruited by the government-run corporation on contract. They have given the management three months’ time to meet the demand, threatening they would quit otherwise.
The ‘resignation notice’ dated January 17 was registered at the NAC Office of the Executive Chairman on Thursday evening.
“The management is happy in hiring expensive expatriate pilots or pilots on contract with a much higher salary,” the letter reads, “But nothing has been done to replace such expensive pilots with its own in-house pilots or to increase the salary and benefits of its permanent pilots.”
All the disgruntled pilots have been flying international flights of the national flag carrier.
Earlier this week, the executive chairman of the corporation, Madan Kharel had resigned.

Keshav Kumar Sharma, the director-general at the Department of Roads, says the agreement for the loan, however, is yet to be signed formally. After the signing, the government will take initiatives for preparing a detailed project report and designing. It is expected that the design will take around one year.
The 121-km road will be divided into different sections for the ease of expansion. The division is necessary as different parts have different geographical, environmental and ecological conditions and the expansion plan has to be made accordingly, according to Sharma.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kaira-movie-review-an-average-love-story-to-avoid.html,"
With the onset of monsoon, there are a lot of romantic movies being released in Kathmandu. After Romeo and Muna failed to attract the crowd last week, it was the Aryan Sigdel-starrer Kaira that tested its luck at the multiplexes in the Valley and around the country.
The romantic movie revolves around two characters Jay (Aryan Sigdel) and Kaira (Samragee Shah) who accidentally meet at a bar in Kathmandu. In a topsy-turvy journey, both seem to be ‘lucky’ in all matters except for romantic relationships. The story takes a turn when both of them meet in the Philippines where their love story deepens. What happens next changes and both an emotional ride begins.
The first half of the movie was quite engaging with the director showing the audience how the two characters met and the story behind the growth of their friendship. The half was gripping but there seemed to be something missing as the director tried to show a lot of things. Like most Nepali movies, Kaira too didn’t have an element of surprise–the story Was quite predictable.
The second half of the film failed to live up to expectations and lost its audience halfway through. The story got a bit intense and sad but it was over-stretched.

One good thing that stands out in the movie is the acting. It shows how much the actors have worked on getting their role right. Shah is good and so is as Kaira. Her acting is good, especially in the emotional scenes where she’s poised and natural. I didn’t think she Samragyee had it in her to play such an emotional role.
Sigdel, like always, is natural and calm throughout the film. His dialogue delivery, along with his expressions, is good. What is commendable is the flawless chemistry between the duo.
Other actors like Shishir Rana, Hitesh Sharma, Tsuresh Neupane and Marisha Shrestha are not as natural as the main cast but have complimented the two.
What is poor is the script which seems to have been inspired by a lot of Bollywood and Hollywood flicks. The story is quite good and gripping, but the way it has been presented is poor and shows a lack of originality. The screenplay does not do justice to the story which makes it a bit of a drag and makes the audience wish it was over as many left before the film ended. If not for the actors’ hard work, the movie would have been a poor watch as there a lot of faults with the planning of scenes and sequences throughout the film.
The songs are good as they feature a host of good singers such as Sugam Pokharel, Yubraj Chaulagain, Ketan Chhetri and Shreya Sotang. The cinematography is exemplary with Shivaram Shrestha capturing all the beautiful places in the Philippines elegantly. The wardrobe used is quite good too except for a few scenes in which you feel that Sigdel’s dress up is a bit over the top.
Overall, the movie is borderline average. Having expected so much from it, it disappoints.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kaala-movie-review-rajni-steals-the-show.html,"
South Indian movies being screened in a Kathmandu multiplex is a rare site.  Apart from Bahubali, not many have done well when shown to the public. But at a time when Nepali movies aren’t doing good business, bringing Rajnikant starrer Kaala seems like a no brainer.
The movie revolves around Kaala (Rajnikant), the don who rules one of the slums of Mumbai named Dharavi. Due to its central location, many builders want to take over the land and promise the people migrated from Tamil Nadu new houses. But the story takes a turn when Kaala sees the plans of these builders and opposes them. This makes him a prime target of the builders and a local politician Hari Dada (Nana Patekar) who want to eliminate him in order to get the land.
The first half of the movie is engaging and intense. It focuses on how we believe that by destroying, we can develop a case that has been seen here in Nepal too. It shows the hardships of the people who live in the slum. It shows how the people are brainwashed into selling their houses in return for fake promises.
The second half, even though it has a lot of action, is less engaging than the first as the audience can predict most of what is to come. The ending is a bit confusing and could have been better but the movie does end on a positive note giving the audience plenty to think about.

Superstar Rajni is superb like he was in his previous movie Kabali in which he was fighting for the rights of Tamil workers in Malaysia. His acting is natural and has that certain charisma that he has always shown. He has helped the director sell the movie which focuses more on the people of the slum than Rajnikant. But that said, Rajni is flawless, particularly in the action scenes on a fly over in which he rolls back the year and that too in slow motion with an umbrella in hand.
Nana Patekar as Hari Dada, the corrupt politician, is quite superb. He is natural and has played the role of an antagonist with grace. His confrontations with Kaala are terrific to watch, particularly the part in which he refuses to drink water in Kaala’s house.
Zareena (Huma Qureshi) who plays the role of Kaala’s ex-girlfriend and a social worker has also performed very well. Her acting is powerful and the chemistry between her and Rajnikant is worth admiring.
Eeshwari Rao (As Kaala’s wife) and Anjali Patil (As Kaala’s son’s girlfriend), also put in noteworthy performances.
The background score has been well planned and is quite good along with the songs in the movie which have been timed well but could have been a bit short.
The cinematography is brilliant as all action scenes are flawless. George Williams gives the film a polish that makes it very slick.
Kala is a movie that stars Rajnikant, but is not a movie about him or his character. It’s a movie about the people of Dharavi and how they make ends meet by doing manual labour. It’s a story about how the blue coloured people help maintain the city and how the city fails to function without them.
Most Rajini fans might find Kaala a bit dull. But the nearly three-hour film has the potential to grow on those many audacious departures from the norm. Kaala is a film for the people and the fact that Rajnikant is there is just a bonus.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hari-movie-review-this-artistic-experiment-may-not-sell-in-cheesy-market.html,"
For a second week running, Nepali movie lovers have been treated with a movie that producers hardly consider making. Producers normally make movies which are either funny or are full of cheesy love stories because they know that these movies will sell and their investment is safe.
Breaking that trend, filmmakers have come up with a different movie which is sure to give the audience a new experience.
The movie Hari revolves around Bishnu Hari (Bipin Karki), a religious man in his early 30s who lives with his mother Parvati (Sunita Thakur). Hari’s life is pretty laid back as he has no worries, apart from his receding hairline and an oversmart colleague at work. The story takes a turn a bird ‘shits’ on his head, which also brings bad luck to his life.
The first half of the movie establishes Hari as the lead character. It gives the audience an insight into Hari’s monotonous life and his family history. Like the trailer, it’s abrupt and fails to answer many questions. Apart from a few jokes, the half is not very engaging as there is a feel that something big is going to happen in the second half of the film.
The second half though is just a continuation of the slow first half which fails to grab the audience’s attention but does get better with its various twists and turns. The fact that the directors have connected the characters helps the audience make sense of this playlike movie.
Bipin Karki, the star of this movie, had said this movie gave him artistic pleasure and he has done his role justice. He’s almost ever present in all scenes as he has played five roles in the movie, but there are times one feels he has performed better when not being Hari. The movie starts and ends with him and if you’re not his fan, you best not watch the movie.

Over the years, the audience has seen Karki in many roles as he has established himself as a versatile actor. We’ve seen him as Bindu in Chhadke, Bhasme Don in Pashupati Prassad, Pittal in Loot 2 and Goldie Don in Naakaa, but his role in Hari stands out from his previous roles.
Thinley Lhamo in her second Nepali movie has done well. Even though she has no dialogues, her emotions and expressions stand out. Sunita Thakur, who plays Hari’s mother, has given a stellar performance too along with Kamal Mani Nepal, who plays the role of Hari’s adversary naturally.
Safal KC and Pratik Gurung have done a good job with the direction as they have planned out most shots very well and the lighting is particularly noteworthy.
The story, however, could have been better. Although both KC and Gurung have tried to keep the audience hooked, the slow presentation makes it hard not to use the phone time and again.
The cinematography is what keeps the movie alive. Chintanraj Bhandari has captured most scenes very well and there is hardly anything bad one can point out.
Overall the movie is a good watch if one watches it with an open mind. If you’re looking for something entertaining, then there are other movies in the multiplexes you can watch. But if you’re looking to watch a unique Nepali movie with an artistic touch, Hari should definitely be on your list as this is more like play than a movie.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sunkesari-movie-review-predictable-and-boring.html,"
There was a lot of hype surrounding Sunkesari but the movie has failed to live up to that hype mainly because of its poor storyline and script.
Having watched the producers and actors promote the movie so vigorously, many would have thought the movie would change the way people look at Nepali movies. But after watching Sunkesari the audience would have realised that Nepali movies disappoint more often than others.
The ‘horror’ movie is set in a mansion-turned-boutique-hotel in Australia where Sunkesari (Reecha Sharma) goes to take a break from her sad life. Yadav (Rabindra Jha) a housemaid is the only person in the huge mansion which seems to be haunted. Soon Sunkesari is joined by two more guests Rupen (Sunny Dhakal) and Emma (Lauren Lofberg) after which strange paranormal events begin to unfold.
The start of the movie is abrupt, clichéd and fails to give context. The start is decent but the writer and director Arpan Thapa fails to explain what is happening and why it is happening. The first half gradually gets better thanks to Rabindra Jha’s acting but the filmmakers have failed to scare the audience even though they have used loud sounds and spooky background sound.
The second half of the film has been rushed. With a runtime of 1 hour and 30 minutes, the movie fails to explain a number of things such as the background story of Rupen and Sunkesari.

The acting in the movie isn’t that great either. Sharma as Sunkesari is par and has delivered a flat performance. She seems to be lost and her turning into the ghost is so unnatural that it will make you laugh–especially when she ‘levitates’.
The movie introduces a foreign actor Lauren Lofberg who seems to have done a decent job but again the writing doesn’t help her. Thapa doesn’t seem to have thought about how to incorporate a foreign character before writing the film. But Lofberg as a ghost looks good and far more convincing than Sharma is.
Jha as Yadav is the most entertaining character in the film without whom the movie would have been a drag. The rest of the characters are unnatural and lack identity. The two ghost girls are good as they have done justice to their roles.
The cinematography is good along with the location and is the only thing that makes you feel that you’re watching a horror movie. The movie has been shot by both Nepali and foreigners–both seem to have done a good job to make sure the movie gave a spooky feel.
The writing though was poor and cliched as Thapa offers nothing new. He seems to have rushed the movie from start to finish as he fails to explain many plots. There are two songs in the film which are out of place, pointless and extremely unnatural. Maybe watching too many Bollywood horror movies made the director put them in the film.
Overall the movie fails to live up to the expectation. Its predictable and that makes it funny. The people in the hall were extremely disappointed as they expected more. The movie with his impressive promotion might have done well at the box office but its success there will not make the movie great.
There are signs that there will be a sequel but how many will watch it after such a disappointing prequel is a question for the filmmakers to answer.
P.S.: A+ for the effort.

Superhero movies are making money these days. After the success of Black Panther and Avengers Infinity War, Marvel Studios have come up with yet another superhero movie which is sure to tickle all your funny bones thanks to Ryan Reynolds’ superb performance as ‘Deadpool’.
Deadpool 2, like its predecessor, revolves around the story of a foul-mouthed mutant mercenary Wade Wilson aka ‘Deadpool’ (Reynolds) who has lost everything. He tries to bring together a team of fellow mutant rogues to protect a young boy blessed with supernatural abilities from the brutal, time-travelling mutant, Cable. But the story takes a dramatic turn when Cable has a change of heart. The events that follow will surely surprise everyone.
The first instalment of Deadpool didn’t seem to please the critics with its humour and to rectify that, the new movie has a bit more than just humour. The sequel has a better storyline and that makes this movie better than the first one as it shows the other side of the persona of Deadpool.
The story flows from start to finish. There is no confusion and the humour compliments the good storyline. The first movie had a lot of pop culture references which were hard to understand. But this one has better jokes (still inappropriate), which people can relate to. And this one also offers surprising depth and handles the story of the troubled teenage character with grace.
Reynolds as Deadpool is hilarious. It seems like he has learned from his first movie and added something more to his acting than just jokes. He showed that even a troubled superhero like him can have emotions and is particularly good in the second half of the film.

Julian Dennison as Firefist is good and delivers a stellar performance as a tough teenager who’s been dealt a rough hand at an orphanage.
Josh Brolin as a mutant from the future is just as good but if you look at it the movie is all about Reynolds as you can’t take your eye (and ears) off him.
The action scenes are quite brilliant throughout the movie (not that it was any worse in the first movie). Some scenes do look painful and the fact that the censor board hasn’t cut the film too much makes it much better.
For the brilliant action sequences, we can thank director David Leitch who has specialised in action films after his hit movies Atomic Blond and John Wick. You can expect the same hyper-real fantasia of the first film. Leitch and Reynolds (who also contributes as a writer) throw everything at it as they let your imagination wander.
If you liked the first movie, you’ll surely enjoy watching this one as it offers the same humour but on a larger scale.

PS: Don’t miss the post-credits and yea please leave your kids at home!

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/lamphoo-movie-review-boring-presentation-of-a-common-mans-struggle.html,"
Nepali movies are full of surprises. One doesn’t know what to expect from them. The trailers give out very little as one can expect numerous twists and turns while watching one. But Kabir Khadka starrer Lamphoo is a movie that can be judged by its trailer. Like the trailer, the movie is abrupt, haphazard and downright boring.
Lamphoo revolves around Ramesh (Kabir Khadka), a carefree unemployed boy in the town of Kusma. Looking at where he is going, his parents constantly nag him and don’t let him peruse his dream which leaves him frustrated. He is fed up with life and spends with his friends who constantly get him into trouble. But his life changes when he meets Aarati (Mariska Pokhrel) who desperately wants him to change the way he lives life.
But that doesn’t go as planned, as he is tricked by his friends because of whom he has to leave the girl and the town and go to Kathmandu where his life changes drastically when he gets into the trap of selfish people. There are only two ways left for Ramesh, either surrender or fight with them.
The movie starts abruptly. It feels like a few scenes are randomly put together as it lacks proper planning and execution. The first half is extremely long and pretty avoidable. It focuses on Ramesh and his bid to get Aarati to like him which stretches so long the audience stops paying attention and the interval comes as a welcome break.
The long first half results in a confusing second half, which makes one wonder if the filmmakers themselves watched the movie before releasing it. It is full of twists and turns, but that makes the audience scratch their heard wondering what exactly is going on.
The script is poor and has been written by someone who clearly lacks experience. The director hasn’t been helped by the script, but the way he has introduced so many characters in such an abrupt manner makes one question his ability as well.
The actors are average. Khadka is decent as lead but the way he is presented is quite odd and apart from his chemistry with his little brother, there is nothing good to talk about.
Pokharel in the movie is decent, but she could have been better especially while portraying emotions in the film. Her chemistry with Khadka is poor.
Salon Basnet, who is introduced as Lekin in the second half, fails to live up to expectations. He has tried to lighten the mood with his witty acting, but at times goes over the top with his acting. That said, he is the only actor in the movie who has done a good job.
Sanjit Bhandari is poor as Dipak, a rich businessman. His acting is unnatural and his chemistry with Chandani Sharma is quite poor.

The movie also has a special cameo for ‘Tarkariwali’, Kusum Shrestha, whose photo of carrying vegetables had gone viral last year. She doesn’t have a big role and appears in a few shots making it obvious that her name has been used for promotion purposes.
Director Gopal Chandra Lamichhane is particularly off with his direction. He has haphazardly introduced characters and has also failed to explain few plots especially after the climax which seems to have been rushed.  He also randomly adds songs to the movie which is the primary reason that the movie is so long.
The cinematographer is just poor, particularly during the action scenes which have not been planned well. There are a few blurred and shaky shots along with a night shot where one of the characters is barely visible.
Above all, the flow of the script prepared by Bhupati is weak and it is evident that he clearly needs to work on his dialogues if he wants to do well as a scriptwriter. What these writers need to learn is how and where to add English into a Nepali film. The use of English in this movie is odd and very unnatural.
The only saving grace are the songs which are quite nice and are doing well but their placement in the film is out of place.
To sum up, the movie is not worth a watch. It’s a movie that will give aspiring actors a hope that even they can someday make it in this industry which doesn’t seem to be evolving.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/damaru-ko-dandibiyo-movie-review-remembering-the-forgotten-sport.html,"
 
Nepali movies these days have a similar storyline that revolves around money. If it isn’t about money, it is about mimicking films made in India or abroad. Most of the producers fear of losing money–no one wants to think outside the box and break the trend.
However, once in a while a movie comes along to challenge this. Damaru Ko Dandibiyo, which was released across Nepal on Friday, is one movie that brings in a gust of fresh air into the cinema industry.
Damaru ko Dandibiyo revolves around the forgotten sport of dandibiyo. Damaru (Khagendra Lamichhane) returns to his village with an aim to revive dandibiyo. But his father, once a reputed dandibiyo player, opposes him and tells him to concentrate on his career.
Damaru is left with no option but to defeat his father in a dandibiyo match to pursue his dream. But that doesn’t go to plan as his father defeats him and in the match and he leaves the village thinking it’s better to quit.
Damaru ko Dandibiyo is directed by Chhetan Gurung–this is his debut movie. Both the writer (Lamichhane) and the director have done a stellar job in showing the audience what ‘the lost sport’ is about. The strong script keeps the audience engaged and the tone in which the movie is shot compliments the script.
The first half of the film teaches the audience about dandibiyo and its rules. The second half was equally good and engaging as all those present in the hall wanted to know if Damaru would revive the sport or not.
All the actors have given stellar performances. Lamichhane, in the lead role, comes out with his best. His natural acting throughout the film makes him stand out from the rest of the cast.

Along with Lamichhane, Anup Baral who plays the role of Damaru’s father is equally good. His seriousness in the first half of the film is worth admiring as well as his role as coach in the second half.
Menuka Pradhan gives a powerful performance as Mala. She was particularly good in the emotional scenes where the rest of the cast were a bit weak. But the lack of chemistry between her and Lamichhane was visible. Supporting actor Buddhi Tamang is his natural self and has given another decent performance along with Ashant Sharma and Laxmi Bardewa who have done justice to their respective roles.
The background scores and the music in the film are good and they do not feel out of place. The cinematography is simple as the cinematographer has captured all scenes well, especially the dandibiyo matches that take place in the second half.
To sum it up, the movie is a worth a watch. It’s quite disheartening that more movies like these aren’t being made. The movie informs the audience about the country’s de facto national sport. Maybe this movie will encourage youngsters to take up the sport.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kohalpur-express-movie-review-a-cheap-copy-of-mumbai-express.html,"
A recent trend in the Nepali film industry: rope in a group of well-known actors and give them funny roles to play. The reason: people will come watch the movie no matter how boring it may be. Kohalpur Express–I’m not surprised–does not buck the trend, even at the cost of creativity and presentation.
The story begins with SP (Buddhi Tamang), Krishna (Binod Neupane) and Salo Keto planning to kidnap (Rabindra Jha) Agrawal’s son. The mastermind behind this kidnapping is an expecting mother Champa (Priyanka Karki) who wants to have a happy life. She believes that looting a rich and corrupt man is the only way to do it without trampling on her ‘morals’.
But the story takes a turn when kidnappers SP, Krishna and Salo Keto get injured and Kohalpur Express (Keki Adhikari) has to kidnap the kid. However, all goes horribly wrong after she not only picks up the wrong kid, but also loses the ransom money.
Initially, you think the movie is quite nice. But when you realise the movie is an adaptation of the Kamal Hassan-starer Mumbai Express, the movie loses its appeal. Apart from a handful of sequences and dialogues, the movie offers nothing different. It revolves around the same narrative Nepali films normally play around money.
Keki Adhikari, also the producer of the film, has done a decent job as she plays the role of a woman who has difficulty hearing–she can do no wrong. But that said, she has no proper emotions in the movie and is always serious.
Karki is good as usual but her role of an angry pregnant woman is not as good it could have done. At times you wonder: Why is she is always mad? But her chemistry with Tamang does look genuine, unlike her ridiculously large belly.
Tamang doesn’t have a huge role but he makes you laugh with his usual witty dialogues. He is slowly becoming the Brahmanandam Kanneganti of Nepali movies.
Reecha Sharma is just odd. Her role of Agrawal’s second wife is awkward and she is too loud most of the times and overdoes things with her expressions.
The other actors are bearable. Child actor Kushagra Bhattarai gives a good performance but needs to work on his emotions in the future. Neupane, in a different role, has done quite well and pulled off the role of a stammerer with grace.

The script and screenplay are more than just an adaptation of Mumbai Express, so there’s not a lot one can talk about them. The positive aspect of the movie is that the writer has keeps the suspense under the wraps pretty effectively. The cinematography is quite good like all movies being made these days.
The music is not so great. The song ‘C-O-W Cow’ has received over 8 million views on YouTube. All other songs in the film are a just there to prolong the runtime.
The background score given by Rohit Shakya is good, especially the title song.

Multiplexes in Kathmandu are screening yet another romantic movie this week, the much-awaited Lily Bily. The movie starring popular actor Pradeep Khadka and debutante Jasita Gurung has been directed by Milan Chams.
This ‘rom-com’ revolves around the story of two characters Avash (Pradeep Khadka) and Shruti(Jasita Guring) who meet at a restroom at a cinema hall in Scotland. Both come from different family backgrounds–with their own baggage of emotions. During an unusual and interesting journey, they start to look for their soul mate inside one another before falling in love. But the story takes a turn when they find out the truth about one another.
The first half of the movie is avoidable and lacks substance and good writing. The start is abrupt as the movie loses the audience in the first half itself. The dialogues are clichéd and the sound is poorly dubbed.
The first half ends on a cliffhanger–it is the only reason people stick around to watch the movie. The story in the second half gets better, but again clichéd dialogues and screenplay leaves many in the hall restless and bored.
Pradeep Khadka has tried to do his best in a movie which he should never have signed up for. Rather than playing similar type of movies, he should have tried different roles to showed his versatility. But he had a movie to forget.

Jasita Gurung is below par and had a debut to forget. Her lack of experience in the field was the reason for such a mediocre performance–something the director must have noticed while shooting. All she does in the movie is cry from start to finish and brings nothing new to the table as she gives a flat performance.
Priyanka Karki does her best in a short cameo and the gulf in class and experience between her and Gurung os glaring. Anoop Bikram Shahi can be seen in a negative role again, but again his role was so short that nothing can be made of it.
The reason the actors were bad has to be the story. It plays on the same of narrative that we’ve been watching for decades. The writer of the film hasn’t tried anything different and has been lazy with both the dialogues and the screenplay. The only thing that makes it different is that it’s been shot in a foreign land.
The cinematography could have been better. Most of the film was shot in Scotland, which is an extremely picturesque and they have shown that. But it could have been done by literally anyone. There are times when the shot jump from one place to another without explaining why.
When it comes to romantic movies, at least the songs are good, but it’s not the case when it comes to Llily Bily. The songs aren’t any good and the choreography is just avoidable.
To sum it up, the movie doesn’t leave a good impression. One thing can be learned from the film: Shooting a flick in a foreign location doesn’t make it better. There are a lot of factors that make a movie great and this movie does not have any of it.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/timi-sanga-movie-review-cliched-tale-of-friendship-love-and-sacrifice.html,"The story revolves around three characters, all from different walks of life destined to travel together. Niti (Samragyee RL Shah) is an NRN visiting Nepal for the first time and she meets Shuvam (Aakash Shrestha). He is her guide for her trek to Poon Hill. Bharat Raj Mishra (Najir Husen), an unusual trekker from Terai with his own personal mission, meets Niti and Shuvam on the way. During their journey, they go through unexpected love and emotions with each other.
Beginning of the movie Timi Sanga along with the first half is enjoyable as romantic comedies generally are; but there is a feeling that the director got carried away in the second half and stretched it too long. The actors have done a steady job trying to connect with the audience, but they fail to materialise in the second half of the film. One could sense what was coming because the second half of the movie plays on a similar narrative old Hindi movies used to play with corny dialogues in the forefront of it all.
The actors have done a decent job in the film. Fan favourite Samragyee Shah looks to be in her zone playing the role of an NRN. Acting as the lead in her third film, she has come a long way since her debut movie Dreams. Her attitude stands out in the film along with her acting in some of the emotional scenes.
Najir Hussain like always is brilliant with his witty acting and powerful dialogue delivery. One can’t help but feel that without him and his constant jokes, the movie would have been difficult to watch.

Acting in his second film, Aakash Shrestha also looks in his zone as his chemistry with Shah stands out. But there are times his inexperience shows especially during some emotional scenes. That said he also needs to dance better if he wasn’t to be a versatile actor.
The actors, however, have been let down by a poor script. The storyline has been thought of well but the dialogues are not as good. Some are witty and makes you laugh but most are frail and uninspired.
The film is over two hours long thanks to a number of songs, most of which are futile and drag the movie making the audience restless. The song ‘Man Ma Ago’ was needless and maybe would have been popular a few decades ago. Romantic movies do need songs but apart from ‘Ladyo Ladyo’. The rest of them are below average along with the background scores.
The cinematography is good given it was shot in such picturesque destination around the Annapurnas. However, they have done nothing new in the film and one can notice ‘grains’ during some night shots which makes it clear that the director didn’t give enough attention to details. Along with that, dubbing is equally bad as the audio isn’t in sync with the visuals.
Influenced by romantic Bollywood films, the movie isn’t a bad watch. The story is good and is engaging thanks to some fine acting by the cast. But with better planning and a shorter script, it could have been much better.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/high-energy-consumption-should-not-be-discouraged-now-ghising.html,"NEA Managing Director Kulman Ghising
Nepal Electricity Authority’s Managing Director Kul Man Ghising is retiring in a few months. When he was promoted to the position in 2016, the country was in a severe power crisis. Nepalis had to endure up to 18 hours of load-shedding every day. However, the regular power outage is a once-upon-a-time story now. Rather, Ghising’s team in the authority is currently advocating for increased energy consumption in Nepal, claiming the country will see more hydropower projects in the next few years.
Onlinekhabar’s Rabindra Ghimire recently talked to Ghising about why he is promoting energy consumption though the country still imports electricity from India.
Excerpts:
Media reports claim that the NEA is in a comfortable position regarding the balance between energy demand and supply. Are you really confident about the company’s capacity to meet the demand?
Let me clarify the confusion first. Some media reports have said that demand is on a steady decline, but it is not true. Every year, the demand falls in October and November, mainly due to two reasons. The first: this period is one of transition–there is not much heat in the southern plains, neither there’s too much cold in the mountains. That’s why consumers don’t operate appliances such as heaters and fans that require heavy load. Besides, there are many festivals such as Dashain, Tihar, Chhath and Bishwakarma Puja. Factories close their operations for such festivals and demand significantly dips.
This is the usual trend. But definitely demand has slightly increased this time, so has the availability of power. The peak demand has not increased above 1,300 megawatt, which is good. Likewise, to maintain balance, many projects are underway to enhance energy efficiency whereas we have run a successful programme to control pilferage.
Daily load management is difficult because the demand amount differs every hour. Currently, our power generation capacity is around 1,200 megawatts, at least during the five months of the monsoon. This year, we also exported around 200-megawatt energy to Bihar because the generation exceeded the demand.
In the monsoon season, we do not need to import energy. Now, the monsoon is over most of our run-of-the-river projects are generating power below par. Hence, we are importing energy for peak hours. However, it is very nominal in comparison to the past. Till April-May next year, the import amount will increase as our production capacity continues decreasing–this has been the trend for every dry season. Despite that, we estimate that the amount of imported power will be less than that of last year.
On the other hand, we are completing some new transmission lines so that we can import power whenever we wish. They will also enable us to enter the Indian energy market for trading. We hope to produce an additional 1,000-megawatt energy by June-July the next year. It means we have to export at least 500 to 600-megawatt power in the monsoon. We are discussing how we can become more efficient in the Indian market next monsoon.
In the winter season, however, we do not have that flexibility. Nonetheless, we have to increase consumption in the domestic market. It means we have to increase the capacity of our distribution systems, substations, transmission lines. We also need to expand the scope of power consumption, for example to cooking. We are studying all these issues.
We believe that a certain volume of energy, at least 15 to 20 per cent of the demand, should remain on reserve. We are planning to convert the Indian grid as the reserve margin for us when Nepal is self-reliant to meet the demand. Likewise, our export to India can be a reserve margin for them.
NEA Managing Director Kul Man Ghising
Do you think replacing cooking gas is possible immediately?
Yes, it is possible. Of course, we are still importing energy during the dry season. But, we are also selling it during the monsoon, at a competitive price. If importing helps us improve our economy, we should not consider it negatively.
The government should introduce a demand stimulation plan. It will address the need for increasing domestic demand and adjusting the tariff structure. The current tariff structure discourages high consumption, but it should not be discouraged now.
However, we are clear that we should not change the tariff for the families which use the least amount of electricity every month–power is a lifeline for them. There are more than 1.2 million customers who pay Rs 3 for one unit of electricity. But at the next level, for the middle-class and upper-class people, the amount of consumption and the tariff rate should be inversely proportional–the more they consume, the lower the rate they are charged.
Likewise, we are thinking of using smart metres, which calculate different rates for different times of a day, for example, power goes quite expensive during peak hours. Such technology also helps us maintain balance. We can also calculate the tariff differently for different seasons, for example, it should be cheap in the monsoon.
You are thinking of imposing a higher rate for the customers who use less energy. But recently, a report has claimed Nepal’s electricity is the most expensive in South Asia already. 
I don’t accept that our energy is the most expensive in South Asia. You cannot compare us with Bhutan because it has so much surplus amount and has earned a lot by exporting energy to India. Consequently, people get power at subsidised rates. I don’t think you can compare Nepal with Bangladesh also because it also has so many subsidised schemes. India has different rates for different districts; but, overall, the rate is higher.
Our energy is not expensive. The current tariff is not benefitting us; it is just enough to maintain a breakeven. The amount that we earned in profit recently comes from other sources like interests paid by the projects of our investments. The tariff does not contribute to our profit.
Apparently, we should sell it at a higher rate than our purchase. Our average cost price is Rs 7.5 per unit, but we are selling it for Rs 3 to 5, not only for the lower-class domestic consumers.  Industrial enterprises are using power for Rs 4.15 per unit during nighttime. On average, a factory in Birgunj pays Rs 7.64 per unit; we buy it from Bihar at the rate of Rs 10 whereas domestic hydropower projects have different rates, as much as Rs 15.
Do you think the authority is ready for some subsidy schemes like in other countries if the government wants?
Rather than subsidies, we are working for a scientific tariff that will increase our demand, meet our revenue target and make the energy cheaper in the long run. We have a plan for that.
You said the current tariff is already enough to maintain a breakeven for the company. So why are you looking for increasing the revenue target? As a government authority, you are not supposed to earn any profit.
We have assets worth Rs 400 billion, but we are in debt of Rs 200 billion. We have to pay for its interest regularly. Also, look at our long-term liability. We have around 12,000 staff; of them, around 6,000 are entitled to the pension for the entire life.
If the authority is stronger, it can invest in other projects. It can build new hydro projects. There are costs involved in the maintenance of substations and other infrastructures. I agree that we should not look for any big profit like a private company, but we need profit at a certain level so that we can also catch any reinvestment opportunities.
We are not distributing our profit to the staff; we are investing it for people. If we had earned a profit of Rs 20 billion, the authority could have built the Budhi Gandaki project on its own. That would have been another benefit for the country and its people.
When the authority grows self-sustained, the government can channelise its money that it earlier used to give to the authority to other sectors like education, health, and roads.",/interview,"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 07:06:02 +0000"

Broughton Coburn of Wilson, Wyoming has worked in conservation and development projects in Nepal, Tibet and India for the four decades, for a variety of international agencies. In Nepal, he worked for the establishment of the Annapurna Area Conservation Project (ACAP), which attracts thousands of tourists, domestic and foreign, every year.
Ahead of the government’s ambitious Visit Nepal Year 2020, Coburn recently spoke to  Onlinkhabar about his time in ACAP and how conservation areas in Nepal are facing an uncertain future.
Excerpts:
How did you get into ACAP?
I came to Nepal as a Peace Corps volunteer and was posted in Syangja, where I lived with an elderly Gurung woman, and wrote two books about her life.  Then I got the chance to work with the Agriculture Department’s Division of Soil Science on a USAID-funded project in which we explored the potential for biogas (gobar gas). I played a small role in that, but am proud to say that there are nearly 200,000 operating, self-sustaining gobar gas plants in Nepal, now. I also worked with UNESCO in Sagarmatha National Park.
What were your first works in conservation?
I became associated with King Mahendra’s Trust for Nature Conservation (later renamed the National Trust for Nature Conservation), and ACAP was one of their lead projects. This ambitious effort resulted in Nepal’s first “conservation areas”, and was gazetted in 1988.  Again, I played a small role, and need to give a big shout out to Dr. Hemanta Raj Mishra, Dr. Chandra Prasad Gurung, and Dr. Mingma Norbu Sherpa. Chandra and Mingma and I toured the Annapurna region, gathering information and speaking with villagers and village leaders. We then started looking at various development plans and objectives. Tragically, Chandra and Mingma were killed in the devastating helicopter crash in the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area a number of years ago.
Looking at it now, aren’t you disappointed that it doesn’t run with the same values as it did back then?
I would say that as ACAP has grown, it has become a bit bureaucratic, and is not operating at the same level of motivation and energy it once had.  But this can happen as any organization grows and matures, and eventually ages.  Perhaps it is time to re-design or re-configure it, to address the changing economic and environmental situations in Nepal — and breathe new life into it?
What are the major challenges for an organisation like these?
Well, the major challenges I see concern growth and development. I believe growth is outpacing ACAP and other conservation areas’ abilities to manage the resources in a sustainable manner. More specifically, the Act and regulations underpinning ACAP expire on January 17, 2020.  I’m not sure that ACAP staff are entirely certain what will happen next. But with careful planning they can hopefully re-configure an ACAP that will re-engage conservation productively and strive to achieve the project’s original goals.

Is the area too big? Can it not be broken down so works can be done more effectively?
I personally feel that ACAP might be too big, and that it has potential for being redefined and restructured. Maybe we were too ambitious in the 1980s in drawing such large boundaries. I wonder if some of the villages along ACAP’s southern border areas would necessarily need to be included a slimmed-down, re-designed protected area, one that focuses more on core management zones that are enduring the heaviest impact from tourism and development.  But there are likely political considerations involved, and this adjustment may be difficult to propose. Especially in Dr. Chandra’s and Dr. Mingma’s absence, and in the spirit of their tireless work, I have offered to help ACAP in whatever limited way I can with the future design process. I see great potential for re-formulating an exciting new ACAP.
Is money also a problem? No one wants to give up on it.
Well, that is one of the problems. No one wants to give up the ACAP royalty revenue stream, so there are likely to be some political tussles with that.
What about the roads? Are they affecting the conservation areas?
It’s discouraging that ACAP (and MCAP, where I was recently) do not have the power to enforce the commissioning of environmental impact assessments for the roads that are penetrating even the most remote corners. From what I’ve gathered, those who propose EIAs, or raise questions about road approval and alignment, are regarded as anti-development. ACAP gets this accusation whenever they raise questions. Conducting the EIA and enforcing the recommendations is part of their mission, along with overseeing and monitoring the environmental standards of the roads that are coming into ACAP and MCAP.
Trekkers complain that the motor road has killed the trails. Do you feel so?
Along some sections of the “alternate” trek routes — the trails that typically bypass the road or travel on the opposite bank of the river — trekking can be tricky or dangerous. Himalayan rivers are prone to landslides, and if slides take out a road, every effort will be made to clear it.  But typically trail maintenance budgets are inadequate to clear large landslides that don’t impact a motor road. After some years, the alternate trekking routes may become unpassableas where they encounter deep landslide scars.
Your thoughts on conservation area projects in general?
I recently visited the Manaslu Conservation Area (MCAP).  As someone involved in the early stages of ACAP, I was disappointed to see virtually no rangers patrolling in the higher elevation areas, and lack of management is evident. If there is an intention to follow the mission of providing for sustainable development, alongside the goal of preserving the environment, I feel there will need to be more attention applied to the environmental and conservation side of the equation.
Why do you think that’s the case? These places get thousands of tourists every year who pay a lot to get in. Yet the area is polluted and the trails are bad. Have they been following conservation ethics?
These questions should be posed to the NTNC, ACAP and MCAP.  They have established the Conservation Area Management Committees (CAMCs), which are doing a good job in many areas, and they have received support from the Hariyo Ban Project, but in some areas environmental protection efforts have been inadequate.
I sense that they’re interested largely in the revenue that tourists bring in. Our group of nine people recently paid $1,900 in permit fees to the NTNC.  I would like to ask where the money goes and how it is used.
Could you share some incidents that you saw there, in MCAP?
I saw an employee working for a new lodge above Samdo run down to the river with a bag of garbage — plastic bottles, tin cans, papers — and dump it all directly into the river, sending it downstream. I had a talk with the lodge manager, who said that “it’s just the way it is.”
And near Bimthang (ACAP side of the Larkya La), I saw uncontrolled goat and sheep grazing. Arguably, goats, which are very destructive, don’t belong in a pristine, bio-diverse protected area. The farmer told me that he doesn’t pay any fee to ACAP, and that there is no restriction on goat grazing.  In landslide-prone areas, small livestock can also trigger landslides, and our group had to dodge falling rocks triggered by grazing goats.
By the way, what brings you back to Nepal?
Every other year or so, I return to visit the Manaslu Conservation Area Project, partly because we have an adopted son who is from the area, so I am keen to follow the socio-economic changes and developments, and to observe livestock management and agricultural techniques.  Of course, the advent of a motor road into the area will have a transformative effect on the valley.",/interview,"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 04:45:06 +0000"

Paras Khadka, who stepped down as captain of the national cricket team, is not playing the series against MCC. However, Khadka, who is preparing to go to Dubai to play the T-10 league, is ever-present at the TU Cricket Ground to cheer up his teammates.
On Wednesday, Onlinekhabar’s Raj Kumar Shrestha caught up with Khadka and spoke to him about why he didn’t play this series, his aspiration in the T-10 league and his future plans. Excerpts:
The team you’ve captained for a decade is playing right now but you’re not a part of it. How does it feel to watch the team from the stands? 
When I resigned I had said that I wanted a break from international cricket. That is why I’m not playing. But as a player, it doesn’t feel great to not be playing. If you talk to any player, they will tell you that they want to be playing. When you play, the feeling is different from that when you are on the sidelines. But I’m enjoying watching our boys play in whites. It’s been a while since Nepal played three-day cricket, which in itself is good for us going forward.
Don’t you think the team needs you during this transition phase? Why aren’t you playing? 
I’d asked the management to not put my name in the T-20 and three-day squad. However, I did want to play in the 50-over match. Sadly, due to health reasons, I could not play in that one.
So you’re disappointed no to play?
I wouldn’t say disappointed. It’s just part of a cricketer’s life, to be honest. You’ll obviously miss some games in your career. As I missed out, someone else has got a chance to play for Nepal so I wouldn’t stay I am disappointed.
After this, you’re going to Dubai to play the T-10 league. Is it a coincidence that you were selected to take part in the league after you resigned as captain? 
Well, you have to call it a coincidence. I think I received an offer to play the T-10 league five days after I resigned as captain. When the approach was first made, I was quite unsure. I consulted with family, friends, and coaches who told me that it’s a great opportunity and that I should go play.
I had decided to take a break from cricket as a whole, but coaches told me that this was too big an opportunity to miss out on. It’s funny that I left one thing and got something back in return. But as I said, this is just a coincidence.
I’m looking forward to it as well. I want to play and prove to the team that I can do well in the competition. I will be representing Nepal in the league and if I do will it can open doors for other cricketers as well.
Personally, what is your view on T-10 league? 
Well, this is new to me. As a player, you want to play in these global franchise leagues. I’ve got an opportunity and I feel lucky to have got it. It’s a different format and I’m excited. I hope I can justify my team buying me. But that said, I think I’ll play the way that I always play – giving 100 per cent. It’s a good opportunity and I hope more Nepali cricketers will get this opportunity.
Is this the beginning of Paras Khadka’s international franchise career? 
As it’s the first time I’ll be playing international franchise cricket, you can call it the beginning.

Are you hopeful that this will open the door to popular T-20 leagues like IPL, BBL CPL?
That will depend on my performance. I know Nepali cricket fans want players like me to play in these league but it depends on my performances. If you do well, international cricket will recognise you. Which is why my aim is to play good cricket.
Some have been saying that these franchise leagues were not your priority when you were captain. Is that true? 
I feel playing international T-20 leagues like IPL, CPL, and BBL is every cricketer’s dream. Me being captain does not affect that dream I think. But I will say that as a captain you have to think about a lot of things. I’ve tried my best to do what is good for Nepali cricket. Some decisions that I’ve made have been correct and similarly, I have also made some bad decisions.
What feel is right now I can just concentrate on playing cricket and playing well. I have nothing else to worry about and I guess that is going to be fun. Cricket is something that will stay with me for life. I will not be able to go away from it. The best thing for me is the ball hitting the middle of my bat. I want to play cricket. I have no other agenda right now. But I do feel a bit relieved as I am no longer the captain.
Had you wished to be part of the IPL or other leagues for that matter? 
I’d say yes. But if you ask this to any cricketer they will say yes. I wouldn’t just say IPL. No cricketer would say no if you asked him to play in a franchise league. What I feel sad about is we have only been able to play one world cup. We have failed to qualify for the ODI World Cup and have missed out on 2/3 T-20 World Cups. Had we played in these tournaments, we would have had more exposure. I guess it would have opened the door for more competitions. That said, I do feel we can play in these tournaments in the future. I think we are more than capable. But for that, all of us need to come together.
Do you think your performances in Singapore was the reason for your selection in the T-10 league? 
Maybe. Because in cricket they say one catch can change a match and one innings can change a career. Maybe that 100 in Singapore is that innings for me.
Are you talking to Pakistan Super League and other leagues as well? 
I’ve sent my name for the PSL draft. But I don’t know if I’ll be selected. Let’s see what happens. People were asking me if I will play in the Emerging Nations or the T-10. I do feel the country should always come first, but I had already committed to play the T-10 league. I asked our coach Umesh Patwal if it was fine with me playing in the T-10 league and he told me to go. He told me that young players will be given a change instead of me which is why I decided to go to Dubai. But in the future, if the choice is between country and franchise team, I’ll always choose the country.
As you said, one inning can change a player’s career. Can we expect such an inning during the T-10 league? 
I cannot guarantee anything like that. But that said, I will try. In this sport, as you play along you get to create records. For me what’s important is that the team wins.",/interview,"Thu, 07 Nov 2019 09:57:18 +0000"

Onlinekhabar’s Abhaya Raj Joshi talked to Niraula recently on his company’s work and the way forward for solar power in Nepal, Excerpts:
Let’s start the interview talking about some global issues. The Chinese government recently made some policy changes to slash financial aid to developers after Chinese companies overshot targets. How has this affected your business? In Nepal, most of the PVs are imported from China.
As we all know is the world’s major solar PV producer and the demand and supply in the Chinese market affect markets worldwide, including that in Nepal. The policy change comes at an important time. There was a time when solar power cost around 50-60 cent per watt. But after the Chinese policy change, it dropped to 20-30 cents per watt. Before the price drop, solar was considered as an alternative source of power because of its price. But now we are past the price point where solar power can compete with other power sources. Thanks to the drop in prices, Gham Power can now offer power to its customers at a rate cheaper than that of the government grid. So if we look at the cost involved, it has hit the right price point for us to develop ourselves as an energy service company.
If the policy change had not come, what would have happened?  
Solar PV prices have been falling for a long time and any other trigger would have also done the job. But the Chinese policy made it quicker. I believe that it would have eventually happened. When we started our business, people were using diesel generators as back up for power because the state utility could not supply reliable power. Back then also, solar power asaback-up was cheaper compared to diesel. But it was not considered a mainstream source of power. That is why we chose to go to places where access to grid power was limited to geographical reasons. We built micro-grids in areas where bringing grip power was costlier than setting up solar plants. But with the drop in prices and the restored stability in the grid, the commercial market soon began to look feasible for us.
One big criticism labeled against solar power is that it is not reliable. It depends on the amount of sunshine available.
This is the case with all the renewable energy sources. The amount of solar radiation and wind available to us is not under our control. Same is the case with hydro. The power output is directly related with the water available during different seasons. I think the bigger question most certainly is — how you devise strategies to integrate these intermittent energy sources into the grid which also has a variable demand. Digitisation and storage technology could play a bigger role there.
In the past, Nepal Electricity Authority was considered the sole provider of electricity in the country. But these days, companies such as Gham Power are also providing electricity. How does that work?
Until now, we have developed around 2-3 projects under the model we developed to provide cheaper power (compared to the grid) in urban areas. This model is a bit investment-intensive. We need to seek investors to put their money on such projects. This is a problem we’ll talk about later on.
But what we do is make the model feasible for the customer. We talk to potential clients, look at their roof space, their electricity bill, load profile and calculate the potential power that can be generated using solar PVs. At the moment, we only talk about offsetting the consumers’ dependence on grid electricity by using solar power. When the client signs up with us, they don’t need to pay anything for the solar plant; they pay a certain fee per unit of electricity they receive from our solar plant and after 15 years they get to own the entire system. They no longer have to pay us. As the system works for around 25-30 years, the customers get free power for around 15 years.
We are bearing all the risk and the cost associated with the project that’s why we are keen only on at least 50-100 KW projects. The downside is that if the grid becomes unstable again, we have to think about storage. But what we do is we design the installed capacity of our system to be lower than the actual consumption, so that we don’t have to sell excess power to the grid.
We talked about the fall in PV prices, but what about the batteries? Is that why your project model focuses on day-time offsetting rather than night? 
To some extent yes. If you look at our nation’s peak demand, it occurs during the evening when solar production is not at it’s maximum. So, you eventually have to look at storage as an important part of integrating solar into the grid. But, in Nepal, the battery is still expensive. The tax incentives are still not there so just from an economic standpoint it might not make sense right not if you were to invest in batteries alone.
But, on a positive note, if you look at the international market, the price of batteries is also falling. There is great R&D work being done all over the world and we expect it to drop much more. In the very near future, I fully expect batteries to become a part of our grid and they would help provide much needed stability to the grid.
There was a time when the price of the PV was so high that it did not make economic sense to talk about it in a country where hydro has been the most popular source of energy. But now that the prices have fallen, what are some of the challenges you face in developing solar power projects?
That’s true. A few years ago, when the solar prices were high it was viewed more as an “alternative” source of energy. Either to provide power to remote communities, to have a reliable back-up during loadshedding or to displace diesel. Now when you talk about solar, you can actually start to talk about it in purely economic terms, because it can easily be cheaper than the grid and help you reduce your energy costs. But, for solar to really take off there are multiple challenges especially regulatory that need to be addressed.
First, it seems that government policy and laws related to energy, are framed with only hydropower in mind. Almost all the documentation that you need to submit to the authorities are hydro-related. For example, the EIA requirements of a hydropower plant and a solar plant are inherently different, but they need to have a similar structure. There is no consideration given for distributed solar which can be built on rooftops. So, the legalities around how approvals can be obtained for such projects are a bit vague.
Is finance a problem for companies like Ghampower? 
Yes, it is. Financing solar power projects from a local bank still requires personal guarantees from project promoters despite which this can still be quite a lengthy process.  In this case, companies like Ghampower which do not have the funds to perpetually bank-roll these projects struggle to develop a large portfolio..
The other issue with finance is that foreign direct investment proposals take at least 6-9 months to receive government approval. The threshold of foreign investment has been raised to 5 crore per tranche, which can be hard to obtain for a nascent market. Raising debt into SME’s from commercial foreign investors has also been barred. So, there have been instances where we have had to ask our sales team to actually reduce the size of project that we execute. For example – there was one instance where our client was intent on installing 500 kW of solar, but we had to reduce the size of the project to 200 kW.
Despite the tremendous potential the market holds, these policy bottlenecks have really slowed our path to scale. But, I am very hopeful that with the recently suggested amendments to the Electricity Act and the Foreign Investment Act will allow us to tap into this huge market and deploy cheap, reliable solar power at scale.
How does solar compete with hydro these days?
The beauty of solar is that it is very demand-driven. If you need 10 kw you set-up a 10 kw plant. The installation time is minimal and you can set it up on your roof, however much you need it. And guess what, it can be cheaper than what you are paying for the grid electricity.
Hydropower is definitely going to be the mainstay of energy generation in Nepal for the foreseeable future, and the fact that the National grid is so reliable has actually allowed us to set up these grid connected solar systems. So, in our case solar and hydro are not competing but are complementary to each other.
Distributed solar can help reduce the burden on the distribution infrastructure and bring massive monetary savings in terms of reduced losses and reduction in investment cost towards upgrading of the distribution infrastructure. With the increased electricity consumption planned through Electric vehicles and clean cooking, distributed solar will have a big role to play in allowing the utility to manage this demand. Digitisation is key in managing these distributed systems and creating a more robust grid in the country.
What is your take on the future of the energy market globally?
It’s going to be decentralised, it’s going to renewable and it will be digital. Storage and infrastructure will remain the key.
And for Nepal?
I see solar massive potential. Within a few years solar PVs will be a common sight on all houses in Kathmandu. What we need to do is get all the stakeholders together and focus on building the right policies for the future.

Wolfgang Nairz is a renowned mountaineer and the leader of Austria’s 1978 Everest expedition, in which Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler reached the top of Everest without bottled oxygen.
Nairz first came to Nepal in 1970 and since then has been coming to Nepal on a regular basis. Last week, Nairz arrived in Nepal for the 100th time, becoming probably the first foreigner to do so. Upon arrival, his hosts and fans gave him a ‘hero’s welcome’ at the Kathmandu airport and took him to Thamel on a traditional carriage (baggi). Later, Nairz spoke to Onlinekhabar about his impression of Nepal, how things have changed here and about his projects in the country. Excerpts: 
How does it feel to come to Nepal for the 100th time? 
It doesn’t feel any different actually. It feels like coming back home. It has nearly been 50 years since I came to Nepal for the first time, but the joy I get coming to this country is the same. Initially, I was interested in the mountains, but now I also come for the culture and the people. We have a lot of projects here.
What brings you back every time? 
Well, it has to be people. Over the past 50 years, I’ve met a lot of good people. Along with the people, I’d also say the landscape and the culture and religion. I’d say a harmony between the three.
You came to Thamel riding on a carriage all the way from the airport. How was that feeling?
Incredible. I have some great friends here who have given me a terrific reception on my 100th visit to Nepal. They had told me they were not there, but then everyone was at the airport. It was a great surprise, the one I will never forget. The streets were clean, flowers everywhere. It’s like they had done it not for the Chinese President, but for me.
Nairz riding towards Marsyandi Hotel in Thamel on a carriage arranged for him by his friends.
How have things changed since you first came to now?
A lot has changed. I don’t think you can even imagine how things were during those times. There were only three or four big hotels; others were only small guest houses. We rode only bicycles as there were hardly any cars on the roads. We used to go to Bouddha, Patan and other areas on our bicycles. It was really a different time.
Kathmandu has changed the most. It was much calmer. Now it’s a bit wild. I remember we had to carry our own bags off the plane before going to the immigration office. I’d say the change in Kathmandu is negative. However, the changes in the remote areas have been positive. I think that is all thanks to tourism. It’s helped develop areas like Namche into something better.
How would you describe your Everest expedition in 1978?
I’d say it was difficult. Things are a lot easy now. Back then we had to do a lot of work. When I reached the top of Everest, only 60 climbers had reached the top so you could imagine how tough it was. But we had a good team which had Reinhold Messner among others and I think we did a fairly good job. We had no icefall doctors so we had to fix ropes and also prepare camps. It was not as easy as people have it now. We also did not have communication with the outside world. Any source of communication had to come through Kathmandu first, then fly to Lukla and then to base camp.
Was there pressure to summit Everest? 
There wasn’t actually. We were quite calm. Yes, we did have our fair share of luck thanks to the good weather, but we were good climbers. We knew we had it in us to get to the top of the world’s highest peak. Our Sherpas were quite good too.
What other mountains have you climbed here? 
I’ve been to seven 8,000-metre peaks here in Nepal and led the expedition in all of them. I’ve climbed Manaslu South Face in 1972, which was my first, then Makalu South Face in 1974, Everest in 1978, Ama Dablam in 1979 where we rescued Sir Edmund Hillary’s son. I also summited Dhaulagiri, Cho Oyu South Face.
What have these mountains taught you? 
Well the one lesson that the mountains have given me is that there’s always the next time. It’s taught me that coming back down is as important as going up. I lost a friend during the Dhaulagiri expedition which still hurts me. It’s taught me that every mountain is different and each should be respected individually.
What do you do when you come to Nepal every year? 
The first thing I do is meeting my friends. After that, I go to monitor various projects which I’m funding. We’ve been doing a lot of charity work here, especially after the 2015 earthquake. We’re working on the Hillary Hospital to which my and Messner’s foundation has donated around $400,000. We’re working with Tashi Tenzing and Green Tara Foundation building schools. I also have a Sherpa Project where I take 25 Nepalis from remote areas to Austria and give them lodge management training.
This is a win-win situation for both the lodge owner in Austria who gets human resources and to Nepalis here who can learn a lot by spending three to four months in Austria. They also get a good salary there.
We’re also building schools here. One in Sindupalchok for around 200 children with Tashi Tenzing. In Chilaune of the district, we’ve built another school. We’re also working on a reforestation project in the Khumbu region. We’ve also help build a few cultural monuments in the region so people can go practice their faith there.
Wolfgang with his wife Edith
How do you raise money for these projects? 
Well, my organisation has over 150 members and we do various fundraising activities. We give lectures, attend various programmes which help us get money. If you look at the things post-earthquake, we’ve nearly spent $700,000 rebuilding schools and hospitals in the remotest parts of Nepal.
So your charity only involves Nepal? 
Yes. Just here.
What about your partners here? 
They have been important to me. Sonam Sherpa, Tsering Lama, Tashi Tenzing, Ang Rita all have been great. I can trust these people wholeheartedly. They know where help is required and through them I can send funds there. I know that the money we’re raising is going to good hands. Corruption is quite high here in Nepal, which is why we need people like them.
How often do you travel around here? 
I travel a lot. How do you think I reach 100? I love to trek around. I’ve been to some really good places. Upper Dolpo, Mustang, Nar Phu… these places aren’t visited by many. I bring friends with me most of the time and we go trekking. This year, we’re going to Langtang.
Do you think tourism has got better here?
I think it has, but there is a lot more we need to do to make sure that Visit Nepal 2020 is a success. They have increased visa fees. They take so much money for permits, but where is the money? People need to ask the government what they’re doing with the money coming in from tourists. It needs to be addressed. The private sector is doing well when it comes to tourism. However, I don’t see the government is doing enough.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/everest-climb-in-autumn-sounds-tough-but-can-be-done-garrett-madison.html,"
Garrett Madison is one of the most sought-after foreign climbers and mountain guides. Since he first summited Everest in 2006, he has led over 60 climbers to the summit of Everest and started his own company, Madison Mountaineering.
Madison holds multiple high-altitude mountaineering world records. He is the only person to have climbed Mount Everest and Lhotse in a day, that too three times. He is also the only American to have climbed K2 twice. Madison spoke to Onlinekhabar about his current expedition where he plans to take a team to the top of Everest in autumn for the first time since 2010 and about mountaineering in Nepal. Excerpts:
How did you go from being a mountain guide to starting your own company? 
I started working as a mountain guide in 1999 when I was 20. It was a summer job to guide people up Mount Rainer. That is how I started. As I loved mountaineering, I joined Alpine Accents International and worked for them until 2014 when I thought why not start my own company. That’s how Madison Mountaineering started. My maiden project was to lead the climb on Everest in 2014 and it’s been a fun but a challenging adventure ever since.
How different was running your own company from working for an expedition company? 
It’s basically the same stuff that I do now. It is just a bit more responsibility on the logistic side. But I have a good team that handles it. So I’d say I’m lucky in that regard.
You recently climbed Everest in the spring season, what made you come back in the autumn? 
I’ve never climbed Everest in autumn. However, I have attempted other 8,000 metre peaks such as Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu in autumn. But I wanted to do Everest too. The main reason is that we’re doing Everest this year because Mountain Hardware, which makes clothing equipment for high altitude climbing wanted to test its new product line. We felt that the best place and time to test it was on Everest in the autumn. We’ll be testing everything from down suits to sleeping bags to tents.
Apart from that, we at Madison Mountaineering wanted to do something unique. As the spring season is overcrowded, we wanted to see if we can market Everest for the autumn. That would help minimise the crowd during the spring. Everest hasn’t been summited in autumn since 2010 and we want to see if we can change that. We have some good climbers on the mountain like Kilian Jornet and Andrzej Bargiel so hopefully, we can work together to reach the top. Our Nepali climbers are just as good and are currently fixing ropes and arranging the base camp so we’re positive about this expedition.
But I am concerned that it’s been raining so much. Rain here means a lot of snow in the mountains and that means there’s a risk of avalanches.
How different do you expect that mountain to be in autumn as compared to spring? 
Well, post-monsoon is different for a variety of reason. Firstly, there’s is a lot of snow up there. Secondly, there are a lot fewer people on the mountain. In spring, there are around a 400-500 people on the mountain, but now there’s going to be around 10-15 max. Autumn is also more winter-like. With winter around the corner days will be shorter and will be windier. The summit weather window will also be shorter. Will be a lot challenging. I’ve done Everest 10 times all in the spring so if we can prove that Everest can be done in the autumn that would be great.
How’s rope fixing going on amidst the rain? 
It’s going on at a slow pace. The weather isn’t good and the Nepali climbers have told me that it’s very cloudy up there. They are one-quarter of the way up the Khumbu icefall. They’re hoping they’ll reach Camp 1 in a week’s time. Our plan is to reach base camp by mid-September and hope by then they’ll be able to reach Camp 2.
Your success rate is quite high. What, according to you, makes a good mountain guide? 
I’d say lots of experience and willingness to learn from mistakes and surrounding yourself with good people. You’ll also need some natural ability and some physical fitness to function well in the death zones. Apart from that we also need proper mountain training and techniques. It’s a combination of knowledge and skill I would say.
Madison on the summit of Everest.
People often say that climbing in Europe and the Americas is different from climbing in the Himalayas. How true is that? 
It’s very true.  In America and the Alps, it’s more like one-day climbs. You start from a mountain hut and climb for one day and your back. You’re just out for a day or maybe half a day. But here you’re up for two weeks. It’s a real expedition here. Have to carry a lot of stuff to be self-sufficient like medical kits, food and a lot more. There is also no quick evacuation. In the Alps, you get a helicopter rescue at any point, but you don’t get that luxury here in the Himalayas.
What do you feel is the toughest part of being a mountaineer?
I guess it’s the sacrifices you have to make. Spending all this time away from family and loved ones isn’t easy. It’s not like a normal job where you leave home and come back in the evening every day. I’m out for two-three months at a time, and spend around 10 months on the road in a year. So I’d that that is the toughest part.
Do clients appreciate your effort when you take them to the top?
They do. I feel happy when they do. But there are times when I cannot fulfil their expectations and they’re not happy. But I try to tell them that their life is much important that the summit. I don’t like risking people’s lives. My first priority is to make sure everyone comes back safe, this includes the Nepali climbers we have on our team.
Do you enjoy climbing mountains? Here the people from Khumbu climb because they don’t have a choice. They say it’s not fun. Do you have fun? 
Yes, I love climbing. This is my passion. When I was a young man and climbed my first mountain I didn’t want to look back. In the US it’s not a lucrative profession, but I didn’t care about it. Because when you do something you love, you don’t feel like its work. I love the challenge too. Made a lot of memories climbing and will continue to do so.
How satisfied do you get when to take clients up to the summit? 
It’s very satisfying as you’ve helped them reach their goal and also helped changed them in a positive way. What I like is how people get new experiences in a foreign land. They tell me they learn a lot about the country as they spend from a few weeks to a few months depending on where they are. They also make friends and take back more than just a climbing certificate.
What do you love the most about the mountains? 
Just being out there in nature with similar-minded people. We share the same passion and enthusiasm. It’s just the best thing.
When we talk about Everest, we have to talk about the traffic jam picture. For someone who was there, how bad was it? 
Well, it wasn’t as bad as the photograph. It was a busy day but it wasn’t the busiest day I’ve seen on Everest. The reason why it looked so crowded was that there were 200 people queuing up to reach the summit. If you have 100 people going up and another 100 people coming down there is sure to be a traffic jam. That’s when the photo was taken. But the media thinks that it is like that all the time which it’s not. It was maybe one hour, one day, in one year. Feel it was blown out of proportion.
Would you blame the traffic jam for all the deaths? 
I don’t think I would. The lives lost in Everest this year could have been saved with good planning and good managing. There are two types of expeditions on Everest. There is a guided expedition like mine where they hire someone like me and my company to manage logistics and in the long run take them to the summit and also make decisions for them.
And then there is the other type of expedition is when a company just manages the climber’s logistics like permits, oxygen, porters and food. But in these expeditions, the climber makes his own decisions.  The company doesn’t tell them to turn around if they can’t climb. That is when people die. Because when you’re up there you can’t think straight. And if you’re not experienced that can cause a lot more problem.
Those that died this year didn’t have experience climbing such a tough mountain.

Will the government’s plan to make it mandatory to climb a mountain in Nepal before attempting Everest prevent these deaths?
I don’t think it’s a bad idea to try to ensure that Everest climbers are more qualified. However, with this rule, if a climber has climbed K2, he/she would still be ineligible to climb Everest which is wrong in my opinion. It doesn’t make sense to me.
How has mountaineering changed in Nepal since you first came here in 2006?
For starters, there are a lot more people in the sport. I feel the sport has grown for several reason. People want to go to these iconic places like the top of Everest. And now that’s it’s possible for more people, the mountain has seen a lot of people since I first climbed in 2006.
Is the rapid growth in Nepali expedition companies the reason why the number of people climbing Everest as risen significantly? 
These new Nepali companies are simply offering a product that has a demand in the market. The climbers want this product. They want to be able to come and climb Everest at a cheaper price. Some people feel they don’t want a guy like me making decisions on their behalf. They want to make their own decisions. The clients are demanding this service and the companies we see now are just fulfilling their demands.
But is that the reason the mountains are getting inexperienced climbers which causes deaths on these 8000 m peaks?
The business model for Nepali companies is different from mine. I make sure that I have experienced climbers on my team and try to keep my team small up to 12 members. The team has high-level support as we have both high-level mountain guides and experienced Nepali high altitude climbers. Along with that we also have top equipment and ample supply of oxygen. I try to offer and run a good program on the mountain.
But the Nepali companies’ model is different. They believe in volume. They offer a similar programme for a much lower cost. Per person, there is a much smaller profit margin, but if you’re able to bring in numbers, you’re definitely going to make money. So their product is volume-based and it’s not a guided trip. The climber makes his/her own decision. The companies provide just logistics and service to climb the mountain, but there’s no one telling them if it’s safe to go up. Well, they have Nepali high altitude climbers but they can’t tell their clients not to go up and it’s dangerous.
The fatalities are that of climbers who don’t have experience and really want to go to the top of a mountain. The people compare prices and always choose a Nepali company as its half cheaper than companies like mine charge. These people don’t have anyone to ask if it’s worth the risk. Most push themselves which makes it tough on their body and collapse.
What makes you different from these other companies?
My risk tolerance is lower than theirs. They tend to think they can do anything, whereas I feel that I can’t. It’s because I am liable for the safety of my clients which is of paramount importance. I need to take that into consideration before making a risky decision. It a fundamental difference of approach. Some of my clients get really irked when people from other expedition agencies summit and we don’t. It happened this year in K2 when we came back because it was not worth the risk. But one client was not happy that we didn’t summit and other teams did. It is hard to explain to people like him that it’s not worth it. But hey, they pay a lot of money so they are right to think that way I guess.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/daraz-ceo-need-to-localise-if-we-want-to-achieve-success-in-nepal.html,"
Bjarke Mikkelsen is the co-CEO of Daraz Group, a popular online shopping company of the region. He has been with the company for the past four years. Prior to joining Daraz, Mikkelsen worked at Goldman Sachs where he worked as its Executive Director for its branch in London.
Mikkelsen spoke to Onlinekhabar about how his company has changed after being acquired by Alibaba and why localising strategies here in Nepal was important for them to grow as a business. Excerpts:
What has changed since Alibaba acquired Daraz?
Three things have changed mainly. First is the technology. Our value proposition to the customer has improved significantly as we are providing a lot more services. For example, we have started the instant messaging service which allows customers and sellers to communicate with one another in a regulated way. It has opened a world of opportunities. The way we display relevant product to relevant customers at the right time is also a huge improvement we’ve made in recent times.
Number two is the supply change. It has increased substantially as now we are working with sellers around the world and also opening up to Nepali sellers to sell to consumers around the world. This is something we’re working on as a big project with Alibaba to integrate all of their different marketplace platforms. We’re also working on a project which will allow a Nepali seller sign up on Daraz and then automatically be eligible to sell to China or anywhere around the world through one single account.
Number three is just learning. So far, we have been figuring out all on our own, but now that we are affiliated with Alibaba we can do things a lot more efficiently because what we are doing here now, they did it in China years ago.
When can people buy items from Alibaba here in Nepal?
You already can, to some extent. We have a global collection in the app through which you can directly order stuff from China.  Slowly, we will be doing more in that aspect.
Why did 11:11 fail in Nepal as compared to other markets?
In general, that was a new concept here in Nepal and we got to learn a lot from it. Alibaba’s 11:11 is the biggest shopping date worldwide and we wanted to try it here too. From a sales perspective, I don’t think it failed. The sales volume was higher than what we expected. But we had these learnings.
We found after the event the certain customers had to wait longer for the items they had ordered. But considering the order volume that we had, we actually enforced a lot after this campaign. We focused a lot on logistics infrastructure.
Since then, we have also been evaluating the performance of every seller. We do not want our customers to suffer. We sit with them and bring out solutions to make them better.
After 11:11, we also launched a campaign in Nepali New Year, and it was good. We have delivered items in a better manner during that campaign than we do on normal days. Be rest assured, 11:11 will be better this year.
How is Alibaba’s model in South Asia different from that of other countries?
I think it’s a lot more localised. What we’re doing now is trying to understand how the local sellers work and what services do they need. Because the services here may be different from, for example, the services they need in China and Malaysia where everything is digitised and integrated.
It is the same principle which is mainly about being engaged and having something for everyone and using technology to manage a huge marketplace with a lot of sellers and a lot of customers.

Is the app also localised?
It is. The algorithm, mainly, is. We look at what people are searching for and what do they want to see and we try to give them that experience. We also try doing local campaigns which aren’t happening in other countries. We did Nepali New Year earlier this year and now we are doing one for Dashain which starts on September 15.
Have you achieved the breakeven? 
No. Not yet. But we will do that. We plan to be a profitable company by 2022. So far we are still investing in the country. We need to build the infrastructure and we need to have the scale.
Kyamu, when it came to Nepal, advertised on Facebook and Google. That has now changed as you have been advertising in the mainstream media. What brought about this change? 
Advertising, in general, has changed since Kyamu was here and we just evolved with it. The manner in which Nepalis interact with media and the internet has also changed. That way we also learned year on year on what was better for our business. As for our advertising strategy, it didn’t change after we rebranded as Daraz or after Alibaba’s acquisition. When we came here with Kyamu, we came in as a startup, but now we are an established business. In general, our strategy is to stay current and relevant which is why we have been working with more influencers than before.
What inspired Daraz University? How have sellers here taken to it?
It was inspired by Taobao University in China started by Alibaba. When we first started working with Alibaba who had a gigantic university in China we wanted to do something similar to give sellers the knowhow to sell. That was the inspiration. After that, we sat down with a blank piece of paper and started to design a curriculum and we started to do it. That way anyone who has a smartphone can start his/her business.",/interview,"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 08:36:34 +0000"

After reports of a ‘mass suicide’ by monkeys in Chautara of Sindhupalchok district came out, zoologist Dr Mukesh Chalise’s phone was abuzz the entire week. Chalise, the most quoted ‘monkey expert’ in Nepali media, retired from the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University last month. Onlinekhabar recently caught up with Chalise, whose PhD research decades ago focused on the food habits of male and female monkeys.
Excerpts:
Let’s begin the conversation about the ‘mass suicide’ case. You told the media that animals don’t commit suicide or any other crime intentionally. What grounds do you have to support your thesis?
In the course of evolution, the primitive species developed the simplest of nervous systems, which would enable them to feel heat and cold; light and dark. Gradually, other organ systems developed and later specific parts such as nose, ears, and eyes came into being. Then, after thousands of years, mammals came into existence. Humans are mammals whose nervous system has achieved the highest level of development among all the species, and far high enough than lower species.
If you love someone, you can sacrifice your property for them. You can donate the blood flowing inside your body; you can even donate your own organ so that another person can lead a better life. Human beings don’t only have the highest level of benevolence, but also the highest level of selfishness. We can commit heinous crimes such as rape and murder. Suicides are also a result of the highest depression resulted by the influence of genetic characters, religious, social and political situation that impact on human instinct.
Though monkeys are also mammals, they cannot develop such desires because their brain is not fully developed for that. They can make efforts to save themselves and their partners, but they cannot think of killing themselves intentionally. Many animals die falling off cliffs while running to protect themselves from predators, but it should not mean that they commit suicide in fear of predators.
Many people in the Tarai report to me that they have seen many langurs falling off the trees to kill themselves after seeing carnivores, but it is not true. What happens in such cases is that the langurs lose balance after seeing predators and accidentally fall down.
Monkeys have a peculiar interest in investigating things around them, but humans misinterpret it as ‘mischief’. When they find new things, they check if they can eat it; when they go to any new place, they check if they can play there. In 1996, a monkey in Pashupatinath area of Kathmandu touched an unshielded wire; it received an electric shock and cried–without detaching itself from the wire. Another monkey heard the cry and came to save it; it also cried for help. In this way, a total of 41 monkeys died in their efforts to save one monkey. This cannot be considered a mass suicide case because they wanted to save their friend, but that does not mean they wanted to kill themselves.
Like other human societies, Nepali society is also living with animals for ages. But why doesn’t it understand basic things about animals and misinterpret cases like these? Wasn’t it the responsibility of academic institutions like university departments, such as the one you worked for over three decades?
In order to understand why we failed, we need to understand how our education system was developed. If you analyse the historical development of schools in Nepal, you see that our education system always concentrates on meeting the needs of the bureaucracy; this is reflected in both what is taught and how it is taught. It was not concerned with producing experts of certain disciplines or connecting sciences with society. Before the ‘new education system’ (Naya Shiksha) was implemented in the early 1970s, we were required to study ‘civic education’ (Nagarikshastra) and ‘bylaws’ (Ainshastra) in school. They were compulsory subjects, but maths and science were not. We had to learn how to prepare a ‘tamasuk’ (an agreement to facilitate local loan transactions) and how to fold a paper to write a tamasuk.

At the higher level also, the study of science began only in 1959 with the establishment of the Tribhuvan University. Among various disciplines of natural science, many people were attracted to physics because it was comparatively easier and it would not require the students to go beyond the campus. Subjects like zoology came much later, in 1965, because they were more difficult and required practical insights. In the beginning, professors from other countries would visit Tri-Chandra College to teach us. Our university [Tribhuvan University] did not conduct exams on such subjects. If you check the certificates of science professors of that time, you can find they acquired the degrees from foreign institutions including the Patna University of India. Overall, the education system focused on meeting immediate needs, it did not help address practical concerns of common people and uplift the country in the world of sciences.
So, how long did the problem exist? It must have been solved by now. 
No, even our academic programmes just copied courses from Patna University. Even after I joined the university, I remember, we had to struggle to include material related to Nepal’s flora and fauna in the curricula. Intentionally or unintentionally, the professors copied from others, without considering the dignity of their own country.
So far, only around a dozen have completed their PhD in zoology from the Tribhuvan University. I did my PhD in 1995; I was the seventh Nepali zoologist to obtain a PhD and the first in my generation to do so. In the past 24 years since then, only eight persons have done their PhD in this field from the TU. Some went to foreign universities.
Exactly! The number of science students at the high school level has significantly increased. But most of them study medical science or engineering. No one is willing to take up zoology or botany.
Many students, who studied zoology at the master’s level, did not continue their study in the field, but joined the civil service. Former chief secretary Bimal Koirala; and former secretaries Bal Krishna Prasain, Madhu Raman Acharya, BHoj Raj Ghimire, Sushil Ghimire and Mahashram Sharma studied zoology. But they left the discipline after realising that the civil service did not have any position for zoologists. The Public Service Commission calls applications for various positions that require people who have studied accounts, statistics, forestry, geology, or medical science, but not zoology.
Even the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation did not accept us. From its inception, it decided to recruit people who have studied forestry. They though zoologists know about animals, not about the forest. All high position holders of the department are students of forestry. They continued to ignore zoologists.
The zoology department of Tribhuvan University has so far produced around 1,000 zoologists; around 100 have completed their PhD from foreign universities. But still, the Public Service Commission does not recognise the discipline.
Of late, some national and international nongovernment organisations have begun looking for zoologists. Our students have achieved remarkable scientific results in exploration, the discovery of species and impact assessments for developmental projects.
Maybe the commission thought the discipline did not have any importance at the government departments. After all, they are functioning okay even without the zoologists.
No. Zoology is one of the most important scientific disciplines for Nepal. We still proudly claim that we are an agricultural country. Animal rearing is a major branch of Nepali agriculture system, and this is where the farmers can use zoological knowledge. Zoology gives you information about habits and behaviours, life cycles, food systems, reproduction systems and habitats of animals and birds. It means if farmers begin their businesses with the knowledge of zoology, they can reap additional benefits.
If you talk about agriculture-based industries, zoology is equally important. For example, you want to open a modern slaughterhouse. You need zoological knowledge there because veterinarian knowledge is not enough.
Zoology is important for the social sciences as well. You may know that Germans developed the kindergarten system in education after noticing that animals that were separated from their parents early could not socialise well. You can also take the Sindhupalchok case as an example here. After the incident of the deaths of monkeys, locals now need to take additional safety measures to protect their children from drowning. Studying animals has always helped the human society.
If you talk about medical science, if you can extract venom from poisonous snakes like cobra, you can use that to produce anti-venom medicines and save thousands of lives. You might know that the vaccines that are applied to human beings were first tested on animals…

Yes. But, rights activists have always protested the act of using animals to test medicines. Do you think that is ethical?
So do you want to kill human beings in order to save animals? Without causing significant loss to their number, we need to use a few animals to save humanity. Do you wish for the continuous increase in the number of leopards around Kathmandu at the cost of lives of people living there? Or do you think that is ethical?
I am clear that we need to kill animals if they cause harm to humans or other beings. As a human being, I don’t want the destruction of the human race just to increase the number of other species. I continue giving the medicines tested on monkeys to my aged parents who are suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes. If you love monkeys more than your parents, you can abstain from using the medicines. If you want your mother to die in the pain of uterine cancer because you don’t want to carry out a surgery that is tested on an animal first, that is fine. Do you know that cataract surgery started by testing it on monkeys? But if you don’t like it, fine. I don’t argue with you.
But if we develop zoological studies in Nepal, the country can earn millions of dollars every year by selling the medicines. If the country wants to capitalise on its biodiversity, zoological knowledge should be used in medical science. For example, China earns money from every panda of a particular species that is born in any part of the world because the species is originally available in China only. Similarly, macaques (known as red monkeys) that are available in Nepal are ‘purer’ than those in India or China; hence we can experiment medicines of AIDs and tuberculosis on them, and earn millions of rupees in revenues. We should move towards that model. In the name of rights, we should not promote wrong concepts and practices that avoid the value of natural resources. We also should be aware that such experiments affect only very few animals.
Fine, perhaps we can discuss the ethical concerns in another meeting. Now, I want to conclude the conversation on a positive note. Tell us something from the field that is improving.
The zoological study in Nepal has shifted from the traditional approach to the application-centric approach. TU has developed different courses for four branches of zoology; namely: fishery, entomology, parasitology, and ecology. Recently, our students have worked for hydropower projects, urban planning and forest monitoring. Our parasitologists have emerged as professors of medical science. The discipline’s scope has expanded.
Does it mean that Mukesh Chalise will not be the single source for media to talk about any zoological issue now onwards?
Haha… You need to know why I was called and quoted every time. Thanks to my family’s encouragement, I began exploring new places and study about animals living there from my youth. Before Makalu Barun was named a national park, I visited that place and carried out the research. When I submitted my proposal about monkeys to the university for my PhD, many people laughed at me. They said I could have received huge foreign grants if I had chosen elephants, tigers or rhinoceros. I said I did not need money, but knowledge.
Many things are yet to be improved in the discipline in Nepal. The discipline has to be made more practical and connected to daily life. For example, institutes of eastern Nepal should teach their students about parasites and insects affecting the tea cultivation; colleges of western Nepal should teach them about tigers and elephants. They should know why Indian elephants cross the big Mahakali and come to Nepal. The students of the Koshi region need to learn why wild water buffaloes are found in that region of the country only while similar river systems exist in Karnali, Rapti and Narayani regions as well. The students should be taught about pesticides that are applied to vegetables of this region. If that had been the case, our students would have tested pesticide residue on the vegetables imported from India even if the government did not care about it.
This is a global practice and we should follow that. We should thoroughly overhaul the university curricula. Otherwise, the degree you have earned only serves as your prestige label.",/interview,"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 04:18:00 +0000"

With the controversy over a Public Service Commission notice calling applications for 9,000 plus vacancies at the local level, Nepali political leaders and commentators are once again debating the relevance of reservation allocated to various social groups. Along with that, many issues about rights of the disadvantaged groups have come to the fore again.
Dalits, or ‘the untouchables’, constitute a significant section of the disadvantaged populations in Nepal. While many stakeholders associate this problem with Hinduism, Harvard scholar Suraj Yengde from India argues it is a global problem. Yendge claims he has understood multiple dimensions of the issue as he spent a miserable childhood in a Dalit settlement in Maharashtra before he got a scholarship to study at prestigious international institutions like Harvard Kennedy School.
Yengde was recently in Nepal to discuss his new book ‘Caste Matters’. He talked to Onlinekhabar over his growth into a global Dalit scholar and his thesis that an independent global Dalit movement is needed to solve the global issue.
Excerpts:
How did you rise from an underprivileged young boy to an international scholar?
My story reflects the story of most of the Dalits in India and South Asia. Different people came into my life in different life. The most important person in my life was my father, who was a peon at a private bank. As an elder child, he had to take many responsibilities. But, he was really devoted to the social movement of Dalits. He was associated with various organisations. He was educated up to the ninth grade only, but he was learned beyond educational qualifications. He was an activist who was interested in empowering his community.
As a Dalit, the only option you have, except doing your traditional occupation, is education. If you don’t pursue education, you go back to your caste-centered traditional job such as cleaning bathrooms and toilets, doing manual labour.
We belong to a caste called Mahars, we were traditional village servants, not limited to one specific job, but doing all kinds of menial jobs like cleaning the carcass of dead animals. But Mahars were also like militants; they fought against the Brahmins.
Hence, my father decided to educate me because I could have ended up like every other member of my community doing menial jobs. Or I could have turned into a criminal like a pickpocket if not educated.
But how did you pursue your education despite your miserable economic condition?
I grew up below the poverty line. Five members of our family lived in one small room. But, my father wanted to educate his children in an English medium school. All his colleagues did not take it well. They said to him, “You are just a bank peon. The school fee is more than your salary. How can you afford it?” Paradoxically, the manager of my father’s bank had also enrolled his son in the same school. He was my classmate.
Every week, we had a sports hour at school. I did not have additional shoes, so would wear my school shoes for football and other sports. I only had two socks, and they had to be washed again. The same with clothes; it rained the next morning you washed them, you would have to go to the school in wet clothes. Further, if you did not wear your school uniforms, they would ask you to go back home.
But I liked my school because home was not the place that I wanted to live. There was sewage running outside, and it smelled foul every day. Women would be fighting. There used to be filthy abuses. People were literally beating each other. The school was an escape from every such trauma.
So how did your father pay your tuition fees which were higher than his salary?
My education was also supported by my uncles, paternal as well as maternal uncles. My mother would frequently go to sit with her brother and ask him to support me. Because the brother-sister bond is deep in our culture, he would support me. Also, we borrowed money. My mother had one mangalsutra that she always put in pawn to take loans for me.
But still, I could not participate in recreations and other activities in the school. It was a kind of limited education. I used to feel ashamed of my status. I used to lie to my friends about my dad’s profession because they were people of high castes. I used to tell them that he was a bank clerk. In fact, he was a servant to their parents and I didn’t want my schoolmates to know that.
Till when did you remain ashamed of your identity? When did you gather the courage to feel that you had to talk about it?
I got a scholarship to study abroad and went to England for a master’s in law. My specialisation was human rights law. While doing research, I saw that the problem of untouchability was across the continents, in Africa, in Europe, in South Asia, in North and Latin Americas. But, I realised the research has not been done; and hence I had thought the problem I was grappling with was my personal problem, but a structural one.
It was in 2011 only. Since then, I felt good because I was not alone.

Besides that it was a global problem, what were other highlights of your learning and recommendations to cope with them?
We have rejected the humanity of the Dalit population. We have not given them a desired equal respect.
To solve it, the Dalit voice needs to be prioritised. The Dalit women, doubly or triply oppressed, need to be brought to the front. We have to look in a mirror that we have never seen ourselves in. It is important if we want to go to the next level of human achievement. As long as caste system remains there, we cannot go beyond the medieval-era society; we cannot become modern. Even though we have fashionable clothes, our minds will be still rooted in the medieval era thinking.
So far, the cosmetic change has happened, but not the structural one. For that to happen, we have to move away from the medieval-era thinking. If we carry that, our modernity will hit a wall, it will not progress.
Right now, we need an autonomous Dalit identity movement which also makes other caste groups feel that they also need to be a part of it.
Can you please go back and explain what did you mean by the medieval-era thinking and what is the thinking that you want to replace it with?
Nepal still practises untouchability. It was created in the past to make sure that one group has supremacy over another, to make sure that the people working in the farms and fields remained there for generations. The caste system gives it a sanction. In the South Asian society governed by the Hindu ideology, the caste system becomes a religious authority.
If you want to think about the medieval era thinking, think about how many Dalit priests are there in temples of Nepal. How many Dalit politicians are there in Parliament? How many Dalit bureaucrats are there in policy-making positions? How many Dalit independent media enterprises do exist? More importantly, how many Dalits are valued for what they are beyond their caste? You get very negative answers to these questions.
You mean to say the caste system is a problem of the Hindu society. 
What I am advocating right now is the caste problem is a global problem. The term itself is a Portuguese term, meaning ‘division’. If you go to any society, there are structural divisions historically. Muslims, Buddhists, and people believing in every other religion that trusts in the idea of supremacy practice caste. Supremacy exists in Europe also, for example, white supremacy. For me, there is a global Dalit and there is a global Brahmin.
But, there are similarities and differences between these practices. The first similarity is the historic form of oppression continues. The second, it is based on one’s birth; whichever family you are born to defines your lifetime. The third is, it’s structural; structures have been brought in. Fourth, it is personal, people practice caste discrimination based on their personal understanding. Fifth, the system is retained in various cultural forms. Then of course, economically and politically, they are at the bottom. The struggle for economic rights has to be a part of Dalit movements…

Exactly! Many sociologist scholars and the public believe that caste is an outdated issue and it doesn’t have any effect anymore. What matters more is your control over socioeconomic resources, decided by your class.
This is a very farcical argument. It is trying to dissuade and befool the public. Every society that is economically divided has other structures that make the divisions possible. The divisions are not only results of different amounts of control over the capital; the division thrived because the caste system already existed.
If the caste system is outdated, why do the Brahmins still continue to retain their control over the spiritual wealth? Why do they still have a monopoly over the temples? Those who believe that the caste system is outdated have to give up the privileges they had because of their caste.
The caste system is very much intact and it needs to be seriously handled.
But how can you claim that Brahmins and other people have caste privileges? They too have to do a lot of struggles if they don’t have control over socioeconomic resources. Instead, Dalits have privileges in the form of reservation.
In a caste-based society, if you are a Brahmin, you are already 10 steps ahead. Your network is already set up. The very element of being a Brahmin carries a certain privilege. You are not brought up with the ideology of being inferior. You are always taught to rule and command. You are taught to walk in confidence. It’s such an enormous privilege that nobody can take away from you.
Imagine some Dalits living in your community, whose parents are living as servants at other people’s houses or cleaning the sewage of their community. What are these parents going to teach their children? What is the future they will offer to them? They don’t have a vision because they are not taught how to think. More importantly, they don’t have idols–whom they are looking up to where the father is a drunkard and there are altercations with other people in the community?
Caste system takes away confidence from every Dalit person. Compare that with being a Brahmin, who has a monopoly over education for thousands and thousands of years.
So you still believe that a reservation based on caste categories in public service and other sectors is still relevant?
The reservation system is meant to uplift the communities who are not at a similar level. It is an opportunity for all of us to make sure that people who never had access to the resources can come with us. Through reservations, we have a golden opportunity to meet fellow people to come onto a similar plain and have camaraderie.
But now, some people are fighting against the reservation or affirmative actions. These are people who lack confidence, who don’t have merits. If you have merit, come what may, you will still survive. Why are you getting insecure about the people who have come to school for the first time? If you have merit, you should be able to compete with the people of any quality, any talent, and any background.
The reservation system should be more radical. It should go beyond giving seats. It should create more positive discriminations. We should make sure that the system supports the persons belonging to the lower caste to go to the top.
But focusing on the reservation, we are missing a lot. Reservation and other progressive measures should go together. We need more than a reservation.

Should the reservation system continue indefinitely or do we need to set a time limit?
Time limit is subjective. We can say, “Tomorrow, we will finish untouchability.” If we finish it tomorrow, no reservation is needed. But, it’s only imaginative thought. It is just an attempt to befool everyone.
Let’s say, the caste system is a train passing through a village. Its speed is so high that many people are missing out. Reservation provides the people with a mechanism to catch up on the train. But that does not take you to the final destination. Reservation and redistribution of resources have to go side by side. We will need at least 10 to 15 measures like the reservation for us to reach the common goal.
Ending reservation is not a solution. If you want to have equality, there should be a proportional representation of every caste group. Say, if there are 12-13 per cent Brahmins, give them 12-13 per cent reservation. Let their communities get represented proportionally.
Otherwise, it will only end at the moment when you stop treating other Dalit persons as sub-humans, as others not belonging to our group. Don’t worry about ending the reservation. The moment equality will be established, the Dalits themselves will get rid of it.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/everest-season-2019-nepals-image-was-tarnished-due-to-lack-of-coordination-among-expedition-operators-says-ang-tsering-sherpa.html,"
Ang Tshering Sherpa was born in Khumjung Solu Khumbu, to a yak trader and mountain man who befriended Edmund Hillary. Sherpa received his education at a school set up by Hillary. He was involved in mountain various expeditions, helping his father assist climbers. In 1982, he bought a trekking company called Asian Trekking, which grew into a trusted name in the business. Sherpa, who also served as the chair of Nepal Mountaineering Association, is also the President of Climate Alliance of Himalayan Communities (CAHC) and Honorary Consul of Belgium to Nepal. Onlinekhabar’s Shashwat Pant recently talked to Sherpa about mountaineering on Everest and issues that have come to the fore during the climbing season this spring. Translated excerpts:
Let’s begin by talking about the yesterday of mountain climbing in Nepal. How was it different from what it is now?
Until the 1990s, we had a system called the ‘one-team-one route’ system under which only one expedition would be allowed to climb a mountain using one route. But after the restoration of democracy, the government started issuing permits to multiple groups for the same route. There are many routes to mountains such as Everest, but most of them are difficult. There’s one route via the South Col which everyone wants to take.
Similarly, the climbing equipment used to be heavy and bulky. A lot of improvements have been made in the last few years to make thing s more comfortable. There was a time when Sherpas did not have the skills nor the training to climb mountains. We didn’t get weather reports the way we do now. We had to rely on brute force.
In 1963, when the first American expedition came to Nepal, their communication equipment had to be carried by seven porters. But now communications equipment have changed and become smaller. An average bottle of oxygen would weigh around 7-8 kgs. But now it is hardly 3kg.
If you talk about the climbers, things have changed there as well. In the past, we used to have expeditions from specific countries–the government in those countries would sponsor such expeditions. The team members would climb another mountain together before coming to Everest to improve their coordination. But now we have mixed teams whose members do not know each other until they reach base camp.
How important is mountaineering for Nepal’s tourism?
Mountaineering provides employment to so many people and brings money to Nepal. It is also one of the biggest means to promote Nepal. Whenever someone decides to climb Everest, the person talks to the local media about his/her plans. When they come here, they send constant updates saying they have reached base camp, they have set foot on Camp II and so on. Journalists also come to Nepal to cover the expeditions. Their family members friends and sponsors are also interested in what goes on. When someone is done summiting Everest, he/she writes a book, prepares a documentary or presents his/her story before large gatherings. We’ve seen that expedition members have made effective promotion of Nepal.
Over the years, various issues have propped up in the mountaineering business in Nepal. The first of these problems is that Everest is becoming dirty.
The first thing I want to say is that because of climate change, snow is melting and waste that was buried in snow is propping out. The other thing is that in 1993, a photo in an international magazine showed that Everest was becoming a garbage dump. The photo brought a lot of criticism, but it also raised our awareness about the issue.
In 1996, we conducted a clean-up campaign and started a scheme under which we provide cash for waste. The government also introduced a system under which climbers have to deposit a certain amount as a waste deposit. There is an anecdote I want to share. I remember a Russian team making its way to the base camp huffing and puffing and carrying loads of garbage on their back. They were thinking that Nepali officials would come to inspect their waste. But no one came. This shows that we need good monitoring to back up rules to keep the mountain clean.
Do you think mountaineering in Nepal, received a lot of bad press this year especially because of the infamous ‘traffic jam’?
I think we could have easily managed the traffic jam. The representatives of the mountaineering operators’ association tried to coordinate the expeditions, but the operators did not coordinate with them. This year, we had a climbing window from May 21-25. While 60 people made their way to the top on the 21st, 300 attempted to climb the mountain on the 22nd. But on the 24th only 15-16 people attempted, and by 25th everyone had left. If the expeditions had coordinated, then 100 people could have attempted on 22nd, or 50 people on the 23d and so on. They would not have had to stand in line for a long time. The three-hour-long jam tarnished Nepal’s image; as climbers spent time on the line, they got altitude sickness, some of them suffered from frost bites.
Do you think any of the nine deaths this year could be attributed to the traffic jam?
No, one died of the traffic jam this year. What happened was that some of the climbers spent all their energy going up, and they did not have it in them to come down.
The other important issue we face is that of human waste. During the climbing season, which lasts for around one-and-a-half months, we have 700-800 people on a mountain where we don’t have toilets. This is a problem with all popular mountains. For that reason, we came up with the idea of Everest Eco Expedition in 2008. Under the expedition, we bring special bags made in America to dispose of human waste. The bag has special enzymes that decompose human waste. The bag itself is also biodegradable–it degrades in around three years. We bring the human waste to Gorakhshep and bury it in pits. Even if we fail to bring the bags to base camp, it will decompose in three years. I think that all mountaineering companies should use these kinds of bags, the government should also make it mandatory for them to use it.
 

Following reports of deaths on Everest and the government’s decision to issue a record number of permits this year, there have been calls to reform the way permits are issued. Some are saying that the government should make it mandatory for anyone who wishes to climb Everest to at least climb a 6,000m-odd mountain to prove that they are worthy of climbing the highest mountain in the world. It this something new?
Yes, we suggested to the government to implement a rule that would make it mandatory for anyone who wishes to climb Everest to first climb a 7,000m peak. We did that for two reasons, first the climbers themselves would be more confident and second, the human resources we have could be utilised better. But we could not implement the decision as foreign climbers said that mountains in Europe which are only a few thousand metres tall are more difficult to climb than the 7,000m mountains in Nepal. Some diplomats based in Kathmandu were also against the idea so it could not be implemented.
The other issue that comes up regularly is about the local people of the Everest region. While there are people who are benefiting from tourism, there are others who are not involved in the tourism business. How are those people benefiting from tourism giving back to the people who are not?
I understand that the situation is not easy for them. Daily commodities have become expensive because of tourism. There are monks and nuns, along with the elderly, who do not have anything to do with tourism. There are also those people who do not live on popular tourist routes. I think it is the social responsibility of mountaineering operators to help them sustain. When we had a helicopter company, we would ferry essentials such as grains, tea and sugar for these people. But now, they have become more prosperous. Now we are thinking of new ways to help them.
In one of the regions, where we work, the local community chopped down a forest in one year. I asked them if they knew how much time it takes for a forest to grow. They said, “400-500 years.” When I asked them why they’d cut the trees if they knew what went into growing the forest, they said that they cannot keep their families hungry to conserve the forest. Which is why we are starting an awareness campaign to make these people aware of the importance of trees and also the impact of global warming on the mountains.
To wrap up, do you have any vision of how the mountaineering business in Nepal should move forward?
I think the most important thing is to build a system. I would like to share an example. When I went to Europe to climb Mt Blanc, we saw that around 50,000 people come to the base of the mountain– something like our Namche– every year. But when we climbed the mountain, there were around 100 people ahead of us and another 150 behind us. I’d imagined that only around 16,000-17,000 people would climb the mountain every year, but my son told me that more than 21,000 people climb the mountain every year and it was not dirty. They have a strict monitoring mechanism in place. Sagarmatha is 4-5 times bigger than Mt Blanc, we can easily manage it with the right system.
What about the liaison officers? Are they not doing the monitoring?
We say that instead of deploying government officers as liaison officers, the government should deploy climbers to monitor activities on the mountain. The liaison officers cause problems only, even when they are not at base camp. When they do come to base camp–like the 4-5 of the 47 officers this year– they demand chicken and mutton every day and hot water to go the toilet in a place where boiling water is very difficult. There are officers who stay in Namche and play cards the whole day. If they lose, they make the operators pay. Some officers even don’t care to leave Kathmandu. They make arrangements with the airlines to produce fake tickets and hotels in Namche to produce fake bills.",/interview,"Tue, 02 Jul 2019 04:51:54 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/this-man-cannot-walk-now-he-hopes-his-artworks-will-take-him-around-the-world.html,"Ramesh Barahi
For the past six years, Ramesh Barahi has been trying his hand at painting, but he does not have the comfort of boasting himself as an artist at various events and gatherings. Owing to a physical disability, he cannot move alone.
Yet, this 32-year-old man from Sundhara of the ancient Patan city in Kathmandu is committed to continuing his struggle to make himself recognised as an artist and support his family with the proceeds. He also wants to inspire others, ‘abled’ and ‘differently-abled’ alike.
“I love to paint when I am happy or bored,” Barahi says, “I never feel limited because of my condition.” Instead, he has perceived painting as a medium that would help him explore the world.
Overcoming limitations
A person with short stature, Barahi suffers a medical condition named hydrocephalus, in which there is excessive cerebrospinal fluid in his brain.  His bones are also fragile. Therefore, he cannot move whenever he wants. He needs a wheelchair or a walker to roam around.
“My parents were hopeless that I should live,” Barahi explains, “because my limbs were like cotton.”
Commuting has always been an issue for Barahi. “Public buses do not usually stop for us. Even taxis are reluctant to take us because of our wheelchair,” he says, “When they are ready, they ask more money.”

He loves to go around Mangal Bazaar, which is in a ten-minute walking distance from his house during the evenings, but the road turns out to be a hellish experience for him.
“The road is not as good as it was in the past,” Barahi expresses his dissatisfaction.  “Normal people can walk there. They do not have experiences of using a wheelchair.”
Now, he recommends, “They need to understand our problem. In other countries, there are disabled friendly infrastructures. The roads should be equally accessible to everyone. Our needs are not prioritised much. And we are never into the limelight. I feel sad that the differently-abled are not in the government’s priority.”
Yet, so far, his confidence has been his lifeblood, and of late he has found the medium of colours to assert his presence. “Even if I cannot be mobile much, I wish my art explored the world. It would mean that I would be going everywhere through my art.
Struggle to make living
Perhaps confidence is not enough to make a living. Hence, this confident man turns restless whenever people talk about his earning.
“I am not as economically independent as I wish to be” Barahi reflects on his experiences. “People usually spectate. My paintings are piling up and I do not sell them much. People do not understand my needs. People have asked me to draw their portraits before. But when I quote my price, they think it’s expensive.”
But even in these hard times, his family has supported him. “I get very depressed sometimes but I talk to my father or meet my friends to forget these pains.”
“Others tell me that I am lucky to have very caring parents. They tell stories of other people living with different disabilities being locked or chained. They say I have freedom. I myself met a few people who were chained during my treatment at Patan Community-based Rehabilitation Organisation (Patan CBR).”
Barahi has found a brother is an employee of his father’s handicraft workshop because he, too, cannot speak and hear. Yet, the father has mobilised him in assisting Barahi in his daily activities.
Ramesh Barahi is flanked by his father (left) and a man who assists him to roam around.
“We go out together and he takes me around, pushing my wheelchair. I signal him and he understands my gestures.”
Now, Barahi wants some woman to marry him so that she could provide him emotional support whenever needed.
“I wish I had a life partner. I will not have my parents or Raj Kumar Dai (his dad’s employee) around me all the time. I might need someone to take care of me. But people laugh at this. They do not understand that I have a life to spend.”
Becoming an artist
Due to his disabilities, Barahi could not complete his school. He dropped out in the seventh grade.
“My school was half an hour away from my home,” he remembers. “Although I had good friends and good teachers, I couldn’t go to school anymore. There was a person in my father’s workshop that used to take me to school on his bicycle. Later he went abroad.”

The struggle to become an artist was even harder. “My legs are weak. I wanted to go to take art classes, but I could not. I used to cry. I wanted to learn but I had no one to teach me. “
Eventually, he started taking art classes with Erina Tamrakar, a renowned Nepali contemporary artist.
“At first, it was hard for my teacher to teach me painting. But understanding my condition, she changed her approach. She helped me put my hand in the right position to hold a pencil and held my hand herself so that I could move it on the paper.”
Building on her lessons, Barahi has had three art exhibitions so far. Currently, he runs a gallery, Barahi Kalaa Kwotha, near his home in Sundhara, Patan.

Once, Barahi had an opportunity to meet and gift the executive chief of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, his portrait during Dahal’s premiership. Barahi recalls, “It was one of my best experiences so far.”
Asserting the self
In a society where differently-abled people are treated well, out of pity or sympathy rather than respect, Barahi is trying hard to make his self-esteem high as an artist.
“Contemporary artists are more respected today than yesterday. I feel happy to be recognised.  I get constructive criticism sometimes. In my exhibition at Bhrikutimandap, there were many who commented on what I could improve upon.”
But some of his social experiences are bad too. He frequently feels bullied by his neighbours and others. But instead of limiting his endeavours, such encounters make him stronger to assert the identity of differently-abled persons in society.
Therefore, he has recently gathered two other differently-abled friends and begun doing the art together.  “We enjoy each other’s company very much. Sometimes, we dance together,” Barahi happily shares, “We worked together on painting and sold it abroad.”

Despite all the odds, Barahi is proud of what he has achieved so far. “I feel I have done respectable work. I am proud of my artworks. People talk to me with respect.”
“But I wish those who respect me would also buy my paintings so that I could live a dignified life.”",/lifestyle,"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 03:44:03 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/what-astha-rauts-father-has-to-say-about-the-airport-controversy.html,"Hari Bahadur Raut
Hari Bahadur Raut is a renowned folk musician of the country. However, since the past week, people are identifying her as the father of Astha Raut. As Astha is also a popular singer of the country, Hari Bahadur should have been proud of the identity.
In fact, he is always proud of his daughter. That’s why he recently came to Onlinekhabar to apologise on behalf of his daughter.
Since Astha’s reported disagreement with a police staffer at the Tribhuvan International Airport on January 15, she has earned an ill repute. If that is not enough, police have been given a warrant for her arrest.
So what does Hari Bahadur feel these days?
—
Hari Bahadur was busy with his own stuff when it happened. He knew his daughter was heading to Sikkim for a tour. However, with hectic schedules on both sides, there was not much communication in between. With Astha’s remarkable popularity, it was nothing new for the parents that she was not home. Sometimes Astha could not even update her parents about her schedule. She would always be rushing.
Hariba Hadur, however, has devised a trick to learn about her trips. “When she is touring abroad, she leaves the small suitcase at home”, he says. “And when she is visiting within Nepal, she leaves the big one.” She had taken away her smaller case last week.
—
Hari Bahadur was unaware of the incident before he was called by a journalist. The caller had viewed Astha’s live Facebook post that had gone viral on the day of Maghe Sankranti. As the report told him about the video, Hari Bahadur also checked the post. Meanwhile, his phone kept ringing.
“My daughter behaves aggressively”, Hari Bahadur says, “She is reactive to unjust treatment. She speaks her heart out. Her reaction was probably caused by some bad treatment.” Nevertheless, the confident man maintains, “But she also did not choose her words much wisely either.”
Later, the CCTV footage of the quarrel leaked out. It too received mixed reactions from the public. While some people have consoled Astha, others have criticised her actions. What does Hari Bahadur think about it?
“You cannot hear any audio there”, he says. “It is, hence, hard to jump into any conclusion. The only thing I can say about it is that, if the policewoman had not used any foul language, my daughter would not have reacted as such. There must have been mistakes from both sides.”

“Maybe wrong actions were taken by both parties,” he adds, siding with his daughter “But everyone has a right to speak the truth. What would be the difference between the Panchayat System and the modern days if one has to fear to speak for themselves?”
As the case is under police investigation, he states that he could not express much about it. “The police have received a warrant against my daughter. I am waiting for what happens next.”
But, he does not believe that his daughter will be taken into custody.
“The police have their own responsibilities. Many culprits of crimes such as rapes and murders are still at large. I do not think that the police system at whole will be after my daughter for few bad choices of words.”
—
Hari Bahadur also accuses the media of making a mountain out of the mole. He says he has been hurt by headlines such as “Astha Raut at large”.
“Everyone knows that my daughter is touring Sikkim at present. She has agreed to assist in the ongoing investigation. She will return when her programme ends. She might cut short her schedule if the police want her here. How can anyone claim that my daughter is into hiding? How can media personnel report the only one-sided story?”
“Although she seems stubborn outside, she has a very soft heart. She gets emotional very soon. She has cried many times over the phone since the incident. She has committed to reporting everything to the police,”
He is also dissatisfied with the police for filing a case regarding the matter.
“Such things can be settled with a discussion with the concerned party. No one benefits in raising such issues. The country will be in loss as it is celebrating the Visit Nepal Nepal 2020 as artists are also promoting the campaign nationally and internationally.”",/lifestyle,"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 04:53:43 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kokroma-blending-the-uniqueness-of-nepali-bhoto-with-european-business-tricks.html,"A child wears Kokroma daura-suruwal.
Rewati Gurung was well-exposed to the western world during her formative years. She studied English literature in her master’s first and moved to development studies–both courses were dominated by theories and examples from America and Europe. Consequently, her brain was programmed to think that foreigners, whites in particular, were better than Nepalis.
In 2015, Gurung attended a summer school in Finland, during which she learned about the impacts of ‘Finnish Baby Box‘, a cradle along with a package of clothes uniquely designed for newly born infants and their moms after World War II. Three years later, she ordered one such box to be delivered to her in Kathmandu, all the way from Helsinki. Having seen some women-led enterprises in Nepal, Gurung was thinking if any Nepali woman could replicate the Finnish model. It was a part of her personal research.
Gurung’s ‘colonised’ brain was expecting some ‘scientifically-designed’ and ‘real European’ items in the box. “But, I was shocked…,” when the filmmaker-cum-enterprises narrates it after nearly two years, the ‘shock’ is reflected on her face again, “… because that box had something exactly like our bhoto.” [Bhoto is a typically-designed homemade vest for children in Nepal.]
That ‘Finnish bhoto’ brought a paradigm shift in her mind. At first, it compelled her to research why Nepali and Finnish societies have the same kinds of apparel for babies. After completing the research, she decided that she would follow, not replicate, the business model and design a ‘Nepali’ baby box instead. Once the white-is-better thinker, Gurung today owns a startup named Kokroma that manufactures and sells Nepali-design baby clothes.
The science of Nepali baby garments

The findings of Gurung’s informal research were interesting. She got answers to the questions like why a bhoto usually has an inner layer (bhitri), why it has laces (tunas) instead of buttons, and why they fill pillows with mustard seeds.
“From old grannies in my extended family and neighbourhood, I learned that the inner layer of your bhoto has two functions: it absorbs sweat, and it protects the baby’s soft skin from the less soft outer,” she elaborates, “Likewise, the laces were scientific because the kids could swallow buttons.”
She also learned that the Nepali society preferred pure cotton for baby clothing “because it is a natural fibre; it does not cause any harm even if the baby chews and swallows it.” Similarly, mustard seeds are filled in the pillows because they help the baby put the head in a right posture. “You cannot use millet seeds or anything similar because millet easily breaks into dust and it has a certain smell that makes the infant sneezing.”
Having learned the rationale of the old science and seen Europeans following the same, Gurung then decided to produce a ‘Nepali baby box’. She initially thought she would also use cardboards to make the bed/box as it is handier than a kokro, a traditional Nepali bamboo crib. “But, as I began exploring, I found several advantages of the kokro,” she explains, “The flooring in Nepali houses is not as fine as it is in other countries. Cardboards are not much sustainable on such floors.”
Therefore, Gurung not only included a kokro in her production list, but she also made it her brand name. [‘Kokroma’ means inside a kokro.]
Empowering women
Gurung says there is another story behind the establishment of Kokroma, besides her summer school experience.
Kokroma employs six tailors, all women, and Gurung claims she pays them a ‘fair wage’.
After attending an all-women filmmaking workshop in 2017, Gurung independently produced a documentary featuring Drichu, a local clothing brand of Bauddha. Building on this experience, Gurung and Finnish filmmaker Gary Wornell applied for a World Bank-assisted project run by the Poverty Alleviation Fund. They were selected and assigned to make documentaries featuring women entrepreneurs from across the country.
“Between December 2017 and February 2018, we travelled from Taplejung to Dailekh and collected stories about Dhaka weaving, Mithila art, hemp clothes and bamboo baskets,” Gurung recalls, “Overall, what these women were doing was impressive, but I was not happy for them because they did not have access to the market. The sustainability of their business was questionable.”
Gurung compared the businesses with Drichu, also led by a woman, and found “it was far successful because it had a market. It was established as a brand.” She then thought about what other enterprises could be appropriate for starting-up women in Nepal. That was the time she remembered the Finnish Baby Box and ordered it.
“Yet, it was clear that I was not going to be an entrepreneur. That was not my cup of tea; I hated maths throughout the school. There was no one in my family from this background,” she says, “I was thinking it for Nepali women in general.” But the ‘shock’ [discussed above] brought her here.
Because the initial idea was empowering women, Gurung says she has been keeping it at the centre. “During my research, I found that many prisoners, including many women, are involved in weaving cotton, but they did not have sufficient market. Hence, I approached the Central Jail in Kathmandu for cooperation and we have become a market for them till today.”
Kokroma employs six tailors, all women, and Gurung claims she pays them a ‘fair wage’.
‘Not a bed of roses’
While Gurung believes in a fair pay policy, it seems her products sold well from day one. “Nope, they didn’t,” Gurung laughs before immediately wearing a  sad mask on her face, “The first days were as frustrating as hell. By December 2018, we made 20 sets but no one purchased it. Then I approached my relatives.”
“One afternoon in February this year, I went to a relative with my set. She didn’t like it. I got disappointed.” Gurung went to a coffee shop in Bauddha “just to cool down.” She had the rejected apparel set in her hand.
“At the cafe, beside me appeared a foreign lady who asked me what I was carrying. I explained it to her. She listened to me carefully and gave me her email address, suggesting I could write to her if I would ever need any financial support for the project,” the woman recalls, “I didn’t believe. A five-minute meeting cannot lead you to any fund. Nevertheless, I wrote to her.”
The Kokroma team frequently has fun during work, claims Gurung.
After a few days, she got the response, a commitment to provide USD 15,000 as a grant in different instalments. Cristina Henriquez from the US has provided her USD 6,000 so far. Gurung hired her first staff and purchased seven secondhand sewing machines with Henriquez’ support. So far, in total, Gurung has spent around two million (USD 20,000 approximately) in the business.
In the meantime, Wornell, the Finnish filmmaker, helped her promote the products in the international market. He also designed the brand’s website and other publicity materials. Today, Gurung considers Wornell her mentor and an integral part of the team. The sexagenarian is living in Nepal for the next two years to study Nepali language, and she hopes to ‘exploit’ his expertise during this period for Kokroma’s promotion.
After passing through depressing days, Kokroma has just been a self-sustaining business, Gurung claims, adding her monthly revenue is Rs 200,000 whereas monthly expense amounts to around Rs 100,000 these days.
“But, there are still many challenges for startups,” Gurung says adding Nepali customers think that made-in-Nepal products should be cheaper than the imported ones irrespective of the quality.  “The customers do not recognise and respect local brands and we want to change it.”

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/this-72-year-old-rides-his-bike-nine-hours-a-day-because-he-loves-working.html,"Mangal Man Maharjan ferries passengers on his motorbike, around nine hours every day.
Call Mangal Man Maharjan and he will ask ‘where are you?’ before you tell him who you are and why you are calling.
Like hundreds of motorcyclists working for ride-sharing apps Tootle and Pathao in Nepal, Maharjan is accustomed to asking your location every time you call. But, he is strikingly different from most of the riders.
Seventy-two is past the retirement age for most Nepalis, but septuagenarian Maharjan works nine hours every day.
However, he does not have any compulsion to earn living for his family; his children are all grown up and they have been supporting him.
So why does this man ride to ferry people from here to there every day?
The youthful old man
Maharjan looks too old to be a ‘professional’ biker–his hairs are grey and he has already lost many of his teeth. Yet, he tries to show himself ‘young’ to suit the profession: he regularly colours his hair. More importantly, perhaps, an inner zeal makes his face glow.
It was not his hair colour or wrinkled face that posed challenges to his decision to join the job. But, his unfamiliarity with smartphones certainly became an issue. Initially, he feared that he could not do it.
Mangal Man Maharjan learned to use a smartphone from his grandson.
“I even did not know how to answer a call on such phones,” Maharjan says opening Pathao app on his cell, “But my grandson helped me.”
Chronic traffic jams are another challenge for him, but Maharjan has already learned not to lose patience. Whenever he is caught in congestion, he explores if there are alternative routes.
The alley that leads to Maharjan’s house in Ghattekulo of Kathmandu is quite narrow, so he is used to passing through confined paths.
The alley that leads to Maharjan’s house in Ghattekulo of Kathmandu is quite narrow.
Further, it is his experience that has helped him get ready for the job. He worked as a driver for the entire youth of his life. In the first 17 years, he drove trucks. Then, he worked as a night bus driver on different routes.
While driving the bus, Maharjan once got an opportunity to work as a chauffeur for a chief justice of the Supreme Court. That was not a permanent job but Maharjan was content with it because he thought being the chief justice’s chauffeur was more respectful than being a truck driver. “But, the wife of my boss began nagging me as if she was paying for me. That made me quit,” he remembers.
Following that, Maharjan bought a taxi and began driving it. For whatever reason, he gave up that also after three years. He joined a paint shop as a driver again.
One day, he was caught by a traffic police staffer for a minor road discipline issue. He was fined Rs 500. When he asked the employer to give him the money, the employer said, “I won’t pay the next time.”

Maharjan felt that the employer’s statement hurt his dignity and instantly replied, “Okay sir, I will not drive your vehicle the next day.”
He briefly worked for a doctor but left again after realising that his employer was not happy with him.
So why riding again?
“When I left my last job, I slept at home for three days–because I had nothing to do. But, I was restless on the fourth day; I felt my body ached. The longer you sleep, the more your body hurts,” Maharjan says he was tired of passivity.
From the next day, he began spending the entire afternoon with his pet bird, a nightingale. He was happy with it, but he was not satisfied.

Around the same time, he learned about Pathao.
A few days later, he shared with his family, “I want to register myself as a Pathao rider.” There are four other members in his family: a son, two daughters-in-law and a grandson. His wife died 12 years ago whereas the elder son is in Dubai for work.
“I thought the rider’s job would give me some money whereas I can kill my time easily. Then, you would get a sound sleep. No tension!” It has been around five months since he joined the job.
Maharjan’s daily routine changed since then. He wakes up at 4, takes his favourite breakfast of suji haluwa (a semolina dish), eggs and tea. Then he feeds the pet bird before leaving for the job at around 7. Maharjan does not have anyone to order him how long he should work every day, but he usually takes the last passenger before 4 in the afternoon.

“How old are you?” is the most frequently asked question for Maharjan these days. Some of the ride-sharers tell stories about elderly members of their families. “My dad is also of your age, but he is hospitalised now… my dad cannot walk well, but you drive perfectly… Some of them take selfies with me. They love me, respect me,” he smiles.
“My family also doesn’t like me working,” he says, “They tell me, ‘no more work, stay at home’. But, I love working. I will continue working as long as I can.”",/lifestyle,"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 04:16:17 +0000"

As you pass by the misty Kanyam tea gardens in the Ilam District of eastern Nepal, you will come across bunches of hard cheese hanging in most of the shops.
The hard cheese, known locally as chhurpi, is made from milk collected from naks (female yaks), cows and chauris (a cross between yaks and local hill cows). An excellent source of protein, people throughout the Himalayan region, including Tibet, Darjeeling and Sikkim, and Bhutan, love this hard-to-chew cheese.
However, chhurpi is now a favoured food for dogs in the United States and Europe:

— Yeti Dog Chew (@YetiDogChew) August 16, 2019

According to the Nepal government’s Trade and Export Promotion Centre, in the fiscal year 2017/18, the country exported more than 800 million Nepalese Rupees (US $7 million) worth of chhurpi. According to local businessmen, about 60-70 percent of the chhurpi exported as dog chew to the United States and Europe is produced in the Ilam district itself.

Most cheese varieties tend to be soft, how do they harden this cheese? After collection, the milk is boiled and the fat removed. They then separate the solids from the milk, wrap them in a jute bag to squeeze out the water from the chhurpi, and dry it by putting it out in the sun or by hanging it over a fire.
Godawari International Private Limited, which exports chhurpi as dog chew to India, Japan, Taiwan, Canada, and the United States, explains its rigorous manufacturing process:
[…] Once the milk has cooled down, it is treated with 10 ml of lime juice and 10 mg salt for about 100 gallons of milk. The sour of the mild acid coagulates the milk and the salt speeds up the process. The solids are then separated using a burlap sac [sic], which is washed several times using warm water to remove the whey, and any hints of salt and lime juice.
The solids in the burlap sack are then subjected to squeezing for about 3 weeks when the cake obtained contains at most 5% moisture. The cakes are pressed using weights to remove the excess moisture.
The cake is then cut to size and prepared for cooking [sic] under the sun and smoke[d] for 2-3 months. […]

The idea to market chhurpis as dog food came from brothers Suman and Sujan Shrestha who, together with Nishes Shrestha, started the company Himalayan Dog Chew in 2003. The idea was sparked when one of the brothers noticed a dog gnawing at a chhurpi. In 2007, they launched their product at a pet fair in Bellingham, Washington. Since then, the company has come a long way: it is currently the largest exporter of Himalayan cheese out of Nepal, employing more than 9,000 people. In 2015, these three Nepali entrepreneurs appeared on the popular American TV show Shark Tank, even though they were already making over US $5 million in sales a year.
Many other companies have since followed their lead, but Himalayan Dog Chew has now diversified, evolving from a single product-oriented business into a full pet supply company. According to its website, the company now proudly partners with a third-generation dairy farm in Washington State, which produces 10 million pounds of milk per month and over 124 million pounds per year, all for Himalayan Pet Supply.
Since this hard cheese is being exported to so many countries, including Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States, its manufacture has become a regular source of income for Nepal’s rural farmers.
To stay afloat in the market, however, manufacturers and exporters need to make sure they keep re-engineering and diversifying the product:

As per the company’s advisory, the chews might cause choking, indigestion, blockage and breakage of teeth and so advise constant supervision of dogs during consumption.

It is quite unusual for villagers of remote Bajura district as they see 18 people from diverse backgrounds, from youth to senior citizens, busy collecting the field data using the GPS (global positioning system) and smartphones.
But recently, the locals of Budhiganga municipality of the district got trained recently to digitally map their resources, landmarks and upload them on the global open platforms called OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap is a global initiative to create a complete map contributed by the volunteers which are freely available for everyone to use in the future.
“We wish to create a task force who are readily available to map their own area whenever needed, we are confident that this will contribute to addressing the data gaps and will be crucial in the context of new federal structure,” says Uttam Pudasaini, a leader of the team who trained locals in Bajhang and Bajura districts.
Confident locals
Participants showed great enthusiasm to map their areas as the results were visible instantly online. The experts’ team had remotely mapped whole areas of Bajhang and Bajura beforehand. Some information from the remote map about two municipalities was validated by the participants who collected the field-based data. A total of 41 locals from the two districts participated in the training and made contributions to the validation.

Mira Kumari Joshi, an information technology officer in Khaptad Chhededaha rural municipality, was one of these participants. She says, “We face many difficulties due to unavailability of the digital information about our region and now we are confident that we will be able to map our own area and use this to fulfil our own needs.”
Likewise, Khadak Singh Bista, a local school principal, says, “These kinds of technical skills need to be transferred to the local communities, which could greatly contribute to supporting local level developmental efforts”.
Support for development planning
With the new federal structure in place, the local units seem to be suffering from data deficiency and they have to start it over from level zero. Most of the municipalities are still in the process of producing their municipality profile. Most importantly, if someone wishes to visit the municipality and ward offices from outside, their location is not available online. The only way is to ask local people about the location and rely on them, which sometimes might not be accurate.

During the fieldwork in Bajhang and Bajura, this team found out that even the government authorities like ward offices were not digitally mapped and it was very difficult to find the location for outsiders and even for the community people.
Hence, Deepak Shah, mayor of the Budhiganga municipality, states, “These kinds of information are important in making the development plans and also tracking the road development in the area”.
Information for resilience
Bajura is considered to be one of the most disaster-prone districts of the country. It is impacted by a diverse range of disasters. The situation is exacerbated by the impacts of global environmental changes. In this context, location-based information can play an important role during emergencies in this age of technology.

In cases of humanitarian emergencies, this information will be crucial as the information about key services including health posts, financial services, first aid, and the security forces are available online, for free. Also, if any humanitarian actors wish to use this information for planning any activities, these data can be very helpful.  The community-mapped open spaces can also be used for evacuation, safe shelters and spots for landing helicopters during emergency situations.
On September 16, 2019, the Sanphe-Martadi road section at Balde of Budhiganga municipality in Bajura was blocked due to a massive landslide. There were many other active landslides in the districts, not mapped and located. With this mapping effort, some of the major landslides have been mapped and are available online. Most importantly, local people have been empowered to fill the data gap in the future.",/lifestyle,"Thu, 05 Dec 2019 04:44:47 +0000"

What is a ‘sarauto’ anyway? Arguably, many Nepali cinemagoers of the young generation are not familiar with the term. Making a movie with such a difficult word in the title and featuring a non-star cast is really a risky affair. However, the producers dared to do it and the movie is already on the screen now.
This week’s Kollywood release might exceed your expectations you may have set considering its strange title. Even with the non-star team, debutant director Hari Humagain has done an impressive job.
Raghav Krishna Gautam’s intriguing story and dialogues compensate for the so-so acting and overall presentation of the movie. Despite several flaws, the movie keeps most members of the audience hooked, and it deserves applause as the majority of contemporary Nepali ‘action’ films are boring and unsubstantial.
Action with love story and family drama    
First, be clear that Sarauto is not only an action movie; it is also an emotional love story and a family drama. This is the first reason why this movie can offer you something more than what you have expected.
Nepali action movies have not received good reviews in the past. They are found to be imitating Bollywood action patterns, but failing to meet the standard. Sarauto might not be any exception.
However, the action is not the only thing that you can look forward to in this movie. It also has a beautiful, though tragic, love story, and heightened family conflict. These elements enable the movie to appeal to different groups of the audience, for different reasons.

Sarauto’s love story is unique. The way that the heroine (Sumi Moktan) and the hero (Sunny Singh) meet is quite common, but the way they develop their intimacy is arguably peculiar. (Further description of this ‘way’ could be a spoiler!) Like other love story movies, this film also includes a couple of songs. However, the songs essentially do not contribute anything to the overall impact of the movie.
The movie also offers you an emotionally-charged family drama. This is not as beautiful as the love story, because it has a bias. The movie reinforces a prejudiced idea about adopted children of the family (again, a further description of this argument should not be revealed here). But, notwithstanding the bias, the drama is worth watching.
This film obviously includes other regular components of an action movie: revenge, betrayal, fight, and bloodsheds. If you love foreign action movies and want to see how Nepali filmmakers are also learning tricks of the genre, go watch it and judge on your own.
Cinematic presentation
Because the movie’s director is an experienced cinematographer, the movie’s visual language clearly communicates its message. As the plot moves between the past and the present, several flashback scenes are included in the movie. The chronological (present) and flashback (past) scenes have been effectively connected into a sequence hence there is not much confusion.
Nevertheless, a few incidents from the past–for example, the heroine’s conversation with her dad about ‘the greatest thing in life’–are repeated many times, and it might force the audience to lose their interest. Likewise, some flashback scenes, for example Jeetjung (Leo Tank) narrating his past and his transformation into a villain, are too quick.

Moreover, the first half of the movie baffles you. You see three parallel storylines. All of them merge into the one some minutes before the intermission. Because you can easily understand the development of events since then, the plot can become more interesting.
The writer and the director have tried to make some scenes symbolic, but they do not work much effectively. In the movie’s trailer, you can see the hero expressing a metaphor of rivers and bridges about human separations and connections. This does not appeal much as it is already used too much.
The biggest symbols used in the movie are the ‘sarauto’ an ‘Om’-sign locket. The sarauto symbolism is quite clear, neither is it problematic for the tool is associated with the antagonist forces. But there is a big problem with the Om locket. Because the sign is a common symbol of Hinduism, the movie using it to refer to the villain is offensive and insensitive to the biggest religious group of the country.
Acting
As the lead, Sumi Moktan has done a nice job. Her acting is not perfect, but she has left an impression and shown the potential of further development in the field. Her male counterpart, Sunny Singh is also commendable. He is cool, gentle and handsome as demanded by his role. He has been seen natural all the time, even when he acts drinking, and it is his biggest strength. Parakram PJB Rana as the hero’s confidant has also proved his capacity in acting. In his debuting project, Leo Tank (Tanka Dhamala) has also made since efforts to act alive though at times his acting looks immature and artificial. He, of course, has space for improvement, but he must have caught other directors’ eye for a villain’s role in the future. Sampada Dahal cannot shine much.

Among the artists playing supporting roles, Aruna Karki and Vijaya Lama’s performance is memorable. However, it is not only because of their long experiences, but also due to the positive roles they are given. Dhiren Shakya and Yubaraj Lama are average.
Verdict
Though promoted as an action movie, Sarauto’s story is more appealing than the action. It deserves your two hours and a quarter, plus a ticket of a few hundred rupees.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/why-everyone-needs-to-worry-about-first-case-of-malaria-parasites-in-nepali-buffalos.html,"File: A buffalo farm in Nepal
Nepali zoologists have reported the first case of the malaria parasite in water buffalos in Nepal. The alarming discovery places thousands of farmers who rear buffalos and their cattle across the country at risk.
Scientists, who uncovered the presence of the hitherto unnoticed parasites, say besides farmers, the non-farming urban group is also at risk, almost equally. Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation’s Deputy Director-General Ram Chandra Kandel, who led the research in 2017, informs that buffalo meat-eaters in the urban areas constitute the most vulnerable group in Nepal. “Multiple studies have found out that eating meat from diseased animals can cause various ailments.”
The finding
Interestingly, the study was not carried out as an independent research project. It was a by-product of Kandel’s PhD research. “My primary concern, for the PhD, was threats to wild water buffalos in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve caused by the assimilation of domestic buffalos with the wild buffalos,” he says, “In the process; I wanted to see major diseases troubling them.”
To find out the presence of diseases in the animal, Kandel mobilised a team of other scientists to conduct the study, who hinted that the animals could be suffering from malaria.
The team collected blood samples from 56 water buffalos including 16 wild, 23 feral and 17 domestic. Of 16 wild buffalos, 13 were from the wildlife reserve whereas three were captives of the central zoo of Nepal. The domestic and feral buffalos were taken from human settlements outside the wildlife reserve. In total, three were 32 female and 24 male buffalos. Whereas the team could not identify the age of 18 buffalos, the other 38 were 15-day to 15-year-old.
During the study, one feral and one domestic buffalo were found to be contaminated with malaria parasites. “This is just four percent of our sample size, but given the implications and the lack of measures to control further expansion, it is a serious threat,” claims Kandel.
The risk
Citing similar studies for other diseases in other countries, he further added that the impacts of such meat on human health can pass onto the next generations also. “It seems one mouthful of a ‘buff’ momo that you eat can hit many generations.” He says many people cannot properly identify the causes of their diseases these days, but they fail to notice such petty issues such as where the momo meat comes from.”
File: Momo
Though Kandel says he does not have any specific examples about a malaria-infected buffalo meat causing health risks to humans, he seems convinced given the level of ‘carelessness’ of Nepali people about such issues.
“There are reports of bird flu almost every year in Nepal, but many people do not seem to be bothered about it anyway. The price pf chicken drops as household consumers choose not to eat chicken after such reports,” he says, “But you go to the restaurants in your neighbourhood and you find that chicken momos are equally popular notwithstanding the infection.”
Farmers’ fears
Malaria is apparently a non-communicable disease; there is no way that the cattle can spread it to farmers directly. However, the discovery of malaria in buffalos is a hint that the atmosphere that farmers are living in is prone to the infection and it affects the humans equally, according to the researcher.
Most farmers of Nepal keep their cattle close-by. In many cases, the cowsheds are within the same house that the farmers live in, which is not a problem. “But, you know how the farmers rear the animals?” Kandel explains, “The cowsheds are dirty. The manure is not removed on time. Ultimately, the places of cattle turn out to be hubs for the mosquitoes, the vectors of malaria.”
“The farmers do not care about their own health. How can we expect them to care about the animals and keep the place clean?” he questions before saying, “But, we need to realise that the risks for the animals are also the risks for people.”
On the other hand, malaria kills the cattle untimely or weakens them physically. It causes a huge economic loss to the farmers.

Remedies
The researcher suggests that different measures can be adopted at different levels to address the problems likely to be caused by the malaria parasites in buffalos. “At the domestic level, farmers should pay proper attention to cleanliness and hygiene of the animals. The cattle should be given a regular bath in clean water whereas they also need to stay covered from mosquito bites.”
As no malaria case was found in the wild buffalos during the study, Kandel claims domestic animals are at greater risk, hence improving the way farmers rear the cattle can be a great help.
At the next level, the country needs to improve animal quarantine because the risk of malaria is higher in India than in Nepal. The world’s first case of malaria in a water buffalo was reported in India whereas different recent studies covering Nagpur, Bareilly/Muktesar and Maharashtra have also indicated higher risks. Likewise, other Asian countries such as Vietnam and Thailand also have higher rates of infection, according to Kandel’s report. It is hence significant to tighten the quarantine checking, according to him.
Moreover, other animals might also be suffering from the disease but sufficient research has not been done. Kandel is aware that the sample size of his research was relatively small and should not be generalised to cause terror among farmers and stakeholders. Rather, additional studies should be carried out to determine the severity of malaria in animals of Nepal and plan a coping strategy accordingly, he recommends.",/lifestyle,"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 05:07:58 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/does-your-body-need-potassium.html,"
Potassium? You may have heard about it but cannot precisely put your finger on it.  Physicians advise on taking 3,500 to 4,700 mg of potassium daily. WHO (the World Health Organization), too, recommends an intake of 3,510 mg per day.  Hang on, this does not mean you pop into your mouth a potassium pill every day! Plenty of food is loaded with this mineral compound to help you meet your daily requirements.
Our body to function properly needs diverse nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water. They are essential for the growth of our bone, flesh, organs, and to maintain body metabolism. What’s more, we need them to keep the diseases at bay and retain overall good health. Potassium as a macro-mineral fulfills one of those essential nutrients.
Mineral electrolyte
Electrolytes are essential minerals found in blood, sweat and urine. Minerals such as sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and potassium form the electrolytes much needed by our body.
Imbalance of electrolytes in the body is caused when we lose fluids as a result of persistent vomiting or diarrhea, sweating or fever. Other causes include: Medications such as steroids, diuretics and laxatives.
 Surprisingly, nearly 80% of the potassium is found in our body cells in the form of fluids like blood, sweat, and plasma. The rest is stored in our bones and liver. 
Biomedical scientists explain that potassium, as an agent, on one hand, regulates the fluid balance in our body and on the other controls the electrical activity of the heart and body muscles. In short, it helps the cellular and electrical functions of our body.
Potassium aids our nerves to function, the muscles to contract, maintain a regular heartbeat, pump nutrients into our body cells and chuck waste products out of them. 
As a mineral electrolyte, this wonderful compound cuts down on the high sodium content in our body. It is said to minimize the risk of stroke, high blood pressure, and the formation of kidney stones. It supports cardiovascular health, safeguards muscle mass and preserves the mineral density in our bones.
Potassium deficiency
Surprisingly, the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, USA) in a survey called NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) revealed a mind-boggling fact that in the United States alone a whopping 98 percent of people fail to meet the daily requirement of 3,500 to 4,700 mg of potassium.
Catherine Collins, a dietician at the St George’s Hospital, Tooting London sheds light on potassium by saying, “We use it to help generate an electrical charge which helps the cell function properly. It helps keep your heart rate steady, it helps trigger insulin release from the pancreas to help control blood sugars, and more importantly, keeps blood pressure in check.”
When the potassium level in our blood is low it’s called hypokalemia. The common symptoms of hypokalemia are fatigue, malaise, muscle aches/cramps, digestive disorder, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, irregular palpitation, numbness of body parts and breathing problem, among others.
Severe potassium deficiency occurs when an adult’s potassium level falls below 3.6 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). In such cases, apart from the symptoms mentioned above, others include low blood pressure, paralysis (as a result of muscle weakness) and respiratory failure.  A simple blood test can give you your exact potassium level.

The role of kidneys
While doing the research work for this write-up I met Dr. Rabin Nepali, who kindly shed light on the role of kidneys vis-à-vis potassium. To quote Dr. Rabin: “The dietary intake of potassium ranges from less than 35 to more than 110 mmol/day in U.S. adults.”
“Despite this widespread variation in intake, homeostatic mechanisms serve to maintain plasma potassium precisely between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L. In a healthy individual at steady state, the entire daily intake of potassium is excreted, approximately 90% in the urine and 10% in the stool.”
Dr Rabin Nepali
“More than 98% of total body potassium is intracellular, chiefly in muscle. The rapid exchange of intracellular potassium with extracellular potassium plays a crucial role in maintaining plasma potassium within such a narrow range; this is accomplished by overlapping and synergistic regulation of a number of renal and extra-renal transport pathways.”
“So, kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining a steady state in potassium metabolism, by excreting excess potassium or reabsorbing it as required by the body.” (Dr. Rabin Nepali, DM Nephrology, Asst. Professor, Teaching Hospital, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu).
Food and not supplements
Yes, do not get taken in by supplements although you are tempted. There are one too many that you can buy over the counter.  Go for dietary sources. There is abundant food brimming with potassium. Not processed food, though as they are high in sodium.
Doctors of medicine argue that natural diets rich in potassium is linked with a lower risk of hypertension (high blood pressure), kidney stones and osteoporosis. Our daily food like meat, poultry, fish, fruits, nuts, and vegetables not only pack various nutrients but also serve as an excellent source of potassium.

Beverages such as milk, coffee and other nonalcoholic drinks too contain a liberal amount of potassium. Let’s take a look at the following chart:
Selected Food Sources of Potassium 
Source: https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/
 
Among the foods highest in potassium are said to be beet greens, white beans, soybeans, and Lima beans.

The benefits of potassium include:
Blood pressure and cardiovascular health
Today, hypertension or high blood pressure has become a commonplace health problem among old and young alike. If not addressed on time, it can lead to grave complications like stroke and heart disease.
Sodium or salt, for one, is closely related to high blood pressure and the doctor advises to cut down on the intake of salt. Now, potassium is said to neutralize to a great extent the negative effects of sodium.
Our kidneys aid to keep our blood pressure in control. They put the amount of fluid stored in our body on an even keel. High blood pressure is associated with the increase in fluid in our bodies. Eating a potassium-rich diet negates the effect of sodium and helps the kidneys to restore the balance—as such, lowering the blood pressure to a healthy level.
Clinicians believe a diet high in potassium can help cut systolic blood pressure by more than 10 counts in people with high blood pressure.  
Talking about heart health, according to WHO, 17.9 million people worldwide die of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) that includes coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and others. Four out of five CVD deaths fall under heart attacks and strokes.
WHO recommends an increase in potassium intake from food (not refined food) to reduce blood pressure and cut down the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart disease. Potassium helps reduce vascular calcification, or to simply put it, mineral deposits on the walls of our arteries and veins. These mineral deposits develop into plaques, thus, increasing the risk of stroke and blood clots.
In a study carried out by medical experts, it was found that “those who consumed 4,069 mg of potassium per day had a 49 percent lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease compared with those who consumed about 1,000 mg per day.”
Diabetes
Diabetes has turned into a growing problem. The soaring prevalence of diabetes is also referred to as “the epidemic of the century.” Once considered to be most common with older people, today, affects younger adults too owing to sedentary lifestyle and diet.
According to IDF (International Diabetes Federation), in 2017, the world diabetes figure remained approximately 425 million adults (20-79 years). IDF further stated that by 2045 the figure might rise to a staggering 629 million.
Studies made by health care professionals have come to new findings that lower levels of potassium in the body are also associated with a higher risk of diabetes. 
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at a high risk of ESRD (kidney failure or end-stage renal disease) and CVD (cardiovascular disease), both of which can result in life-threatening complications.
A research made by Dr. Shin-ichi Araki and several of his co-researchers for the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology claimed that diets rich in potassium may help protect the heart and kidney health of patients with type 2 diabetes.
The experiment was participated in by 623 Japanese with type 2 diabetes.  The trial ran from 1996 to 2003 with a median follow-up period of 11 years. The results showed that higher levels of potassium in the participants’ urine showed a lower risk of renal dysfunction and cardiovascular problems.
Bone and muscle maintenance
A diet high in potassium is closely related to bone health. Potassium-rich foods generate alkali in the body to maintain acid-base balance. High intake of protein-rich foods or acidifying foods such as meat, dairy products, and processed cereals creates acidosis in our bodies, which have a negative effect on our bones and muscles.
Metabolic acidosis causes excretion of nitrogen resulting in loss of bone mineral density, and muscle wasting. On the other hand, potassium-dense food like vegetables and fruits helps neutralize the adverse effects of acidosis build-up in our body. Older people, too, are benefitted by eating potassium-rich food like fruits and vegetables, which preserve their muscle mass and enhance bone density as well.
Caveat
The intake of Potassium, as prescribed by a health care professional, is very beneficial to our overall health. Care should be taken, however, not to exceed the recommended dose of 4,700mg per day.
Individuals with no health problems may easily rid their bodies off the excess amounts through their urine with no adverse effects. Food-related potassium toxicity is considered a rarity but excessive consumption can lead to a complication called hyperkalemia. Our body cannot do without potassium. But it does not need it in excess. The kidneys come to the rescue and reject the unwanted potassium from the blood.
In the case of kidney disease, excess potassium can prove dangerous as the kidneys fail to remove the extra potassium, which stays in the blood cells. This can have grave results, even life-threatening ones and the condition is called hyperkalemia.
All health care providers always advise against an extremely high intake of potassium, especially in such patients who have dysfunctional kidney problems and are on supplements. Potassium levels between 5.1 and 6.0 mmol/L are considered high and need immediate consultation. Levels higher than 6.0 mmol/L are dangerous.
Beetroot
Bottom line
Diet and not supplements are the best source of potassium to meet your body’s requirement. “Let food be thy medicine, and let medicine be thy food.” Those words were said by the ancient Greek founder of western medicine, Hippocrates of Kos, during the Greek Classical Period in the 5th century BC.
No truer words have ever been said, which sounds right to this day. Eat right, stay healthy!

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/this-nepali-zoologist-gave-his-name-to-a-snake-now-he-is-concerned-about-peoples-perception-of-the-reptile.html,"Trimeresurus karanshahi. Photo courtesy: Karan Bahadur Shah
Like other children of his neighbourhood, Karan Bahadur Shah was afraid of snakes. At the age of 10, his family migrated to the plains of Kanchanpur from Dadeldhura, and the fear of snakes heightened because more snakebite cases were reported there.
“The fear persisted till I was doing my master’s in zoology in the 20s,” the sexagenarian says, “But later, I developed an affinity towards this reptile because I wanted to do something new in my field.”
Around two decades ago, this pioneer herpetologist discovered a new snake species, and the scientific community named the species after him, an unprecedented achievement in the field of zoology in Nepal. Content with the feat, Shah, now, has a more serious concern–he feels that humans have not understood the importance of snakes. “They rather perceive the serpents as their enemies and kill many of them every year,” he says.
The Phulchoki finding
Since he began studying zoology, Shah was intrigued by snakes. “The number of snake species in Nepal was far less than the number of snake species in India. But I thought Nepal too should be home to at least half of the Indian species because the two countries have similar geographic and climatic conditions.”
As Shah tried his hand at the study of snakes, he got into contact with many scholars from different parts of the world. “During that time, many foreigners would come to Nepal to study various species. The government would allow them to take to other countries the animals and plants they found in Nepal for study,” he says.
It was during the 1996 late monsoon. Shah was hosting a team of international snake researchers. “We went to hills around Kathmandu almost every night for several days,” he recalls, “Then, we decided to do it in the daytime for a few days because it was raining frequently and we thought the snakes would come out in the sun to warm themselves.”
That particular day (he does not remember the date), Shah hired two vehicles for his team to travel up to Godavari in the early morning. They had planned to walk up to Phulchoki hill. His teenage son, Utkrisht, also showed interest in the trip as his school was closed that day.
“But he could not catch up with the adults so I had to leave my friends and walk with him,” he narrates, “I almost forgot my research work as I was busy talking to him. But coming down, something unexpected happened.”
It was past 10 am. The clouds had cleared and the sun had just emerged from the horizon. “Suddenly, I saw a green snake in front of me. As I approached it, the snake crawled towards a nearby hole. I ran towards the hole to catch its tail. Fortunately, I managed to bag it.”
Shah thought that it was just a snake belonging to one of five to six green snake species found in Nepal. He joined his colleagues at the Godavari station and told them about the incident. They photographed the serpent.
The snake remained in Shah’s bag for the next few days. After concluding the study for that season, one of the researchers, Nikolai Orlov from Russia proposed that he take the snake captured by Shah along with him. Shah agreed.
“But, he did not tell me anything about the results of the study for the next few months. Later I found that they took time because the characteristics of that snake did not match that of others. Hence, they suspected if it was a new species,” Shah says, “Orlov visited many other places and summoned specimens from other menageries. Finally, they concluded that the snake belonged to a species not recorded yet.”
The nomenclature
Perhaps the discovery was not an achievement in itself. There was something more Shah should have looked forward to.
Orlov and his friend Notker Helfenberger published their analysis of the same in the Russian Journal of Herpetology (Vol. 4, No. 2, 1997). In the article, the two scientists named the new species as Trimeresurus karanshahi. The snake got named ‘Karan’s Pit Viper’ or ‘Shah’s Pit Viper’ in English, and ‘Karanko Hareu’ in Nepali. The researchers explained, “The species is named after Nepali herpetologist Karan B Shah, whose organising support was principal for realising the expedition” (sic).
Shah felt he was on cloud nine when he received a copy of the journal. He felt his dream “of doing something new” come true as no Nepali zoologist had been able to put his/her name after any species till then. Shah claims there is still no one in zoology who had achieved a similar feat till date though there are some in botany.
Shah believes having his name associated with a species is important because not everyone can achieve that despite discovering new species. “It’s not up to you to name the species you discover. Other researchers should acknowledge your contribution to the discovery, in a scientific journal recognised across the world,” he says. Besides, a number of naming systems exist in the field. It is up to the authors to name the new species after people, places or other characteristics.
Recognising the achievement, the government of Nepal published a postal stamp featuring Karan’s pit viper the next year.
Karan’s pit viper on a postal stamp
Critical concerns
Despite achieving such a ‘celebrated’ status in academia, Shah is not happy with people’s perception of snakes. He says the snakes should not be killed just because of some snakebite incidents.
“We need to understand is that all snakes are not venomous. In fact, only 10 percent of snakes are capable of injecting venom into other living bodies,” he says, “Secondly, all snakebite do not cause injury. Around 50 percent of cases are ‘dry bites’ in which the snakes cannot inject venom inside the human bodies.”
Then, people need to understand the contribution of these reptiles to the ecosystem and let them live freely, according to him. Snakes are carnivores and they balance the ecosystem by eating various insects and small mammals. “They also eat rodents. When applying other measures like poisoning and trapping, yourself could be a victim,” he jokes, “Practically, it is safer to let the serpents eat rodents around you.”
Protecting snakes is also necessary because their venom can be used in various medicines, Shah suggests.
However, he is aware of the tragedies that snakebite can cause. Nepal records around 20,000 snakebite incidents every year, and a few dozen people die. But Shah still argues that killing snakes is not a solution.
“Yes, I know. My brother’s grandson was bitten by a snake in Mahendranagar last year while he was asleep inside the home,” he says, “But, before talking about the risks, we need to keep ourselves safe.”
Shah claims snakes do not bite unless they feel threatened. Hence, people should stay away from snakes. However, during the summers, they frequent human residences in the search of cooler places as the surface and underground temperatures increase. Likewise, when it floods, they come to dry places for safety. “Therefore, during high-risk seasons, stay prepared. Keep your doors and windows closed,” he advises, “Whenever you go out, cover the body with sleeved clothes and boots. Carry a torch if you walk in the dark.”
“Seeking help from shamans and traditional healers is a bigger problem than the snakebite itself,” he says, “The Nepal government gives anti-venoms for free in all of its health facilities and they can save your life.”",/lifestyle,"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 05:18:30 +0000"

President Bidya Devi Bhandari’s advisor Sushil Pyakurel has resigned from his position on Friday.
Though Pyakurel, a longtime human rights activist, has not mentioned the reason for his resignation in a press statement issued to inform the media about his decision, it has been learned that he was dissatisfied with the recent decision of ruling Nepal Communist Party’s decision to nominate Agni Prasad Sapkota for the speaker of House of Representatives. Sapkota has been accused of a murder during the armed conflict.
Pyakurel states that he resigned “to contribute to the citizens’ aspirations of maintaining everyone’s equal position in front of the law.” He adds that constitutional bodies should incorporate fundamental values of good governance and promote high political values and ethics.
He had also served as an advisor to the president during her first term before 2015.",/political,"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 09:34:54 +0000"

Kathmandu, January 22
Nearly three months have passed since India published its new political map incorporating the disputed region of Kalapani in its territory, triggering protests in Nepal. As the dispute still awaits a solution, the two governments seem passive.
However, the Nepal government claims it is waiting for India’s response to a diplomatic note it had sent in December last year proposing a meeting to discuss the issue and says it is hopeful of the solution through dialogues.
Nepal had protested India’s political map published in the first week of November, sending its diplomatic note on November 22. In the note, Nepal had proposed a date for a meeting. However, the meeting could not take place as India responded to the note on December 19 only, by when the proposed date was already past.
Following that, Nepal had sent the second note. India is yet to make any response, according to Bharat Raj Paudyal, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
However, the activists who raised concern over the issue in the past are not satisfied with the excuse. Narendra Raj Khanal, one of them, nevertheless, says the activists are searching for new sets of evidence to make Nepal’s position strong in the diplomatic dealing.",/political,"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 04:40:25 +0000"

Kathmandu, January 21
Whereas the government is under fire for introducing controversial Information Technology Bill and the Bill on Special Service that could jeopardise people’s freedom of expression and right to privacy, yet another bill introduced by the government has also drawn a strong objection from a major stakeholder.
Jitram Lama, the president of NGO Federation of Nepal, says the government is trying to gradually close down all nongovernment organisations operating in the country by introducing the Bill on Organisations. The Ministry of Home Affairs has finalised the draft and forwarded it to the Cabinet for further processing.
In an interview with Onlinekhabar, Lama claims the bill would complicate the process of registration and renewal of NGOs and restrict them to a limited scope. “It requires a tax clearance certificate, a recommendation from the concerned local government and police report to register and renew an organisation. It takes months to prepare all of them,” he says, “Do you think members of the organisations like child club, youth club or farmers’ group would have any concern for a tax clearance certificate?”
“Such complicated procedures have been introduced with the intention of stopping them from registration.”
He says the government does not require a business firm to submit a police report for registration, asking why it would be a must for the NGOs. “There are other laws to control crime,” he says, “Everyone should be allowed to enjoy the freedom of association.”
Lama says the federation has concluded that the bill is against sentiments of the constitution and it disrespects the NGOs’ contribution to Nepal’s development, adding, “Indirectly, the government is telling us not to open any organisation and close down the existing ones.”

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/slugging-it-out-on-two-wheels-the-langtang-ride-i.html,"There is nothing like taking a holiday break, to escape the daily grind, the urban chaos, the stifling greenhouse gases, and to say the least to raise your spirits, down in the dumps. Some even like to inject a dose of adventure, too, into such escapades.
For some, it’s just plain sightseeing tours to new places, a pilgrimage or cities. But some are wired differently. Their reading of an adventure is to go off the beaten track, discover the wild and the wacky—something new, fresh, if not, the funkiest. Some even dare to push borders and boundaries.
I happened to know one such swashbuckling duo, Khashing Rai and Shishir Joshi. In 2018, they dared to redefine the concept of conventional trekking by walking bare feet for four consecutive days to Budhinandha Tal, far-west Nepal, Bajura (read the story) to an elevation of 4,600 m with nothing more than Wai Wai (noodles) and chiura (beaten rice) for food, and no warmth of a bed since the deserted trail had no teahouses or lodges. Brave? I thought they were raving mad.
Kyanjin Gompa
Destination Langtang
In 2019, with the Dashain festival around the corner, the duo planned a trip, on wheels (mountain bikes), to the Langtang Valley, which also happens to be a popular trekking destination. Well, in other words, their destination was “the land of the ox.” In Tibetan dialect, ‘Lang’ stands for land, and ‘tang’ translates to an ox.
The valley is also well known for spectacular views of glaciers and needless to write, peerless pastoral beauty. They’d set their sights on Kyangjin Gompa (4,300 m), nestled at the footholds of the iconic peak, the Langtang Lirung. The trip this time did not sound far-out, but it was no picnic.
The gang
The monsoon had not fully dissipated as it came late last year, but that did not matter. The trip was set in stone. The duo this time was to be accompanied by an old compadre Diwash Pradhan and two lady friends,  Anamika Ghothane (Gurung) and Rojisha Limbu, both in their early twenties. Diwash and Khashing had done a ride with me to Upper Mustang in October 2018.
Anamica and Rojisha are registered nurses by profession. Although they have been riding their mountain bikes for the last four years, this was their first-ever tough ride on a gnarly terrain that included rocks, washouts, ruts, loose sand, loose gravel, steep slopes, and impossible inclines. What’s more, the trip included more than 40 percent lugging on extreme inclines, and steep gradients.
Khashing, as the team leader, had briefed every member of the team of the possible hardships and also warned them, especially the women, about the shouldering the bikes. Anamica and Rojisha appeared resolute. They did not even bat an eyelid when Khashing put in the bare facts. Tough as old boots, Shishir did not care. Diwash, not used to technical riding, seemed a little uncertain. “What of it, if the ladies can do it, why can’t I?” he mused.
As it turned out, Shishir changed his mind at the last hour. He said he’d trek instead. Very like him, always unpredictable. He wanted to explore further to the Gan Jala Pass (5,300 m). Coincidentally, the cycling route the group was doing from Syabru Besi to Kyanjin Gompa was the same. The route went further from the gompa to highlands like Tserko Ri and finally the Gan Jala Pass, a key trekking destination in the Langtang region.
Shishir decided he’d tag along with his cycling comrades on foot, help the ladies out on tough sections, and then part company after Kyanjin Gompa. Sounded very out of the ordinary, but not unlike Shishir, though. Catching up with the cyclists for him was a breeze as the terrain was virtually grueling uphill, and the push-and-carry made the ride nothing short of a snail-pace.
To Syabru Besi
After month-long planning, the group finally left for Syabru Besi (also Syaphru Besi) in the second week of September 2019. The trip was scheduled for a week. The buses to Shyabru Besi had changed the usual route from Jhor or Kakani to the Galchhi-Devighat highway (as both the old highways were in bad shape). The road after Galchhi (a point of Prithvi Highway), went along the Trishuli River to Nuwakot with Devighat en-route.
The scheduled buses shuttled the travellers from Machhapokhari, Balaju Bypass. For the first-timer, the bus park can be a nasty surprise to watch the chaotic fuss.
Khashing looked worried that the bumpy ride might ruin the bicycles loaded on the roof of the bus. It reminded him of the Upper Mustang trip mishap when one of the bicycles had a tyre slashed open by some sharp object on the bus-roof.
 

He made it a point to keep checking as the bus stopped at Thade Dhunche, and Thulo Barkhu until they finally arrived at the kick-off point of their trip, Syabru Besi (2,380 m), Rasuwa district.
Layover
As the small but busy town nestled at the base of soaring hills on three sides, the Bhote Koshi tumbled down by its side, making quite a rumble. Mostly hotels and teashops lined the main bazaar. To their surprise, the crowd happened to include more backpack toting foreign tourists, milling around the street, than the locals. After checking into a roadside lodge and a little refreshment, the gang took a stroll along the street.

By and by,  at a  tea stall, over a cup of tea, they overheard a fellow talking about a hot spring very close to the lodge, they’d put up. They decided to have a look-see.  It took them hardly a half-an-hour to get to the spot, located at the confluence of the Langtang Khola and the Bhote Koshi. But nobody relished the idea of taking a dip as the water looked sullied.
At the hot spring, Shyabru Besi. Looks the guys are pointing at Khashing up to some pranks.
 
To Sherpa Gaun
After a layover at the lodge, the group warmed up for the ride the next morning. The destination for the day was Sherpa Gaun, nine kilometres away. Yes, everybody looked excited, Anamica and Rojisha the most. They just could not wait to hop on to their saddles. If Khashing appeared engrossed as the skipper, Diwash seemed a little apprehensive. Shishir remained cool as a cucumber. He gave the ladies a tip or two about the proper handling of the bike on rough trails.
Sherpa Gaun from a distance
As it turned out, the dirt track was not easy sailing. A recent landslip seemed to have strewn the track with rocky debris.
Howzat! Khashing flirting with the camera with one of his jocular stances.
It was time to stop for breakfast. The group chose a teahouse by the bank of the Langtang River.  As the turquoise water tumbled south over rocks and boulders creating white feathers, the fast current formed foam-lipped eddies near the banks. The opposite bank rose to lush towering hills.
So far, so good. No hitch-ups, up until then. Everybody did their best. Shishir did well to keep pace on foot. The lunch was scheduled for Khangjim. After a filling breakfast, a little breather, and having feasted on the pristine landscape, the group stretched themselves up to hop onto their saddles.
The bicycles take a break as the group members grab their breakfast
 After breaking a sweat for something like three hours, they sighted a small habitation, the pit stop for lunch. “That’s Khangjim,” announced Khashing. Time for lunch. Everybody went for the cherished dal-bhat. That reminds me of my 12-day cycling tour to the Upper Mustang when the all-time favourite for our group for lunch was dal-bhat, each day, hands down. Dal-bhat was a reasonable Rs 150.00 (veg). Non-veg was Rs 200.00. “The charges here for lunch is much cheaper than what we paid in Mustang, guys,” commented Diwash, looking a little surprised.
A brief respite
After a brief respite, the group was all set to spin. “On to Sherpa Gaun, our stopover for the day, guys,” called out Khashing. The expected time of arrival at Sherpa Gaun was nearly three hours away. Most of the tracks were rideable but going uphill. The lush vegetation gradually was being replaced by bare hills and scrubland as they gained elevation. The weather remained clear and the air cool with a hint of chill.
Flora and fauna
Langtang National Park is known for a rich and biodiverse flora and fauna. It records more than 1,000 species of vegetation with quite a number of endemic ones. To name a few, the forest is home to sal (Shorea robusta), chirpine ((Pinus roxburghii), Nepalese alder, silver fir, hemlock, and the most common rhododendron. An abundance of birch in Kyangjin, pines in Thulo Syabru and rhododendron mixed forest at Thadepati are noteworthy. The vegetation gradually shifts with the change in the altitude.
The park is equally rich in fauna such as musk deer, Himalayan tahr, Himalayan black bear, serow, the elusive snow leopard (still at a risk status), and, by far, the endangered, red panda. The park is also home to more than 250 species of birds including the Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus), the national bird of Nepal, and satyr tragopan (Tragopan satyra).
Rojisha on a plank crossing
Sherpa Gaun
After pedaling close to three hours on the hill section with a little pushing and occasional carrying on the rocky track, the group arrived at Sherpa Gaun (2,500 m). Surprisingly, Anamica and Rojisha both kept pace with their male partners. Dead beat, the group checked into a lodge for the night. Room tariff again was modestly priced, just Rs 300.00.
Less than a couple of decades ago, Sherpa Gaun was just a scattered hamlet on the hillside, so common about our far-flung regions, living on agriculture—growing potatoes, corn, wheat and barley and doing cattle farming—rearing cows, chickens, goats, sheep including mules and yaks.
Most of the residents of the village are said to have migrated from Tibet, some 600 years ago.  The border is close to the village. By and large, the residents of the village follow Buddhism. The name, Sherpa Gaun, sounds something like a misnomer, considering the predominance of the Tamang community.
Lugging it uphill
The pastoral scenario gradually changed as Sherpa Gaun became a regular stopover for the trekkers doing the Langtang Valley trek. The locals, besides their farming, supplemented their earnings by running lodges and teahouses.

The sheer remoteness of the place, the raw unsullied environs, the element of suspense, and adventure, the mystical identification with the entirety, and the absolute bliss of nature missed out on all the later trips. None compared with my first. It was the ultimate and unparalleled—period.
For me, the night at the three-tiered cavern in Kuri proved a fitful one. The ground floor had hollowed out enclaves, but the upper landing, where we were bedded down, was open with a huge flat rock, almost measuring the size of a house, precariously balanced in a 40-degree angle over us. It served as the roof.
My imagination seemed to run amuck. I feared that the huge rock overhead might, any time, crash down and turn us into a human sandwich. Although we had the logs blazing, it was bitterly cold.

Yeti
We got up early the next morning so that we could do the final ascent to Kalinchok located on a towering bluff. It was still dark at six in the morning. While we sipped scalding hot coffee, one of our group, the village bloke, left for the shrubs to relieve himself.
Barely had we finished half of our coffee than we heard a yelling that came from the direction the fellow had gone. Soon, we heard foot-falls and there he was in the half-light of dawn bounding towards us as if there seemed no tomorrow for him. We watched dumbstruck.
His face was an open book. He was panting and shaking, mumbling something incoherently. One of his hands still held his unfastened trousers. He kept on repeating “khyak, khyak, I saw a khyak.” Khyak stands for an apparition.
“Are you sure you saw it? What did it look like,” asked my uncle? He recovered his breath, paused a little, and then blurted it out, “it was eight to nine feet tall, hairy and with blood-shot eyes that bore into me.”
My pulse seemed to race like mad when the fellow gave the portrayal. The description he gave pieced together (as reported by the media then) like the Yeti, the Abominable Snowman—the ‘mysterious hominoid’. News about the Yeti often made the headlines worldwide those days. I started fantasizing about my name making it big in Time magazine with the cover story, “Yeti eventually photographed by a Nepali boy.” The feature-story would also carry my photograph. Oh Boy, that will make me a celebrity,” I mused excitedly.

Boyhood fantasy
We asked the fellow to lead us there. He balked first but yielded reluctantly, though. I grabbed my camera, and we all dashed to the spot. When we arrived at the place, the first light of dawn had broken in with the visibility fair.
I was carrying my dad’s Rolleiflex box camera, considered to be high-end in those days. The funny thing about the camera was that you had to peer down into a screen after flipping open the top cover and not look through the viewfinder at the subject like in modern-day ones. The Rolleiflex box camera is considered an antique today.
The fellow stealthily approached the spot where he supposedly saw the ‘khyak’. We crept behind. I’d my camera at the ready. But for the thick hedge and scrub, we saw nothing. We looked around but with no results. The castle I’d built in the air came crashing down. So much for my dream about the Yeti!
Looking back, it was nothing but my boyhood fantasy. Later, after we were back home in Dolakha, my uncle told me that the poor fellow fell sick and recovered only after he consulted a shaman and sacrificed a stout rooster at the Bhimeswor temple.

Highland
We left the cavern in the first light and began our climb. I was overawed to see the twin-crested butte that loomed above us in the north, which, my uncle announced, was our destination, the Kalinchok shrine. The narrow trail seemed perilous as it fell on its side into sheer drops. One false step could but prove fatal.
Image: Khasing Rai
I was surprised to find my breathing a tad laborious. “That’s because we have crossed the 10,000 feet mark, and this happens to be your first ever hike to so high an elevation,” my uncle explained. I hastened to gulp down a mouthful of sattu and pop in a pod of the raw garlic my grandma had stashed into my bag. After something like an hour, we arrived at a fork.
One path led straight across while the other went up on a narrow incline with stairs dug into the earth. “That’s the exit path,” my cousin informed me, pointing to our right. “We are now close to the shrine, just 200 yards to go,” he enthused.
Within minutes we were climbing the final rungs of a rusted iron ladder. Unlike the later years, the rickety iron ladder had no hand-rails and wobbled too. It doubled as a bridge between the twin buttes. We had to tread cautiously as the gaping chasm that fell into a dark depth stared back at us frighteningly. In all honesty, with no head for heights, I was petrified.
Image: Khasing Rai
The summit
Finally, we were at the crest of the narrow ridge. It took us close to two hours. It was kind of scary at that elevation as no handrails, introduced in the later years, secured the summit around. Neither did the paths, up the entire hike. The early morning thick fog at the top made the vibe eerier as the dark ravines on the sides looked threatening. It was cold, understood because we stood at 12, 605ft (3,842m).
Image: Khasing Rai
A solitary slate-roofed two-story house stood on the former crest. The dilapidated condition and the barred doors and windows spoke of its abandoned status. “That was a living quarter for the pilgrims, but as it was in a rundown state, it is not used anymore, “my uncle informed me.
To my dismay, there was no such thing as a temple housing the idol of a Bhagwati or Kali on the main ridge. The flat clearing, barely measuring 200 square feet, had a legion of tridents of all sizes haphazardly stuck into the ground next to a shallow hollow pit. The pit bore a natural spring enclosed by a small pagoda-style temple a little less than my height (5’-4”).

The devotees offered puja at this pit. A horde of bells, big and small, festooned a pillar next to the temple. The devotees offer tridents to the deity to pay their homage. Some also tender bells. Several unidentifiable stone deities lined the center of the ridge. “It is said the holy water from the spring drains down into a similar pit at the Bhimeswor shrine in Dolakha,” my uncle explained. I listened overawed.

My jaws dropped as I looked around. The clock seemed to stop—a “temporal illusion”? I was thrilled to see the majestic Gauri Shankar unfold right before my eyes in the east, as it were, gazing intently at me. A wisp of cloud caressed the snowy tips making me almost jump in a bout of euphoria, given that, it was my first ever hike to such great heights and the rarest rendezvous with the mighty snow-clad peaks.
Peaks galore
Craggy peaks ran the show in the north with the likes of Choba Bhamaré (5,933 m), Langtang Lirung (7,227 m), Dorjee Lakpa (6,966m), Shisha Panga (8,013m), Jugal (6,070m), Manasalu (8,156m), Ganesh I(Yangra,7,422m), Amabamori, Namburi, and many more. The lush hills in the south unfolded into an uninterrupted chain. I just could not believe my eyes, every which way I looked. I could barely contain myself at seeing such unparalleled grandeur and biodiversity.
My cousin informed me that the Kalinchok crest at night time also afforded a view of Kathmandu Valley illuminated at night. I spotted a foot-trailway down northwest, which meandered past a ridge and disappeared. “That,” my uncle explained, “led to Kuti, a village in ancient Tibet. It used to serve long ago as a busy route frequented by ancient traders.” He further informed me, “If the west escarpment of Kalinchok is the source of the Sun Kosi River, the eastern slope gives birth to Tama Koshi. The two rivers meet at Sindhuli.”
After puja (worship) over and an hour at the crest, we decided to leave. As we began our descent, I sighted a gang of shy red-billed choughs sunbathing on a ledge call out. Maybe that was to warn us not to hang around at the shrine longer, I thought. I visited Kalinchok, several times in my later years, on foot and by motor transport. My last trip, in 2014, was on my mountain bike.

 
In all those 50 years, the scenario has undergone no end of changes. The sheer remoteness of the place, the raw unsullied environs, the element of suspense and adventure, the mystical identification with the entirety, and the absolute bliss of nature, missed out on all the later trips. None compared with my first. It was the ultimate and unparalleled—period.
Lost and forgotten
I wonder if the ancient trail to Kalinchok still exists today. The presence of chortens (stupas), cairns, and the stone steles engraved with Tibetan inscriptions commemorating the departed souls in the middle of nowhere. The deathly still Simpani with the picture-perfect emerald green heart-shaped pond hemmed in by the tall pines.
The sightings of the danfé ((Lophophorus impejanus), or the Impeyan monal on high ridges, basking in the early morning sun; the Yaks attended by cows (chouris) roaming freely on the wild meadows and the woods. The sweet, invigorating Chhang (sweet corn wine) after the grueling climb at Thangsa, the sautéed dried yak meat with farm-fresh milk and soft chhurpi at Gairi, served by those smiling Sherpa ladies, who did not want to be paid–all seem but fond memories, nay a dream.
To say the least, how can I fail to recall the soul-searching experience I’d at the Dharmadwar (holy entrance)? The local myth ran that, by the will of God, only the devout could squeeze through the narrow slit between two huge rocks that made the Dharmadwar. It was said, the sinners always failed, no matter their size. I feel like guffawing today when I recall the incident. Even though I was a scrawny fellow then, my heart pounded when I underwent the trial (ordeal?).
Looking back, every wonderful moment I spent on the great wilderness trodding on the ancient trail to Kalinchok, as a youngster, seems a figment of my imagination—lost to the sands of time. Curiously, though, after 50 years yet, they still haunt my memories with a smack of nostalgia to this day.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-ancient-trail-to-kalinchok-memoir-i.html,"I journeyed to Kalinchok several times but none compared with the one I did the first time, which, today, has become little short of a memoir.
Consecrated to Goddess Bhagwati Kali, Kalinchok, the Hindu shrine nestles on a soaring bluff 12, 605ft (3,842m) above the sea level. Regarded a holy pilgrimage, the deity hugs a narrow ridge that sharply falls to deep ravines. Lush rolling hills punctuate the southern horizon in an unbroken chain as far as the eyes can travel.
If the north skyline parades an array of snow-capped peaks, the east on the other, towers with the sacred twin-peaked the Gaurishankar (7,134m) and the Melungtse Himal (7,181m).
The early days
Some half a century ago, Kalinchok seemed off-limits to the rest of Nepal. Just the locals of Dolakha, Charikot, and people from nearby villages visited the highland destination to pay their homage. The reason was not far to seek—lack of communication—roads. Dolakha and Charikot were not accessible by road and still fell short of electricity then.

Further, during those days, the foot-trail from Charikot to Kalinchok was no picnic. The narrow trail cut through rugged terrain and climbed steeply for hours on end. The paths were narrow, slippery, and without footholds at no end of places. The switchbacks that cut through the thick forest often vanished into overgrown shrubs. More often than not, people lost their way.
Only clusters of tiny villages lay in the first half of the journey, the rest of the route remained virtually deserted, harsh, cold and unrelenting—nay near frightening. The highlands bore only a handful of shacks belonging to the Sherpa community.
The weather, too, in those heights took a nasty shift at times, and even months like February and March caught hailstones the size of golf balls. At such times, the pilgrims had to face grave danger, as an adequate shelter was difficult to find. What’s more, local gossips ran high that wayfarers were often looted in the dense forest that intercepted the trail.
Arrival of roads
With the arrival of the Swiss-engineered Lamosanghu-Jiri Road (Pasang Lhamu Rajmarg) in 1985, connecting Charikot and later the dirt road from Charikot to Kuri in 2005, the destination gradually drew more visitors from far and wide including Kathmandu. Most comprised of pilgrims. Others included adventure lovers and odd foreign tourists.
Charikot, 133km northeast of Kathmandu can be reached today by bus. To access the burgeoning town of Charikot, the first leg of the journey takes a four-hour bus ride on the Arniko Highway to Khadi Chaur, Lamo Sanghu. The highway there meets a fork that, after crossing a steel bridge over the Bhote Koshi, follows a narrower feeder road on the right (road to Jiri or Pasang Lhamu Rajmarg), which goes to Charikot. From Khadi Chaur, it takes another two hours to Charikot.
From Charikot, it’s like 18km to Kuri. You can either hire or share with others a Bolero jeep. After Kuri, it’s a one and a half-hour walk up a steep hill with stone steps to climb. A year ago, a cable-car service opened to shuttle the pilgrims to Kalinchok from Kuri.
Shrouded in mystery
For ages, village folklore and myths abounded the Kalinchok shrine. A mere mention of the deity evoked emotions of awe, dread, and reverence among the native inhabitants of the hill-town Dolakha and nearby villages.

I still recall the words of my mother, a nonagenarian, aged 94 today, when I visited Kalinchok the first time. That was almost 48 years ago. “You better keep those things on your mind. First, do not attempt the shrine the wrong way. There are two approaches—one to gain admittance and the other to exit. The exit comes first but skip that and go a little further to follow the path that climbs to a steel footbridge.”
“Do not,” she continued, “hang around long after the puja. The shrine is visited by all kinds of spirits, some good others evil. Last but not least, do not at any cost return to the shrine after you exit the flight of steps down. You will meet with dire consequences if you do that,” she finished with an admonishing wave of her hand.
She went on to relate the incident when a local villager, disregarding the local belief, went back to collect something he’d left at the deity site. The fellow threw up blood and died after he was back home. That tale gave me the goosebumps.

The old days
I was a strapping youngster, just through with his SLC exams and a freshman at college, when I did my first hike to Kalinchok. I must have been 18 years old then (I’m 67 now). I was visiting my ancestral home in Dolakha for the first time with an uncle. The present Pasang Lhamu Highway was not built at the time. First, I travelled by bus on the Arniko Highway to a roadside town called Barhabishe, located at the banks of the Bhote Koshi River.
From Barhabise, the onwards journey to Dolakha began on foot, a gruelling hike that took a day and a half. The trail traversed across several villages but mostly forested areas crossed our path. We barely ran into wayfarers as the trail seemed deserted with no sign of habitation. We met people only when we neared small settlements.
There were no lodges and teahouses all along the route at the time. So, we had to spend the night in a village. For accommodation, we approached the nearest house and asked the owner. Amusingly, meals for the night depended largely on the owner’s hospitality.
After a day and one night on the trail, we finally arrived at Charikot at around 10 in the morning. “We’re almost home, it’s just four and a half kilometers from here,” announced my uncle. I could not wait to see my hometown.
Dolakha
Unlike Charikot, which happened to be just a cluster of thatched hamlets scattered around the hillside, Dolakha looked flourishing. The village, though small, boasted several shops and a school. As cobbled paths crisscrossed the town, stone spigots seemed to be located on every street. What struck me the most was the presence of Hindu temples and monuments in quite a number. I even saw a Buddhist stupa into the bargain.
I further learned that Dolakha served once as a flourishing Kingdom ruled by the Malla Kings. Little wonder, the modest little village seemed steeped in rich culture and history. The jewel in the crown, the Bhimeswor Shrine, the most revered deity of the Dolakhes, was regarded as the pride and glory of Dolakha. Its fame traveled far and wide and drew devotees by the thousands.
The local people of Dolakha claim that the stone deity at the Bhimeswor shrine perspires preceding any grave national catastrophe befalling the country. Despite repeated wiping, beads of sweat kept trickling down the stone effigy of Bhimeswor prior to the following: the devastating earthquake of 1934 (2007 B.S.), the demise of Panchayat government in 1990, the Royal carnage of June 1, 2001, at the Naryanhity Palace, to cite a few.

The ancient trail
After a few days stay at my ancestral home in Dolakha, we were all set to begin the trek, the trail trodden by my ancestors. My anxious grandma hastened to shove into my bag pods of raw garlic and sattu (finely-ground dry-roasted corn), urging me to munch on them when reaching the uplands. “That works against ‘lekh-lagné,” she said.
Lekh lagné translates to altitude sickness. Eating raw garlic and sattu when going to the highlands was a common practice in Dolakha. We hit the trail with my uncle, a cousin from Dolakha, and one village bloke. The first leg of the journey was to Charikot, four and a half kilometers west of Dolakha.
Farming and rearing goats and chickens seemed the distinguishing feature of the village. As we left the settlements behind, the trail led uphill through patches of terraced fields with rice, millet, and mustard. The rice fields were green with tender stalks, waist-high. Other patches had flowering mustard. The hillside seemed to stand out amidst the contrasting colours.

Groves of bamboo along the trails were a common sight. Over our shoulders to the south, we could see the receding Charikot drop steeply into unbroken terraces of lush rice fields cascading down to the Tama Koshi River that wound its way across a deep gorge.

After we passed by a cluster of thatched huts at a village called Chhotang, the landscape took a shift. The trail wound up with occasional settlements that crossed our path, but gradually dropped in number as it led across uninhabited terrain and lush woods.
As I laboured on the trail on the inclines, my city mind strayed to the thought that our far-off country locales could be so quiet and remote. The dense cover we intercepted held, temperate to sub-alpine mixed coniferous and deciduous forest, largely blue pine, hemlock, oak, and the ubiquitous rhododendron( Laligurans) and Chimal (white rhododendron).

The inimitable Sherpas
After a few hours on the remote uphill, we were relieved to see some sign of life. It was a small Sherpa hamlet called Gairi Gaon (2,450m). It consisted of just three shacks. If the north commanded a panoply of peaks in the distance, the mighty-looking Gauri Shankar stood right before our eyes in the east. There was a considerable chill in the weather.

The smiling Sherpas were very generous and offered us something to eat. The food included dried yak meat, boiled potatoes (their staple), and the local delicacy, chhurpi (hard cheese made from yak-cow or Chauri milk). Freshly made and soft, the cheese was very appetizing.
The Sherpa ladies were reluctant to accept the money my uncle offered for their hospitality but accepted coyly as we insisted. After Gairi, the higher we climbed, the outback seemed further isolated and wilder.
“After Gairi, the trail will be isolated all the way, no habitation, nothing to eat. So, expect nothing,” my uncle said with a smile. Very young as I was, and had never traveled out of the Valley, every moment, since I started for my ancestral home, was a one of its kind. When we stopped for brief respites, I munched on the dry-roasted soybean and maize my grandma had wrapped in a piece of rag and stowed into my bag. It surely worked when I felt the pangs of hunger.
The more we climbed, the harder the trail got as dense shrubs seemed to come in the way. Some even stung as they had sharp spikes. Many a time, I could not help feeling that we were lost. As we climbed further, the pristine backwoods teemed with tall pines in thick rows, which seemed to reach for the skies. No mortals around. Total serenity, complete solitude! Sheer bliss!
In one of my later hikes more than two decades later, the same stretch of the jungle was, to my horror, strewn with logs, many freshly felled, and the old left to decay. It looked the unscrupulous loggers had gone on a rampage. Some of the stumps measured close to three feet in girth. Later, I learned that they were more than 100 years old. All I could do was shake my head helplessly.
Kuri
As we slogged up a small clearing, it seemed the excruciating climb had finally ended. The spot was called the Ganesh Twapper. The trail descended into a small valley. “That,” announced my beaming cousin, “is Kuri, our stop-over for the night.” Darkness fell when we stopped at Kuri.
The meadows were bare of trees. In total darkness, we took shelter for the night in a cave called the teen-tallé-odar (literally a three-tiered cavern). As my uncle and others set about to prepare the evening meal, I lay down spent and starving.
We had to bear everything from home–rice, dal (pulse), vegetables, tea, and needless to say, the pots and pans for cooking. For cooking, we foraged for firewood. At night-time, we found dead logs to burn to fight off the cold. The village bloke had to go quite a distance to fetch them.
Even in early November, the temperature seemed to drop down to below zero at Kuri. For four months, the trail remained closed due to heavy snowfall. “The Sherpas from Gairi, Chothang, and Kuri relocate their dwellings and Yak goths (sheds) to lower climes before the onset of snow each winter,” my uncle explained. He had walked that trail to Kalinchok several times.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-gunfire-pond-why-you-should-visit-timbung-pokhari-in-eastern-nepal-2.html,"
Four days away from Kathmandu lies Timbung Pokhari, a religious pond at an elevation of 4335 m. The pond borders Taplejung’s Sindingwa Rural Municipality and Panchthar’s Yangwarak Rural Municipality.
The name ‘Timbung Pokhari’ originated from a Limbu word ‘Timbak’, which means the firing of a gun. The locals gave the pond this name as the pond often makes a sound that is similar to that of gunfire.

Majestic views of Kanchenjunga can be seen close to the pond which is 466 m in length and 154 m in width.
Even though the pond is covered in snow for six months every year, hosts of pilgrims have been visiting this pond to offer puja for a few centuries now. Pilgrims gather around the pond, especially during the month of Shrawan (July-August) and during festivals like Janai Purnima and Nag Panchami.

It is believed that by offering a puja in this pure pond, wishes of pilgrims come true along with their lives being filled with peace and happiness. But the locals also believe that bad things happen to the visitors if they have sin, greed and jealousy on their conscience.

The locals believe that the magpies around the area clean the pond on a regular basis. They also add that things that are in the pond or are being offered to the pond shouldn’t be taken away. Locals connect the death of 12 foreigners recently with the myth.

The journey from Kathmandu to Timbung Pokhari can take up to four days. If you wish to spend a day at the pond, it will take a total of nine days.
It takes two days on foot to reach Timbung from Chyangthapu, the starting point of Mid-Hill Highway. Due to the unavailability of the road, the only way to reach the pond is walking.

People from different places from Nepal and other countries visit Timbung Pokhari. As the pond is quite close to India’s border, it sees a lot of Indian pilgrims throughout the year from places like Manipur, West Bengal and Sikkim.

The pond is both unique in natural beauty and biodiversity. The area around the pond is home to various rare flora and fauna and is also known as the capital of herbs. Valuable herbs like bikham, kutki, padmachal, jatamasi, panchaule and yarsagumba can be found in the area along with aromatic herbs like sunpati, bhairungpani and sikpale.

The place is also home to animals like Himalayan monal, Himalayan blue sheep, Himalayan goral, bear, snow leopard, musk deer, red panda and many more.
The best time to visit Timbung Pokhari is between March and October. Mid-July to August is even better to get there and witness the unique culture of the area.

Having seen its potential, the local government is now working at promoting the place hosting various fairs in the area. The pond has also been featured on the list of 100 new tourism destinations that the federal government published a few days ago.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/fantastic-phoksundo-a-trip-to-nepals-deepest-lake-2.html,"
Ever since I watched the movie Himalaya (also known as Caravan), I always wanted to go to Dolpa and visit Phoksundo Lake. Having planned this trip more than once, 2018 became the year when I finally got a chance to visit Nepal’s pristine lake.
The way
Dolpa district is now accessible by road, but the easier way to get to the Phoksundo Lake is via air. That is why we took a flight from Nepalgunj to Juphal, from where we started our four-day trek towards the lake.
After the 35-minute flight, we started our trek to Dunai, descending through maize fields and local villages. We walked along the bank of Bheri River and reached Dunai after four hours.
The next day, we were headed to Chhepka. The six-hour trail descends through the streets of Dunai and crosses a bridge over Bheri River. After few kilometres, we reached Shey Phoksundo National Park check post.

From there, we ascended along the rock-strewn trail and trekked further through a series of hemp farms until we reached Kageni. Relishing the views of waterfalls and lush vegetation, we made our way through the tropical forests to reach our overnight stop: Chhepka.
The next overnight stop from Chhepka was the Jharana Hotel which was around six hours away. Ascending through a forested path filled with big cedar trees, we climbed up through wide meadows situated above the gorge of Phoksundo River, from where we get a great view of a high waterfall and a faraway view of Phoksundo Lake.
The five-hour journey from Jharana Hotel to the lake descended steeply through forests filled with birch trees to the upper reaches of the Phoksundo Khola, from where we trekked through the shores of the lake.

The lake
My dream of coming to the lake had come true. What I liked the most about the place was how the water changed colours. It was blue one time and light blue a little later.
Walking around the place, we also got to see a waterfall coming out of the lake. The Phoksundo Waterfall is believed to be Nepal’s biggest waterfall.
We also learned that the lake sees a lot of French tourists.

Facilities for trekkers
The tourists generally stay at Rigmo Village, which has a few tea houses. However, the lodges haven’t been managed well, which has put a dent in the beauty of the lake.
The walking trail to the lake isn’t as great with a lot of trees obstructing the way. Sometimes, it is quite narrow, which makes it quite difficult for tourists to walk. The mules use the same road which results in dirty trails and unhappy trekkers.
The people believe that enough has not been done to promote this area as a tourist destination. The lawmaker representing Dolpa, Satya Pahadi, shares that even though the place’s natural beauty is known to many, it hasn’t been getting enough tourists.
“This lake and the region’s natural beauty should be promoted by Nepal Tourism Board and its stakeholders. It needs to have sufficient infrastructure, which will make it easy for foreigners to come and enjoy the area,” she shares.

She also informs that the road is what most people complain about. “Tourists have nowhere to go after they visit the lake. There are so many areas which lack trail in the area” she explains.

Pahadi adds that a new committee should be formed for the conservation of both the area and the lake.
Dolpa is quite different, in geographical and cultural forms, from other districts in Nepal. It calls for a unique promotion strategy to develop the area to ensure that the tourists will have a value-for-money travel, demand stakeholders.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/four-destinations-to-start-out-mountain-biking-in-kathmandu.html,"
Hey guys, I expect my previous three-story series on mountain biking (mtb in short) has helped you get the hang of the basic bike skills and handling; and you must have pulled off quite some off-road short rides to the backcountry.
Maybe you would now like to try some challenging rides.  Let me help you with a lowdown on some locations for you to venture out, which can really turn out as fascinating daylong destinations.
For a start, the destination I am going to chart out for you is a one-day long ride with a moderate to rugged terrains, both paved and dirt including some isolated forested areas. So my advice to you is: Take along a partner with you–so much the better and more fun if you can muster a group of say three to four riders. That will also help you to learn group rapport and group dynamics.
Not to be missed
Hopefully, you will not miss out on the basic essentials for the trip such as a pump, spare tube, patch kit, a toolkit . . . and of course, a rain jacket.  Don’t!  Also, make sure that you are well-hydrated way before you kick off. What I always do before long rides is to drink a litre of oral electrolyte-blended water at least 5 hours before the start (mostly coinciding with a night before) and supplement it with water during the ride. If you are carrying a hydration bladder tucked into your backpack, all the better.
As you sweat a lot and lose a lot of fluid, you need to replenish yourselves to keep yourself hydrated and avoid getting the most dreaded issue like muscle cramps, which can really ruin your entire ride.  Caveat: do not start on a completely empty stomach. A light breakfast before the ride is a good idea.
“Electrolytes are analogous to the motor oil in your car—they don’t make the engine run, but they’re absolutely necessary to keep everything running smoothly. Proper functioning of the digestive, nervous, cardiac, and muscular systems depends on adequate electrolyte levels” writes Steve Born, a sports nutrition specialist.
It will be a good idea to stash in some energy bars or chocolates into your backpack to refuel yourself as you will be burning off a lot of calories doing quite some gruelling up-hills. Also, they can work wonders for your sapping energy and stamina. Bananas, too, can substitute for the energy bars if you forget to carry them.  Needless to write, carry water bottles. And if you wish to have a less sore bum, apply Vaseline under your crotch. And do not forget to put on your padded underwear.

1.
Nagarkot
Everybody knows about this scenic hill town, and most of you might have visited Nagarkot one time or other in a vehicle of some kind.  Of the many cycling destinations, Nagarkot (2,195 metres) comes first in my priority list for beginners as it combines both a tough climb and a thrilling adrenaline-pumping downhill experience. Apart from that, it offers several off-road back routes, some quite challenging.
Nagarkot
Nagarkot is like 32-33 km from Kathmandu with Bhaktapur en route. The road is paved all the way.   After crossing the Bhaktapur Bazaar, you have to hit the road to Kharipati. After that, the paved road starts climbing and continues all the way up to Nagarkot. Owing to the recent widening work underway, do not expect it to be a smooth paved ride. The uneven road, gravelly at places, can almost pass for an off-road–so much the better for an mtb rider!
Given the relentless uphill, as a first-timer, it might take you a little over four hours from Kathmandu to Nagarkot including brief respites for a breather and some refreshments; plenty of tea houses line the road. Start early, around seven or eight in the morning, if you want to have lunch at Nagarkot and get back home before dark. Lots of eateries there serve dal-bhat and being a touristy place, also other dishes like pasta, noodles, pizza, whatever you fancy.
From Nagarkot Bazaar, you can ride to the View Tower situated 3.5 km up on a slight hill. You can take a 360-degree panoramic image of the sprawling Himalayas including the Everest if the weather permits and you are armed with a telephoto zoom lens.
The return ride from Nagarkot the same way back will be a half hour to one hour faster since you will be free-wheeling down all the way from Nagarkot to Bhaktapur. Round trip back to Ktm: 64-65 km.
2.
Nagarkot-Changu-Bhaktapur
Changunarayan
For the return ride, there are several other options to choose from. First, you can take the Nagarkot- Telkot-Changu Narayan-Bhaktapur (10 km approx.) route which also offers an off-road motor track. After some 3.5 km backtracking from Nagarkot to Telkot junction, you come to a cross-section.
Take the road that goes to Changu. Better ask around, if you get confused about the correct direction. As you ride the Telkot gravelled road towards Changu (6.5km), you come to a fork, the track down goes to Bhaktapur while the one that goes straight heads towards the Changu Narayan shrine.
Said to be more than 3,000 years old and designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Changu Narayan shrine is well worth a visit.  There are two options going back to Bhaktapur:  either you take the paved road or backtrack to the fork you passed earlier and hit the Telkot-Duwakot-Jhaukhel off-road track.  The track crosses the forested Telkot hill down to Bhaktapur past small settlements on the way. Either way, the round trip to Kathmandu will be something like 66-67 km.
3.
Nagarkot-Kattike Bhanjhyang-Shali Nadi-Sankhu- Ktm    
Sali Nadi during Swasthani Brata
                                        
Beginners, you will be thrilled to your bones if you hit this trail–a most rewarding experience if you love downhilling. Rugged and challenging this trail will really put your skill to the test. Downhill all the way from Nagarkot, the jeep track is lined by a thick forest until you reach Kattike Bhanjhyang (9 km).
The ride from Kattike, a small settlement, to Shali Nadi, Sankhu (8km) is again all the way down with a section of stone-laden path with steep descents. You have to be extra careful on this bumpy downhill section. The trail crosses isolated forested hills and then gradually opens up to a beautiful countryside as you reach Shali Nadi, another famous Hindu shrine which hosts an annual festival in the month of Magh (January-February).
After Shali Nadi you enter the town of Sankhu also called Shankharapur, said to have been named so for its conch-shell shape. From Sankhu it’s 23 km to Kathmandu or two and a half hours ride. The round trip back home is like 72-73 km.
4.
Nagarkot-Kattike-Jarshing Pauwa-Sankhu-Ktm

This is a little longer route than the rest. From Nagarkot, you descend down to Kattike like you do for Shali Nadi.  You will meet a fork at Kattike. The road to your left goes to Shali Nadi. To head towards Jarshing Pauwa, you have to go straight (4 km) up.  After Kattike, the dirt road starts climbing cutting across small village settlements, forested area, and terraced fields that slope down in a steep drop. If you are lucky, you can see a sweeping view of the snow-capped mountains to your north.
The ride from Kattike to Jarshing Pauwa is like one and a half hours with mostly ascents, some really steep ones.  The elevation of Jarshing Pauwa is 1803 metres. The small village perched on an open hill boasts some good tea houses and a few resorts.
From Jarshinga Pauwa, you are met with a wide paved road that snakes all the way down through a beautiful forest to Lapsephedi and the Sankhu Bazaar (7.5 km).  Round trip to Ktm: 76-77km.
All things considered, the Nagarkot ride promises the beginners a truly thrill-packed getaway, whichever route they chose to ride back–the rides are tough, scenic, educative, challenging–all rolled into one! Caveat: For beginners, this ride can be really tough and gruelling and you might be nursing sore muscles the next day. But it is worth its weight in gold–a most rewarding experience indeed.
Take frequent breaks, soak in the beauty and the ambience of your surroundings, chat with the local people, capture the memorable moments into your camera . . . and do not forget to have that special sweet tea made from buffalo milk at a village tea shop–always my favourite when riding through the country!
Next, I will bring you more such ride info on short, day-long and some longer with night halts. Until then, ride safe and keep the rubber side down!

From the archive.",/travel,"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 04:25:41 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-buried-kingdom-of-simraungadh.html,"
In 2012, I visited Simraungadh, a quintessential Terai town, some 160 km south of Kathmandu. The trip was not planned but a last-minute decision—no more than one of my little quirks. But, much to my astonishment, it turned out the little-known town once prided as a thriving capital city of Mithila kingdom in the 11th century Karnata Dynasty.
After rounding off our pilgrimage to the Gadhimai, a Hindu shrine 20 km northeast of the border city Birgunj, I suggested my wife, Radhika, we pay a visit to Simraungadh, 13 km away. The whole idea of the sudden foray was to dig for clues to my ancestral roots, the early Dolakhes, the people of Dolakha, a hill-town 143 km northeast of Kathmandu.
To Radhika, my idea founded on hearsay (talked about by elders in Dolakha) sounded nothing short of a wild-goose chase. With the puja ritual wrapped up at Gadhimai (the Hindu shrine is also noted for holding the largest animal sacrifice in the world every five years), we drove off to Simraungadh.
Dismal start                                                                                                    
We were in for some bad vibes, however. We met a local who told us that only a week ago, a fellow was found murdered on the road to Simraungadh. Another fanned the flames by quipping in that the road cut across some isolated forest stretches was frequented by Indian dacoits.  That gave Radhika quite a fright. I thought the inside stories were a trifle exaggerated, if not just gossip. I managed to get her acquiescence reluctantly, though. There were three of us, Radhika, a priest from Gadhimai who kindly volunteered to guide us, and I. I was behind the wheel of our Hyundai Getz.
Our progress on the badly pitted road was slow, almost a crawl at some places. Some sections of the dirt road required weaseling out of a lot of potholes. All this time, as we sped past deserted locales and wooded stretches, an edgy Radhika kept on casting suspicious looks outside the window.
As we drove along, vast swathes of harvest-ready rice fields flanked the road with thin habitation and insignificant motor traffic—all the more reason for Radhika to get worked-up. All we intercepted, less than halfway, was a solitary bullock-cart lurching along the uneven road with gunny sacks piled high.
The archetypal Terai
Radhika sighed in relief as a few motorbikes and trucks passed by kicking up clouds of dust. Soon, we cruised past small shanty settlements with thatched-roofed mud house, some tiled—the kind so typical about the Terai. We saw men and women going about their ways, some walked, others rode bicycles. The most common sight included women ambling along the side of the road with some kind of a load balanced on their covered heads. Curiously, most of the women, old and young alike, wore white dhotis sans blouses.
As we drove on, I noticed roadside clapboard shops on stilts selling all and sundry but with hardly any customer. Mango groves, Jamun (Indian blueberry), and coconut trees dotted the distant fields. The entire landscape gave a sleepy and deserted look.
Everyone gave a curious look at our passing car, even domestic cattle. While people stopped to look, stray cows, buffaloes, and goats turned their heads at us wide-eyed. Some even spooked.   Excited children ran along the side of the car. Pariah dogs gave a chase barking furiously.
The smell that wafted through our car windows was distinct– burning leaves and the dung-cakes. A strong pungent smell of molasses, at times, stung our nostrils. There was no mistaking the Terai!  Those outer reaches seemed to be under a spell in a timeless past, inching away at its own pace, untouched or undisturbed by the urban boom.
Unusual traffic
After an hour’s dusty ride, we finally arrived in Simraungadh. Nothing looked new, no different from another of those dreary impoverished village towns you see in the terai. The town area boasted a little modernity with crummy tea-houses and shops lining the streets. Modern brick houses and mud hamlets, however, seemed grossly at odds as they huddled together back-to-back.

Squalor and poverty lay behind the town’s incongruous modern façade. The main bazaar bustled with life. Bicycles, rickshaws, motorbikes, tractors, bullock carts, stray animals and occasional tangas (horse-carts) made up the traffic. People milled around amid blaring music belting out Hindi film tunes. Dust and filth appeared all around. Chaos!
After parking our car, we looked around for some help. We wanted to find people who might know about the Dolakhes. I intercepted an elderly dhoti-clad gentleman and asked him. After a quizzical long look at us, he suggested in his broken Nepali we try the main bazaar chowk (square).

Disappointment
In that part of the Terai, the predominant language was Maithili and Bhojpuri. People seemed uncomfortable at speaking Nepali. At the main bazaar, we approached a young fellow in jeans. He looked like a student but all we got from him was a shake of his head. A skeptical Radhika suggested trying some shops. We did but to no avail. After an hour of running around, the dust, the din, and the noonday sun took their toll on us. We were sweating hard and exhausted.
Then, a glimmer of hope… A middle-aged fellow we met at the bazaar asked us to try a certain street. Off we went looking. Some 15 minutes later, we found it. Much to our consternation, we met a family there from Gorkha, and not Dolakha. Blast it! Our informant must have got confused by the similar-sounding words.

With fallen faces, we tried everything; we met on our way back. Our efforts seemed futile. It was time to quit, I thought. So much for my ancestor-hunting! We decided to take a look around the village-town, though.
Tour of the town
Lunch at a roadside eatery proved far-out. To our amazement, the food was served on newsprint paper—a tingling spicy mutton curry with bhuja (dry-roasted rice grain) with slices of onion and radish. The garnishing included a wedge of lemon and a green chilly. For me, the lunch proved an ordeal since I was not used to fiery hot food.
Kankali Mai
After lunch, we first visited the Kankali Ishra Mata Shrine. Going by history, it was after 1800 BCE that the Indo-Aryans first started building Hindu temples of worship. The locations they chose were picturesque places. Small wonder: Hindu shrines are found mostly on river banks, hilltops, seashores, by the side of reservoirs, and the like. The Kankali shrine boasted an impressive reservoir on its side, which was said to have been built by King Shiva Singh in the 12th century for his daughter Ishwari Singh. Locals called it the Ishra Pond.
A gaunt bearded fellow, the main priest of the temple, Ram Chandra Das, showed us around the temple site. “Mysteriously, time and again, Goddess Kankali Mai switches her abode to far removed places such as Patna, as Patandevi, to Kolkata as Kali, or Betia, all cities in India’s Bengal and Bihar state,” he said, also shedding light on the myths and legends associated with the deity.
Reservoir at Kankali shrine
The main temple, a nagara (curvilinear) architecture, housed a three-foot-tall black polished idol of Goddess Kankali Mai—an avatar of Kali, the Hindu goddess of enlightenment and liberation. Curiously, it bore an uncanny resemblance to the idol of Gadhidai we saw earlier at Bariyarpur.
Previously known as Kangankali for the Goddess’s fetish for kangans (bangles), the idol heavily draped in a red shawl and adorned with shiny golden motif, carried the same height and build of Gadhimai.
The idol stood under the extended hood of the mythological Shesh Nag, the thousand-headed cobra. According to Hindu mythology, the Shesh Nag symbolises ‘eternity’ and holds the entire universe on its head. The most striking likeness between the idol at Gadhimai and the Kankali Mai was the large protruding eyes cast in silver.
Only the saffron cloth that draped the Shesh Nag seemed to distinguish them apart. Our guide told us that Gadhimai was an incarnation or avatar of none other than the Kankali Mai.

Next to the shrine stood a 700-year-old domed building with a steeple. Its inner sanctum housed the samadhi (tomb) of Mansha Baba, a revered baba, or saint, who was said to have miraculously entered the earth by his divine powers to breathe his last peacefully.

History
Recalling Nepal’s medieval history, Simraungadh was the capital city of Mithila kingdom (also called Tirhut) in 1097 AD. The Mithila region was bounded by the Mahananda River on the east, the Gandaki on the west, the Ganges on the south and the Himalayas on the north, spreading over half of present-day Bihar State, India. Mithila finds its mention in the sacred Hindu epic Ramayana by Valmiki, too.
The Karnataor Samaroon dynasty was founded by the King of Bengal, Nanyadev in the 11th century. He first ruled Mithila. His successors reigned over Mithila for more than two centuries. The regime ended with the 5th successor, Harisimha Deva (1295-1324 CE) following an invasion of Mithila by the Mughal warrior Ghias-Ud-din Mohammad Bin Tughlak in 1324-25.
Simraungadh was razed to the ground following the siege. King Harsimha Dev and his family fled north into the hills and remained in hiding. Then, with his entourage, he left for Dolakha but died on the way at a place called Tinpata in Sindhuli. There are no two opinions about Harisimha Dev’s flight. Both Nepal and Mithila vaṃśāvalis (genealogies) support it.
However, speculations run high over Harisimha Dev’s post-flight period, and it is the issue much debated amid historians. Some claim King Harisimha Deva, under a refugee status, entered the Nepal Valley (also called Nepal Mandala—Bhadgaon, Kantipur and Lalitpur) around the beginning of the 14th century. Others maintain that he even ruled the Nepal Valley.
The inscription erected at Hanumandhoka by King Pratap Malla (1641-1674 AD) illustrates how Harisimha Dev came to Ashmanagar (Panauti), and then to Nepal Valley. A similar account by Pratap Malla is also to be found at the Pashupatinath inscription. History pages also mention that the Tulaja Bhawani deity was brought to Nepal Valley by Harisimha Dev from Simraungadh. The Malla Kings came to adopt and revere it as their tutelary deity.

Ranibas
Our last visit included the Ranibas, the residence (bas) of the queen (rani).The palace was built by the Karnata King Shiva Singh in the 12th century for his daughter Queen Isri Devi. The site later came to be converted into a Ram-Janaki Hindu shrine.
Ram Mandir
History records that in the 1850s (AD), Prime Minister Jung Bahadur’s son General Jit Jung Rana built the temple in memory of his father. Flanked by thick brush, the narrow path that led to the temple opened on to a wide forecourt with a huge gnarled kabhro tree (a kind of fig tree that bears wild fruit used for making pickle). A mango orchard lay next to it.
A flight of steps led to the entrance of a square, two-storied tin-roofed brick structure—said to be the living quarters that surrounded the temple premises. Closely similar to the Kankali temple but much larger and imposing, the two-storied structure was painted in vibrant colors and stood high on a raised platform.
Falling wall of Ram Mandir quarters
The interior of the temple housed idols of Ram, Sita, and Laxman, three of the mythical gods from the Hindu Ramayana epic. They all sat in a row, while statues of Jung Bahadur Rana, his wife, and son Gen. Jagat Jung, knelt before them with folded hands.
Statues of Ram, Laxman and Sita
Two large metallic bells, said to have been added to the shrine by Jagat Jung, bore inscriptions dated BS 1933 (1876 AD). In the foreground of the temple, a big statue of Hanuman, the Hindu monkey God from Ramayana, sat on a raised pedestal. “The shrine attracts a capacity crowd of worshippers every year on the day of Ram Navami (birthday of Lord Ram),” informed a local guy.
The courtyard held an ancient well. Stone relics lay in some disarray at a corner of the courtyard. The living quarters for pilgrims girdling the temple appeared in a pitiably run-down state with the walls falling apart. It was clear the premises were sorely neglected.

A pond, said to belong to the olden days, was located on the western periphery of the temple. “The Ranibas used to boast 208 wells and as many lotus ponds, but most are buried, some dried up, and only a handful remains now,” said Anirudra Mishra, a priest at the shrine.

Buried Kingdom
We tried in Simraungadh to locate some ruins that bore the barest testimony to its glorious past. Save for some relics at Ranibas, the locals, however, failed to point even to stray old lumps of bricks that once belonged to the last king’s palace or that fortified the high walls of the old city.
Relics at Ram Mandir
It looked nothing remained, which evoked some faint images of the erstwhile Kingdom.  A local fellow, however, told us that if dug up no deeper than a few feet any place around the 28 sq-km area of the old city, it would fetch medieval-era artifacts and earthen pots. Nay even gold and silver!
Legends, myths, and history spoke loud and clear about Simraungadh’s vibrant past. But on completion of our tour, it was hard to believe that the dusty and dreary little town revelled once as the capital city of a booming medieval kingdom ruled by a sagacious Karnata King. As it stands, the kingdom lies buried into the bowels of the earth.

https://english.onlinekhabar.com/ride-through-sindhuligadhi-three-child-cyclists-steal-the-show.html,"Shubham (left), Suyog (Right) and Aditya (2nd from Right) preparing to ride to Janakpur
As over 170 cyclists rode to Janakpur from Kathmandu during the 4th edition of the annual Ride Through Sindhuligadhi event last weekend, three kids caught everyone’s eye.
Shubham Shrestha, Suyog Man Basnyat and Aditya Shrestha are just eight, 10 and 13 respectively; but they were all prepared to cycle the 250-kilometre journey to Janakpur via Sindhuligadi.  All three of them seemed to push each other one peddle at a time along with dozens of adults on the way. While Aditya and Shubham skipped a part of the climb to Sindhugadhi from Mulkot, Suyog along with his father Yogendra Man Singh Basnyat completed the entire route on his bicycle.
Many were surprised seeing their stamina. “What these kids are doing is remarkable. Riding with adults along the dangerous tarmac road is quite inspiring. Not only have they pushed each other, but they have also inspired other riders who had self-doubt,” shares Sudip Poudel, the ride leader of the event.
The boys were not only inspirations but were also the stars of the show. From local villagers to fellow riders, everyone wanted a selfie with the trio whenever they stopped for water breaks. They were celebrities for three days.
Suyog and Shubham giving an interview.
All three boys picked up cycling from a young age. The fathers of all three, who are also cyclists, over the course of a few years groomed these kids’ passion for cycling.
“Suyog started when he was three, but he began participating in these rallies when he was six. He’s always showed a desire towards cycling. As I ride, he wanted to do the same and I don’t see any harm in him doing this. He enjoys cycling and its challenges and I like to see him overcome these challenges,” shares Yogendra, his father.
The same was the case with Aditya, whose father Deepak Shrestha facilitated his son’s passion for cycling.
“I like him riding his bike and being a part of these events. I feel it gives many people the urge to do the same. He is passionate about it and also enjoys doing this. I hope his love and enthusiasm for cycling never dies,” says Deepak, adding he brought his son Aditya after watching Suyog cycling nearly the entire length of the ride last year.
“I enjoy riding. It makes me feel good. I don’t do enough of these long tours but when I get the chance, I enjoy it quite a bit. Sometimes my father does not let me ride the entire length of these tours, but it’s still fun cycling up to whatever point I can,” adds Aditya.
Shubham rides with fellow riders
Shubham too has the same enthusiasm on his face. He rides a bicycle which is clearly for the kids older than him but still, he rides with ease. While peddling, he has to stand up and after he gathers some momentum, he sits down. From a small town of Udayapur, he had come to Kathmandu with his father and his uncle to ride to Janakpur. But due to some problems, his father had to return leaving the eight-year-old with his uncle
His father Chiran shares that Shubham, like Aditya and Suyog, started riding from six.
“We take him on rides regularly in Udayapur. He enjoys it. He loves his bicycle. His technique is quite different but he seems to be comfortable with it. We take him out every Saturday and whenever events like this happen. He’s been the start of the show this year. I hope he can make it here again the next year.”
When asked if he was afraid while riding on the road from Kathmandu to Janakpur, young Shubham says he rather enjoyed it. He shares that he liked the attention he received from others. But he did get a bit angry when asked to take the bus from Khurkot to Sindhuligadhi. Sitting on the bus, he kept on posing the same question, “Why did they put me here? I want to be out there.”
“We took the decision because he’s too young and the uphill is too long. Maybe in a few years’ time, he can do the complete ride,” explains Poudel.
Aditya checking if the breaks of his bikes are working properly
But them being on the trip is enough to motivate cyclists. Rabit Maharjan, an adult participant of the event, shares that watching Suyog climb up the uphill to Sindhuligadhi gave him the motivation to ride on. The same was the case for McDara O’Shea from Ireland. O’Shea, who is embarking on a cycling journey from London to Singapore, shares that all three kids gave him added motivation.
“They are brilliant. You see people watching these kids and admiring their guts and determination. I feel quite privileged to have ridden with these young boys. I hope they carry on cycling,” he adds.
When asked if they will do the ride again, the boys say that they would love to, however, their parents say that only time will tell what happens next.
The orgasiners also feel that the participation of these young boys is important in the longer run. “Last year, we only had Suyog. This year, we had Aditya and Shubham. People have promised us that they too will bring their kids along this ride, which means that these kids are doing something really great,” explains Poudel.",/travel,"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 05:01:58 +0000"
https://english.onlinekhabar.com/living-with-mahakali-the-river-of-contradictions-photo-story.html,"The Mahakali is a river of contradictions. The river, which originates near the Tibetan plateau, is rich in resources, yet people living on its banks are poor and marginalised; the river nourishes life on its banks, but it also wreaks havoc from time to time.
The Mahakali bridge joins Chandani and Dodhara villages west of the river to the rest of Nepal.
The Mahakali bridge, which connects Chandani and Dodhara villages to the rest of Nepal is also full of contradictions. While sand and pebbles mined on the banks of the river are used to build concrete bridges elsewhere, the bridge here is made of metal.

 
 

 
Sand and pebble miners returning to Nepali land.
The Mahakali gushes through the slopes of western Nepal carrying debris and sand with it. The sand is mined and transported to the market. The contradiction here is that while the sand provides much-needed life-saving money for the local community, unscientific mining has increased the risk of life-threatening floods. In addition to that, destructive fishing practices such as poisoning and electrocution of fish in the river are also taking a toll on local livelihood.
 
Women groups in the lower reaches of the Mahakali are taking the lead in local conservations.

With most of the men in the area leaving their homes in search of work in India and beyond, it is now up to the local women to take up the challenge to deal with the contradictions of the Mahakali. With support from Oxfam’s Transboundary Rivers of South Asia (TROSA), they have formed women’s groups to lobby for policy changes to conserve the river and its resources.
Women’s groups meet regularly to discuss various local issues.
While the groups are just starting out, their work looks promising. Some of the groups have set up fish conservation areas where destructive fishing has been banned. The groups hold regular discussions with local representatives of their municipalities to discuss ways to conserve the river.

Children take a dip in the Mahakali on a hot day.
The Mahakali river has changed a lot; some of the changes may be irreversible. But there is a hope that the local communities will take the lead to save it.",/travel,"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 06:26:32 +0000"
