Moscow, 26 November (2019) – 
H.E. Anatoliy Vasilievich, Rector, Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO)
Distinguished faculty members
Dear students,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
First of all, I extend to you all warm greetings on behalf of the Government and people of Nepal and on my own.
My sincere thanks go to the Institute of International Relations for organizing today’s programme. The Institute’s continued partnership with the Embassy of Nepal at different forums reflects nothing but true affinity, close academic interaction and growing people-to-people exchange.
It is my distinct honour to meet with the faculty, students and researchers of this Institute of high repute here in Moscow on the occasion of my official visit to the Russian Federation.
I have heard a lot about the extraordinary contributions of MGIMO in the articulation of Russian foreign policy. As alma mater of top Russian diplomats, intellectuals and politicians, I commend your stellar performance, particularly in enhancing the scope of research and knowledge base in the field of contemporary global politics.
I am very pleased to be present amongst you to exchange our views and experiences on how we can best contribute from our respective sides to further strengthening the already warm bilateral relationship between Nepal and Russia.
We greatly value the continued dialogue and exchange by engaging all walks of life and different sectors of development. I offer my sincere appreciation to you all for playing an active role in strengthening multi-faceted ties that exist between Nepal and the Russian Federation.
Nepal and the Russian Federation are old and good friends. Ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1956, we have maintained cordial and friendly relations. This year marks the 63rd anniversary of the establishment of formal ties. I would like to extend warm felicitations to all of you on this happy occasion.
 
Esteemed Friends, 
 
In my presentation today I will briefly touch on three key aspects: Nepal-Russia relations; Nepal’s foreign policy orientation in the changed context; and Nepal’s development journey ahead and our priorities.
 
Let me first  pick up Nepal-Russia relations.
 
Nepal greatly values the bond of friendship it enjoys with the Russian Federation. Our relations have progressively evolved over the years to cover political, economic, social, cultural and educational dimensions. It is a multidimensional partnership.
Continued engagements at various levels and mutual cooperation in the areas of common interest have nurtured our friendship.
Parliamentary and judicial exchanges and frequent visits by high officials of both countries have contributed to widening the scope and enriching the substance of our relationship.
The objective of my visit this time, in my capacity as Foreign Minister of Nepal, has been to bolster trust, deepen political understanding, promote economic, commercial and cultural ties and strengthen collaboration in dealing with regional and global issues of common concern.
In this light, Foreign Minister Lavrov and I exchanged substantive views on a wide range of topics during our official talks yesterday. We agreed to work together to take our relations to the next level through enhanced political engagement and promotion of mutually beneficial cooperation in diverse fields. We underlined the importance of exchanging high level visits between the two countries, activating established bilateral consultation mechanism and concluding a host of agreements and understanding to further cooperative partnership.
I am satisfied with the outcome of our discussions and our consensus on the road ahead to realize the full potential of our mutual cooperation.
As you are aware, my visit has taken place in the fundamentally changed national context of Nepal. Nepal’s long political transition following a decade-long armed conflict has ended. A new democratic and inclusive Constitution promulgated in September 2015 has settled long-standing political issues. The elections held in 2017 under the provisions of the Constitution have produced a stable government with over two-thirds majority in the Parliament first time in two decades, thereby ending the cycle of political instability. Policy clarity and consistency in development efforts has been realized and the ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ has been defined as country’s overarching national aspiration. A clear sense of direction and commitment in the conduct of an independent and balanced foreign policy based on the notion of ‘amity with all, enmity with none’ has underpinned our worldview.
This visit is also about Nepal’s commitment to reenergizing all aspects of multi-faceted Nepal-Russia friendship. Needless to say, the full spectrum of our friendship is much more than the formal contacts. There has been an increasing level of cultural cooperation and interactions engaging the private sector and other people-to-people exchanges. Students, entrepreneurs, diaspora, scientists, artists, mountaineers, tourists and importantly the academia from both the countries have made significant contributions.
People-to-people relations give added value to Nepal-Russia relations, which began with the visit of the renowned Russian Scholar Ivan Pavloviech Minayev to Kathmandu in 1875. It has been reinforced by Russian literary icons like Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky and Pushkin who have great influence in Nepali literature. It is heartening that many Russians have attraction towards the Hindu, Buddhist and the Eastern philosophy.
Some Nepali and Russian nationals are residing in each other’s countries for a variety of reasons. I thank the Russian community for hosting Nepali nationals and supporting them.  I also express my sincere thanks to the friendly Russian people for their help in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in 2015. As Foreign Minister Lavrov told yesterday, the true friendship came into full play when Russia promptly and spontaneously sent a team of medical doctors along with humanitarian supplies for rescue and relief.
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
It is encouraging to witness continued progress achieved by the Russian Federation over the decades. In the fields of technologies, infrastructure, innovation and research, the progress has been remarkable. The Government, people and the academic circle of Nepal greatly appreciate these and many other stellar achievements made by the Russian Federation.
The steady course taken by Russia in achieving sustainable economic development, industrialization and high-end technological advancement have been glaring example of its perseverance and dedication. Over the decades, the Russian partnership with the global south has been increased.
Nepal sincerely appreciates support and cooperation extended by the Russian Federation in industrial and infrastructure development in the past. The technical cooperation has helped significantly lay the groundwork for Nepal’s economic development.
Nepal has learnt from Russia the development planning model.  Nepal adopted systematic and planned development efforts since 1956 and we have in place the 15th edition of the Development Plan. The best practices of the Soviet Planning model have helped Nepal shape its planning framework.
On a different note, Russian scholarships on higher education for Nepali students and public-sector professionals have been highly useful. There are a number of Nepali nationals trained in the Russian Federation occupying higher positions in politics, administration and the private sector today.
Nepal and the Russian Federation have been working closely in multilateral forums as well. One important avenue I would like to mention is the United Nations, which Nepal considers to be the cornerstone, custodian and emblem of multilateralism. With emphasis on a just and balanced world order for peace and stability, Nepal believes in multilateralism and rules-based international order.
At a time when the world is facing multiple challenges, the Russian initiatives in global fight against terrorism, cybercrime, climate change and other pressing global issues have been commendable. Let me underline that primacy of international law and value of world peace in the conduct of foreign policy help reduce tension and conflict.
Nepal has been contributing to the maintenance of the international peace and security by consistently and substantially supporting UN peacekeeping operations. Our troops are presently working in 15 out of 16 peacekeeping missions around the world and mostly in the troubled parts of the world. Russia, being a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has an important role to fulfill, together with other members, that peacekeeping missions accomplish their objectives in a timely manner within the given mandate. We call for enhanced consultation and coordination with TCCs/PCCs when taking important decision on peace missions.
Regional cooperation is one of the defining attributes of international relations today. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), founded jointly by the Russian Federation and other friendly countries in the region, is a new opportunity for institutionalizing a long-lasting environment for peace and prosperity in the region, and beyond. As a Dialogue Partner, Nepal has found SCO as an additional platform for engaging in mutually beneficial projects in a wide areas including trade, transit, investment, energy, agriculture, small and medium enterprises and culture. We are looking for a full-fledged membership of the organization to enhance our contribution. We are thankful to the Government of the Russian Federation that it was in Ufa, Russia, the decision to grant Nepal the dialogue partner status was taken.
Nepal has been collaborating, directly or indirectly, on matters of common interest with the Russian Federation in all available platforms. We will continue this in future.
Let me inform you, in this context, the Government of Nepal has established a permanent dialogue forum, Sagarmatha Sambaad (Mt Everest Dialogue) to deliberate on contemporary issues of national, regional and global significance. The first episode of this international dialogue platform will be devoted to the theme ‘climate change mountains and future of humanity’ and will be held on 2-4 April next year in Kathmandu. This will provide yet another opportunity for Nepal and Russia to strengthen partnership in the collective interest of humanity.
Distinguished guests,
Next aspect is Nepal’s foreign policy orientation.
Never colonized and subjugated, Nepal has always remained an independent nation. This speaks of our glorious history and evolution as a nation.
Our foreign policy orientation is very much influenced by this legacy. As I stated earlier, we pursue an independent, non-aligned, balanced foreign policy based on the philosophy of friendship and cooperation with all countries in the world. We do not believe in enmity. We do not nurture ill feelings towards anyone.
The UN Charter, the Panchasheel—the five principle of Peaceful Coexistence, non-alignment, respect for international law, value for world peace guide our foreign policy. We believe that respect for every country’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries are the essential ingredients of healthy inter-state relationship.
As with any other country, Nepal also gives priority to its relationship with its neighborhood and extended neighbourhood. We have defined that our relationship with neighbours and other countries is based on the principle of sovereign equality, mutual respect and benefit. Guided by this principle, the present Government has made substantial efforts to enhance and consolidate friendly ties and cooperative partnership with neighbours and other friendly countries. It is our principled commitment which we are translating into action that we will not let our territory to be used against the interest of our neighbours and any other friendly nation. This has helped us earn confidence and trust of neighbours.
Our immediate neighbours happen to be the world’s two most populous countries and the fastest growing economies. It gives Nepal ample prospects for its economic development. We have the potential to be a vibrant bridge connecting the two sides for common benefits.
As a region full of potentials, diversity and challenges, South Asia should continue to engage in promoting the collective interest with utmost sense of regional solidarity, mutual respect and accommodation divergent views. We want peace and stability in our region and beyond. We believe that all differences can be resolved amicably through peaceful means.
Major powers, such as the Russian Federation, development partners and other friendly countries are in the priority of our foreign policy orientation. We have significantly enhanced our partnership with this group of countries. We are committed to further widen and deepen our relationship for mutual benefit. These countries are an important source of our development financing and trade relationship. Beyond neighbourhood, they are also a source of inbound tourists and technology.
The labour receiving countries are also in our priorities, as a large number of Nepali migrant workers are living there for employment. We are trying to diversify our relations with them to cover such vital areas as trade, investment, tourism and transfer of technology.
Regional cooperation features prominently in our foreign policy priority. We want to promote meaningful regional cooperation for the collective well-being of the people in the region. We attach importance to SAARC and BIMSTEC as principal vehicles for regional cooperation in our region. As I said earlier, we want to enhance our engagement in SCO. We are also pursuing the objective of sub-regional cooperation within the framework of BBIN-Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. We are also a member of the Asian Cooperation Dialogue.
Our commitment to UN Charter is unflinching. We are a strong supporter of multilateralism. As discussed earlier, the UN is an indispensable global institution for us as it is the only legitimate organization which is capable of dealing with a host of contemporary issues we face today. Ours is an international perspective that believes in collective prosperity of mankind and rejects unilateralism. We stand for general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. We support nuclear free zones and peace zones. We unequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
We call for a just, harmonious, inclusive and peaceful world order where all nations enjoy their rights while fulfilling their obligations in good faith.
Economic diplomacy has been a key component of our overall diplomacy.  We are building economic partnership with friendly countries focusing on trade, investment, tourism, technology transfer, climate financing and decent jobs for migrant workers. Our diplomatic missions have been tasked to promote economic diplomacy to support our national drive for rapid yet sustainable development.
Distinguished friends,
Let me touch on the last component of my presentation. That is about our development priorities.
Economic transformation is our most important national task ahead. We are still an LDC.  We have additional difficulties as well. We are a country emerged from conflict and we are also a landlocked countries. This sums up the nature of our development challenges, which are of course manifold and complex.
Development is a national responsibility and we are fully aware of it. But our domestic resources are not sufficient to overcome our huge development challenges. And, we do not have luxury to wait for long, as we are lagging behind. We have to quicken the pace.
Our immediate goal is to graduate from LDC and become middle-income country by 2030 which is also the deadline for the realization of SDGs. We have envisioned a long-term plan to achieve national prosperity by 2041. We will redouble our efforts to realize the national aspiration of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ within this timeframe.
Towards realizing the national aspiration, we will expediate the process of economic development. While internal resources are important, we count on international support and goodwill to enhance trade performance and seek enhanced level of foreign direct investment. With a view to attracting foreign direct investment, we hosted an Investment Summit in Kathmandu in March this year. The Summit attracted a large number of prospective investors, including from Russia.
To make the business environment more attractive, friendly and competitive, investment related laws and institutions have undergone constant reform. For example, Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act (FITTA), Public Private Partnership and Investment Act, Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Act have been promulgated and One-Stop Service has already been operationalized. Some other legislative reforms are in the pipeline such as Intellectual Property Rights Act.
Nepal’s friendly investment climate is evident from the World Bank’s Doing Business Report. Its latest report ranks Nepal among South Asia’s most favourable countries for ease of doing business.
Nepal has huge hydropower potentials. Exploitation of this precious resource can change the economic face of our country and the region. Investment in this sector is highly profitable as there is no problem of market. Regulatory framework exists to facilitate export of power generated in Nepal to India and Bangladesh.
Agriculture, tourism, mines and minerals, infrastructure development and IT are some of the areas where investment can be highly profitable. We have a liberal investment regime that allows investment in almost all sectors. Negative list is very short. We also offer a range of incentives that are unique and special to our context.
At this juncture, Nepal has high hope of solidarity and support from our trusted friends. Your own involvement or encouragement to the business community to explore investment opportunities in Nepal would go a long way. Nepal is fully committed to protect your investments. Political stability gives policy stability, which is the fundamental element to ensure predictability in foreign investment regime.
At present the level of trade and economic engagement between Nepal and the Russian Federation stands at a modest level. Rather than staying discouraged with the figures, I think it should be taken as an opportunity to attain a higher and swifter level of trade, commercial and investment engagements between us.
It is upon us–the Governments, the private sector, academia and people of all walks of life–to strive for meaningful and substantive cooperation in all sectors, including trade, investments and tourism. There is a need to energize the role of Nepal-Russia Chamber of Commerce and Industries towards building business networks and kickstart doable projects in hand.
As you may be aware, Nepal is celebrating 2020 as Visit Nepal Year. An increased number of Russian friends to visit Nepal for tourism would greatly help the campaign. Nepal is a must-visit destination in one’s lifetime. Famous Poet Rasul Gamzatov was right when he described Nepal as ‘diamond yet to be crafted’. Investment in Nepal’s tourism infrastructure, which remains one of the lucrative areas, will also greatly help boost Nepal’s economy.
The Embassy of Nepal will work closely with you all, including the Non-Resident Nepali Association, Chambers, Friendship Associations and other partners, to make the Visit Nepal Year a success. As your good friend and also as the Foreign Minister, I would like to extend to you all a very warm invitation to visit Nepal at your convenience.
As I conclude, I once again appreciate you all for organizing this function and also for your kind presence. Ambassador Rishi Ram Ghimire and his team deserve my special appreciation for the hard work.
I am confident that today’s interaction will contribute to continue the momentum of our exchange and mutual understanding. This platform should continue to explore new ideas, academic exchange and avenues towards further enhancing Nepal-Russia relations in the coming years. I count on your support and solidarity.
I thank you.

Adopting a nation’s Constitution is a matter of pride for every country and the people living therein. The ratification of the Constitution is a sign that the country has geared up for consolidating the agendas of different political movements in the state. With this spirit, India adopted and enacted its first Constitution on November 26, 1949.
The Constitution of India, which entered into force on January 26, 1950, begins with a preamble with the opening words of “We, the people…” with which the preamble of UN Charter and US Constitution also start. The Preamble, which was adopted on October 17, 1949, is divided into three parts on the basis of its qualitative characteristics, viz., declarative; revolutionary and promissory. In other words, preamble broadly reflects three things: the source of the Constitution; objects and goals including rights and freedoms for Indian citizens living under the Constitution and the date of adoption of the Constitution.
This way, ‘the preamble reflected the changes that had come over the country as a result of the partition and integration of the Indian states’, said KM Munshi, member of the Constituent Assembly of India.
Facts:

Constitution of India adopted and enacted on November 26, 1949
Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950
Constituent Assembly met in sessions for 166 days
It took 2 years 11 months 18 days to give birth to the lengthiest Constitution of the world
It features 395 Articles, divided into 22 parts and 12 Schedules
Now, its home to 448 Articles in 25 parts and 12 Schedules
Chief architect of Indian Constitution: Dr BR Ambedkar
Chief advisor: Sir BN Rao

Despite these things, the Constitution of India would not have evolved like US Constitution or other Constitutions of the world unless there was a brave Supreme Court put in place to work as guardian of the Constitution. The apex Court of India played an instrumental role in advancing the cause of judicial review and constitutionalism. If facts and figures are something to stand by, India’s neighbors have experimented with many Constitutions to consolidate the democratic credentials. But India adopted a Constitution and she does not wish to compete with her neighbors in enacting the number of Constitutions. Pakistan adopted its first Constitution in 1956, second in 1962 and third in 1973. Similarly, Nepal has experimented with seven Constitutions in 70 years with first in 1948, second in 1951, third in 1959, fourth in 1962, fifth in 1990, sixth in 2007 and seventh in 2015.
There are series of cases where the apex Court of India has responded firmly to give effect to the cause of constitutionalism.
The question whether the word ‘law’ in Article 13 also includes ‘constitutional amendments’ was for the first time considered by the Supreme Court in Shankari Prasad v. Union of India (AIR 1951). The Court held that the word law defined under Article 13(3) did not include law made by parliament under Article 368 [amendment clause]. This interpretation of Shankari Prasad’s case was followed by the majority in Sajjan Singh v State of Rajasthan (1965).  But the top Court laid down a differing view in IC Golakhnath v. State of Punjab (1967) by overruling its decisions pronounced in the aforesaid two cases. It was held that the word ‘law’ in Article 13 did include an amendment to the Constitution passed under Article 368.
Miffed with the verdict of the court, the Indian parliament passed the Constitution (24th Amendment) Act, 1971 to nullify the ruling of IC Golakhnath case. This amendment inserted Clause (4) in Article 13 and Clause (3) in Article 368 to the effect, “Nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article 368.” The Constitutionality of this amendment was upheld by the Supreme Court in Keshvanand Bharati v. State of Kerala (AIR 1973). It thus laid the controversy to rest. It follows that the term “law” in Article 13 excludes an amendment of the Constitution made under Article 368.
The Keshvanand Bharati case is one of the finest judgments of Supreme Court of India which brought a new constitutional dawn in India.
However, the Keshvanand Bharati case is one of the finest judgments of Supreme Court of India which brought a new constitutional dawn in India. The Court offered a long list of features as basic structure of Indian Constitution which can neither be amended nor be nullified by the parliament. The supremacy of Constitution; republic and democratic form of government; secular form of government; separation of power; federal character of constitution; unity and integrity of nation; sovereignty of India; democratic character of policies of India; individual freedoms; or welfare state were held to be the basic structure of Indian Constitution, meaning thereby the parliament of India is not competent to amend or nullify these foundations of Indian Constitution.
In Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narayan, the Supreme Court added rule of law; judicial review; democracy and fair election; and objectives mentioned in preamble as basic structures of Indian Constitution.
In L Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997), the apex Court of India held that clause 2 (d) of Article 323A and clause 3 (d) of Article 323B to the extent they exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court and Supreme Court under Articles 226, 227 and 32 would be unconstitutional and for the same reason Section 28 of Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985 which contains the “exclusion of jurisdiction” clause also held unconstitutional. With this, the apex Court held that the decisions of tribunal can be challenged before the Division Bench of High Court. It is to be noted here that Article 323 A (2d) and Article 323B (3d) were inserted through amendment in Constitution to curtail the power of High Court. But these two provisions were held ultra-vires to the Constitution by the apex Court. In doing so, the Court expanded the horizon of judicial review. Now, the power of judicial review cannot be abrogated even by the amendment of Constitution.

Recently, Ayodhya verdict too could be taken as one of the landmark judgments. The Court succeeded to put the controversies at rest by paving the ways for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya. The court relied on documentary evidences, travelogues and others to arrive at a conclusion. This too conforms that the people have faith on judiciary. They consider judicial department as the last resort. India believes that the Supreme Court is there to prevail constitutionalism over undemocratic acts.
This year India celebrates 70th Constitution Day. The Supreme Court of India has played an instrumental role in strengthening the constitutional ethos with which Indian democracy is moving forward. Nepal needs to learn from India’s constitutional guarantee of constitutionalism and its longevity. Changing the Constitution every 10 years shows that our leaders lack a long term vision. We need to ensure the durability of this hallowed document.

Recently, the US Ambassador to Nepal Randy Berry visited Janakpurdham, the interim capital of Province-2. During his visit, he enjoyed the taste of famous beverage in Janakpur named Lassi, along with Paan (betel) and even enjoyed the rickshaw ride. The Ambassador enthusiastically expressed his admiration for Lassi in his tweet, “I finally got a chance to enjoy famous Janakpuria Lassi & Paan. Trust me, they were one of the best I ever had!  And the Local Rickshaw ride was unforgettable experience, too!”.
It can be inferred that the tweet of Ambassador Randy vested huge respect towards Janakpuria Lassi and its taste. His appreciation of Lassi’s taste explicitly conveys that the taste of Lassi transcends boundaries. Indeed, the tweet will surely support the “Visit Nepal 2020” campaign, attracting tourists to Janakpur.
Janakpuriya Lassi has gained immense popularity in Kathmandu as well. Many vendors have started selling Lassi with the brand name of “Janakpuriya Lassi” though it differs from the original taste of Janakpuriya Lassi.
Lassi, probably one of the most loved beverages during the summer, is made of yogurt. Lassi is the ultimate summer refresher and is the amalgamation of yogurt, water and spices or sweeteners as well as dry fruits. There are varieties of flavor in Lassi like Sweet Lassi, Salty Lassi, Mango Lassi, Bhang Lassi (mostly made during Holi Festival) and so on. Lassi makes the consumer feel cool in summer heat but it is enjoyed all around the year.
Also from the perspective of health benefits, Lassi aids digestion as the yogurt contains lactobacillus bacteria that lubricates the intestine, breaks down the food, absorbs the nutrients and helps in smooth digestion. Lassi contains healthy bacteria that help keep away the bad bacteria and prevents stomach bloats. It helps make bone stronger and consuming it daily assures good dental health as Lassi is rich in calcium. Lassi also contains Vitamin D and lactic acid which helps boost immunity and maintain youthful skin.
Lassi business can be started with a small capital of around 200,000 rupees with low risk and high-profit potential.  In the Terai Belt, the summers are lengthy, spanning about nine months so we can expect good sales of Lassi every year. A single Lassimaker sells thousands of glasses of Lassi a single day during high summer in Janakpur. Indeed, there is a probability of widening the favorable environment for Lassi business. One of the Lassi vendors told the scribe that the demand of Lassi rises during the festivals like Dashain, Chhaath and other main festivals of Janakpur and revenue is double than in normal days. To ensure brisk sales all year round there is a need to promote Lassi which is the most preferable and special beverage of Janakpur. It’s not only a beverage, rather it contains geographical and cultural identity as well as the emotional attachment.
The provincial and local governments and business forums in Janakpur should promote and encourage Lassi business from tourism, cultural and economic development perspective. They should promote Lassi globally and domestically to fetch domestic as well as international tourists. The central, provincial and local government should highlight the importance of Lassi on their official websites as well as social media platforms. Social media users should promote Lassi from their respective platforms. Even the hotels and restaurants in Janakpur should advertise Lassi and serve it in their hotels. The government should keep the pamphlet of Janakpuria Lassi in both Tribhuvan International Airport as well as domestic airport of Janakpur which will help international as well as domestic tourists to acquire knowledge about it. Every flight for Janakpur from Kathmandu should distribute a pamphlet informing the traveler about Janakpuria Lassi.

Nepal is agitated after the government of India released its political map keeping Kalapani area in its side. Four days after the release of the Indian map, Nepal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) released a press statement objecting to India’s incorporation of Kalapani in its map. However, the press statement seems immature as there is no authorized signature underneath. Similarly, the language used in the statement does not give clear message regarding Nepal’s stance.
Meantime, Raveesh Kumar, Official Spokesperson of Ministry of External Affairs of India, has clearly said that the map released by India is accurate and Kalapani comes under the territory of India. Some Nepali leaders are invoking the Sugauli Treaty of 1816 forged between Nepal and the then East India Company regarding control on Kalapani. Government of Nepal in the face of anti-Indian sentiments should handle the situation smartly and commit to smooth running of Nepal-India relationship.
Three things regarding this dispute need to be pondered upon: vandalism orchestrated by student and youth wings of Nepali Congress (NC) and Nepal Communist Party (NCP), NCP government’s inaction and mysterious silence of Nepal government over Chinese encroachment of Nepali land.
Last week onwards youth leaders of NC and NCP have been demonstrating against the political map of India, objecting to placement of Kalapani inside India. But their modus operandi is quite objectionable. Chanting slogans like “Back off India” and abusing Indian citizens in Nepal are offensive acts. Burning the effigy of Indian Prime Minister and vandalizing the gate of the Embassy of India will not help solve the issue. Such acts of NC and NCP have disgraced Nepali leaders at the global arena. Rather than pouring venom on India, youth leaders of leading political parties should ask their leaders how they allowed Kalapani to be a part of India. What were they doing when China and India came to Kalapani border?
Coinciding with recent brouhaha on Kalapani, several media outlets have published accounts of China encroaching upon Nepali land in Sankhuwasabha, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Humla districts. A news website in Nepal has mentioned that ‘around six hectors of land in the Bhagdare River in Humla district and four hectors of land in Karnali have been encroached upon by China’. The news portal has published the news story on the basis of data obtained from Department of Survey. Nepal’s silence over Chinese aggression is deafening. The scribe does not intend to say that Nepal can allow any country to encroach upon its land just because another country has done it. However, staking claim of Nepali sovereignty must not be selective.

The reason for Nepal government not being able to stand its ground is because of Chinese domination. China also has its deep concerns regarding Kalapani, Lipu-lekh and Limpiyadhura dispute. In such scenario, Nepal speaking up can ire China as well. Those areas are immensely critical from security point of view and Nepal needs to think twice before taking any steps. It should point out China as an aggressor like India.
I think Nepal government must have known that just a couple of days ago few members of Chinese think tank and director of Shanghai-based China Institute of Fudan were in Nepal and they said that India has encroached upon China’s land too. Is it a good time to organize such dialogue programme in Nepal? Or is this China’s strategy to add fuel to the fire?
Government of Nepal needs to do two major things as soon as possible. First, the government should not allow any unwanted activities against its southern neighbour. The government must be careful to stop any sponsored agitation against India. Second, Prime Minister KP Oli must be serious in commencing dialogue with India rather than uttering irresponsible statements for public consumption.
Nepal should not allow one neighbour to score brownie points against the other. It needs to maintain equidistance with both its neighbours.

The recently released new map of India has stirred an old controversy between India and Nepal over a small 35 sq km disputed area claimed by both countries. India considers Kalapani as part of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district, and Nepal as part of its Darchula district. The recent map, released to depict the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir, has resulted in several protests in Nepal by students’ unions and political parties. The leaders have reached out to Indian officials in Kathmandu. New Delhi, on its part, has maintained that the new map does not revise the existing boundary with Nepal and that it “accurately depicts the sovereign territory of India”. As such, there is no change in the status quo, it says.
The incident brings to the fore two kinds of narratives. The first is one of cartographic aggression, as perceived by most sections in Nepal. The second relates to the larger behaviour of a modern State in its march to consolidating its power and sovereignty. While both these perceptions have been debunked by India on the ground that India only carried out a cartographic depiction of its legitimate and sovereign area on the map and that no violations of Nepal’s sovereignty had taken place, there is a need to debate the issue in the context of its larger implications for bilateral relations between India and Nepal.
It is understandable why Nepal would tend to think so. Power, capabilities and force projection are very closely linked with State behaviour, especially when contested geographies are involved. In the current century, China has led from the front in establishing a predictable relationship between force projection and contested sovereignties. This has induced apprehension among small countries, especially those overwhelmingly close to a big and powerful neighbour. As such, Nepal’s anxiety of India’s cartographic aggression emanates less from concrete developments on the ground and more from the broader trends in State behaviour worldwide.
History of the dispute 
In 1816, the East India Company and Nepal signed the Treaty of Sagauli to mark out Nepal’s western border. The treaty defined river Mahakali as the western border of Nepal. River Mahakali has several tributaries, all of which merge at Kalapani. India claims that the river begins in Kalapani as this is where all its tributaries merge. But Nepal claims that it begins from Lipulekh Pass, the origin of most of its tributaries. It has therefore laid claim to all areas east of the Lipu Gad — the rivulet that joins the river Kali on its border. According to Nepal, the Kalapani area was included in the Census of Nepal until 58 years ago. According to some quarters, the late Nepalese King Mahendra had “handed over the territory” to India in 1962 in the wake of the India-China war. A report submitted on the subject to the Nepali prime minister further claimed that India had occupied an additional 62 sq km land. India on its part has presented administrative and tax records dating back to 1830s to back its claims. A map of 1879 also shows Kalapani as part of British India.
It is interesting to note that this long-standing issue only gained prominence after India and Nepal signed the Treaty of Mahakali in 1996. Both countries have been trying to resolve the issue of Kalapani and another vast area along the Nepal-Uttar Pradesh border, Susta. In 1981, a Joint Technical Boundary Committee was formed. While it could resolve a large part of the dispute, no final settlement could be reached. The progress in the matter has been very slow. In 2014, both countries held a joint commission meeting led by their foreign ministers. In 2016, an Eminent Persons Group was formed to look into several bilateral issues, including the border dispute and the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950. The border issue was escalated in March 2017 when a Nepali was killed as India’s Border Security Forces opened fire in Kanchanpur district, near the Nepal-India border
Incidentally, Kalapani is a trijunction meeting point of India, Tibet and Nepal borders. The region has been manned by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police since 1962. This has led to fear of Chinese involvement also. Nepal has also raised concern over Lipulekh Pass, which has been made a trading tri-junction route between India and China, reportedly without Nepal’s consent, since 2015. The Indian side claims that Lipulekh pass has been referred to as a border trading point since 1954 and that the new positions depict an anti-Indian sentiment to gain greater political mileage.
The flaring up of this issue is bound to add further tension in the India-Nepal relationship. The ties had received an impetus when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014. Nepal was invited as a SAARC member for Modi’s swearing-in ceremony. Modi visited the Himalayan nation soon after announcing his ‘neighbourhood first’ commitment. India was quick to respond to the earthquake that ravaged Nepal in 2015. It is another matter that the narrative from our chest-thumping media drew flak from several quarters. Nepal also continued to blame India for interfering in its internal matters. The relationship deteriorated considerably after the unofficial blockade of Nepal in 2015.
Despite this, India still enjoys great leverage with Nepal. India is Nepal’s largest trading partner, and the two countries are culturally intertwined. In the past, India has played a considerable role in maintaining stability and development in Nepal. As China’s clout grows in the region and India’s tensions with Pakistan exacerbate, India needs friends in the neighbourhood. It is therefore imperative that India manages such incidents with diplomatic finesse so that an anti-India feeling does not emerge among the Nepali leaders and general populace.

Chhangru Village
Kathmandu, 10 November (2019) – Nepali people are angry with the newly published political map of India that shows Nepali territory of Lipu-lekh and Kalapani inside India.
Kalapani, Lipu-lekh and Limpiyadhura are in Byas Rural Municipality of Darchula district in far western province of Nepal. India has illegally encroached upon those lands and has forbidden Nepali people to go there. Nepalis have to obtain a permit card to go to the Nepali territories that are miles away from lands which India has encroached upon.
Many Nepalis do not know the real condition of Kalapani and Lipu-lekh. But India has been in control of these territories for the last six decades. Lokantar has talked with Dilip Budhathoki, Chairperson of Byas Rural Municipality about these forgotten territories. Excerpts follow:
India has issued permit cards
Lipu-lekh and Kalapani are completely under India’s control. They have been in control of these lands since 1962 and Nepal has not made its presence felt.
Chhangru village is some 17 kilometres far from Kalapani and that is the last Nepali village not under India’s control. Chhangru is in Ward no. 1 in Byas Rural Municipality.
We have to obtain permit cards from the Indian administration to go to Chhangru. Nepali citizens cannot enter Kalapani. Indians don’t give pass to go to Kalapani. It is off-limits for Nepali people.
Indian Army and Seema Suraksha Bal have settled in Kalapani. Some civilians are there to do business.
Our roads to Chhangru are bad. So, we have to use Indian roads. It takes a whole day to reach Chhangru from the district headquarters of Darchula. Half the vehicle journey needs to be done through Indian roads while half the journey requires trekking. Once we reach Sitapul (Seeta Bridge) through Indian roads, we have to cross a wooden bridge and then reach Chhangru.
Seeta Bridge
Tinker Pass is above Chhangru. The pillar demarcating Nepal-China border is there. Our business border with China is Tinker Pass.
Nepali roads to Tinker Pass are bad. We can reach there only on foot. Since it is difficult to use mule as beast of burden on these roads, there is no alternative to Indian roads for travel.
Following the local level elections, we have been prioritizing construction of roads to Tinker Pass. But in lack of human settlement and due to geographical difficulty, we have not been able to make roads. That area is vulnerable to floods and landslips in the rainy season.
During India-China War in 1961 the then King Mahendra allowed to Indians to make a temporary base in Kalapani. But India never went away since then. Indian Army has made a permanent base there.
Indian administration’s condescending attitude
No problem exists at the civilian level. People from the same community live both sides of the border.
Indigenous people live in both Chhangru and Tinker and similar people live across the border as well. Local people have cordial relationship but Indian administration shows condescending attitude.
They have not subjected me to any untoward behaviour. But their attitude to Nepali people is not good. There are many complaints regarding India’s patronising tendency.
On Lipu-lekh
Limpiyadhura and Lipu-lekh are also under Indian control. It is believed that Sage Byas wrote some scripts (lipi) at Lipu-lekh before going to Mansarovar to do penance. But these scripts are not available now.
Lipu-lekh is a trilateral border point among Nepal, India and China. But India has encroached upon Nepali territory for decades. They have been using the border point to conduct trade with China.
The zero (0) pillar demarcating trilateral border is missing. People say that it used to exist but we never saw it.
Tinker Village
All eastern lands from Kali River is Nepali territory. Lipu-lekh is the originating place of Kali River. Nepali villages including Kuti, Nabi, Gunji used to be there.
A small stream merges with Kali River in Kalapani and Indians claim that it is the source of Kali River. On this basis they have encroached upon Nepal’s lands westward from that stream.
No security personnel
Armed Police Force has the mandate to protect borders but they don’t go beyond Khalanga, headquarters of Darchula district. Nepal Army’s base in also in the headquarters. Chhayalek Police Station is around a kilometre away from Tinker Village. Police personnel don’t stay there during winter. Even the locals come down for six months during winter.
There is another police outpost in Sitapul. Policemen in Chhayalek have already come down to Sitapul. During high winter, they come down even lower at a place called Dumling.
Nepal remains absent even in Nepali territory for six months.
After getting elected to the post of Rural Municipality Chief, I approached the Ministry of Home Affairs with the demand of erecting armed police post in Chhangru. The Ministry has approved my request but there are delays in erecting the post.
We have demanded a permanent outpost of Armed Police Force in Chhangru.
Kalapani and Lipu-lekh are our territories
India has to correct its map. Nepal Government has to ask the Indian government to amend the map and also ensure Nepal’s permanent presence in Kalapani area. It is the duty of the federal government to protect international border.
The federal government also needs to construct Khalanga-Tinker road so that Nepali people do not have to obtain permit cards from the Indians to go to their own lands.

Lachu Adhikari and his family relocated six years ago to Charlotte from a refugee camp in Nepal.
For the first time in his life, he had a place to call home — a far cry from the cramped bamboo hut he shared with his parents and two younger siblings in a village with no electricity and limited access to running water.
Today, Adhikari, a 20-year-old sophomore at The University of North Carolina at Pembroke, has a new lease on life. But his heart remains with the Nepalese people, especially the children who lack adequate medical care. Adhikari chose UNCP to further his education with the goal of one day returning to his country as a pediatrician.
“As a refugee, you see people dying and suffering from different kinds of disease,” he said. “That’s when I decided, I want to be a doctor to help the children in my community who don’t receive the proper nutrients.”
Adhikari’s journey to UNCP has been nothing short of amazing. He was born at the Beldangi camp in Jhapa near the Indian border. The camp provided water two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon. Oil lamps lit the huts at night. Accidental fires are all too common. Camp volunteers provide education through the 10th grade. After enduring such harsh conditions for 20 years, Adhikari’s parents sought help from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to come to the United States.
At 14, Adhikari couldn’t speak any English when he arrived in Charlotte. With help from volunteers Noel and Karen Sweezy he began applying for colleges while attending Garinger High School.
The culture shock was just beginning to wear off when he packed his belongings for a new culture in Pembroke.
“I chose UNCP because I didn’t want to be too far from my parents,” he said. “The professors here are great. I really enjoy the classes and the student-to-professor ratio. I like the one-on-one time with my professors.”
At UNCP, Adhikari is self-disciplined with regard to his studies, finding little time for leisure outside of the men’s club soccer team and serving as a Braves Ambassador with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
“Right now, I’m focused on getting my BSN degree, then I will begin researching medical schools. I want go back to Nepal at some point, open a clinic and offer free checkups. My people are still recovering from the earthquake in 2015. I can’t just sit back and watch my country suffer.”

When Shyam “San” Rai was 8 years old, he and his family were forced out of Bhutan by the government and relocated to a refugee camp in the nearby nation of Nepal. Food was scarce, he remembers, and survival was hard.
Rai lived in the refugee camp for 22 years before he moved to the United States in 2011. He settled in Utica, New York, dubbed “The Town That Loves Refugees” by the magazine of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
There, he joined many refugees—including others who, like himself, hailed from the countries of Nepal and Bhutan. These two South Asian nations, bordering Tibet, share a population of refugees with mixed ancestry—linked to both Nepal and Bhutan—that has experienced statelessness and discrimination within both countries.
“Some people say, ‘We are Bhutanese because we were born in Bhutan and our nationality is Bhutanese,’” says Rai. “Other people say, ‘Our forefathers are from Nepal, and we speak Nepali, we eat Nepali food, and we celebrate Nepali culture.’”
Rai’s approach to self-naming is common in the Bhutanese Nepali communities of the United States. “It’s flexible. It’s a ‘both-and’ as opposed to an ‘either-or’ identity,” says Andrew Nelson of the University of North Texas, Denton. Nelson and fellow cultural anthropologist Kathryn Stam of the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute, Utica, are studying the roots of this flexibility.
Names often tell a story. And Stam and Nelson have found the names used by the Bhutanese Nepali community are no exception. Some names encode historical migrations, as is the case for the Bhutanese Nepali community. In addition, names can reflect “othering” in which dominant powers seek to differentiate refugees from the rest of a population in a region or nation. Resettlement and citizenship in new lands, meanwhile, present new opportunities for refugees to name themselves.
Bhutanese Nepali naming, then, offers a window into a refugee experience and the community’s century-long narrative of resilience. Today, as vulnerable populations migrate across the globe in search of better lives, that narrative is a timely reminder of the complexity of defining nationality, particularly for groups who have experienced statelessness.
Migration is central to the Bhutanese Nepali refugees’ story. Until 1992, Rai’s parents were farmers in Bhutan. They grew rice and vegetables, such as corn and zucchini, to sell at the market. But his forefathers were originally from Nepal, and Rai grew up speaking Nepali.
In fact, many families migrated from feudalist Nepal to Bhutan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as farmers. There, they were known as Lhotshampas, or “Southerners,” in Bhutan’s national language, Dzongkha, because they lived in southern Bhutan.
But the Bhutanese government, from the late 1970s until the 1990s, made it more difficult for people with Nepali ancestry to remain. Thousands of people relocated to refugee camps in Nepal. Many of these refugees embraced aspects of their ancestral Nepali culture. But they were not fully welcomed in Nepal, despite their roots. Many could not own land or become Nepali citizens. As refugees, they became Bhutanese or “Bhutani,” in the Nepali language, Nelson says.
“Being forced into highly regulated refugee camps in Nepal forged a collective identity which was often in resistance to the larger political structure,” Nelson says. That spirit would contribute to the refugees’ flexibility in naming as they resettled once again.
Since 2007, more than 100,000 Bhutanese refugees moved from Nepal to other countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. A new chapter of migration unfolded in U.S. cities like Utica and Fort Worth as these refugees studied, got jobs, and shared their culture with the wider community.
Rai, for example, took English classes at the refugee center in Utica. He initially worked at a nearby casino before taking his current job at Chobani, the yogurt company, where he cleans production equipment.
Rai also joined a folk band in Utica, playing the madal hand drum and sharing traditional Nepali songs he learned in the refugee camps. For several years, the band played at schools, museums, and cultural festivals sprinkled throughout the hillsides of central New York. Rai and Stam, who managed the group, became friends.
Stam and Nelson have been studying Bhutanese Nepali refugee communities in New York and Texas, respectively, for years. Nelson has interviewed and observed more than 40 families in Fort Worth’s community since 2015.
In his writing, Nelson uses the term Nepali Bhutanese rather than Bhutanese Nepali—though both anthropologists say either order is accurate. (Nelson adds, “This very question is how our work on this topic started!”)
Stam, meanwhile, is the president of the board of the Midtown Utica Community Center, which serves refugees in the area. She has documented several aspects of the resettlement experience in studies and for the Refugees Starting Over project.
“Bhutanese Nepali refugees have this really complicated relationship with identity,” Stam says. She adds that their flexible identity is unique among the many refugee communities living in Utica.
The Karen, for example, may have relocated from Burma, but they dislike being called “Burmese,” in part because it connects them to that nation’s military, which oppressed their ethnic group. Refugees from Somalia, meanwhile, hold rigid rules about the use of names such as Bantu and Kizigua, which reference ethnic groups and their nomadic traditions back in Africa. And they may find it offensive to be called “Somali” because of their history of conflict with this group.
“One generalization that we can make is that the practice of naming or any sort of practice of readjustment when moving into a new society is a political statement of sorts,” Nelson says. “It’s a way of negotiating new structures through strategies.” For the Bhutanese Nepali, these strategies have been developed over multiple migrations.
Names tell a story. The names used by the Bhutanese Nepali community are no exception.
Naming can be strategic, in recognition of a particular audience and its expectations. People may say that they are Nepali because their classmates or co-workers have more familiarity with Nepal than Bhutan, for example.
Sometimes the choice in name reflects specific activities or circumstances. People in these communities may call themselves Nepali when they eat food like dal bhat (a traditional rice and lentil meal) and wear traditional Nepali clothes, Stam notes.
And Stam has noticed a generational fault line in the refugee communities from Nepal and Bhutan. Older refugees born in Bhutan are more likely to prefer identifying as Bhutanese, and they are more likely to talk about the loss of their Bhutanese home and life than younger refugees. They may also, in her observations, be less comfortable with flexible labels than younger refugees.
Rai, 34, says his identity lends itself to very long conversations. Initially, he may tell someone that he is from his birthplace, Bhutan, but then he will explain that he’s from Nepal if that person is eager to know more about his home.
And Rai recognizes other generational shifts underway. He has a 2-year-old son and a newborn daughter; he wants his children to embrace their American roots while still honoring their Nepali culture.
“They belong to the United States, so I think they’re going to say, ‘I’m from the United States,’” says Rai. He hopes his children will speak English and Nepali, and he intends to tell them the story of his early life in Bhutan. “I don’t want them to forget their culture,” he says, echoing a sentiment held by refugees and migrants the world over.

Breathtaking images of snow-capped mountains taken in Nepal’s Nubri Valley, an isolated area 4,000 metres (13,000 feet) above sea level in the Himalayas bordering Tibet, cover the windows of Cathryn Donohue’s room at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).
“Mount Manaslu is the world’s eighth tallest peak and it’s so beautiful, especially when the sun lights it up like a volcano,” says Donohue, assistant professor of the university’s linguistics department, pointing to a picture of the mountain that presides over the valley. “Nubri Valley is on the Manaslu circuit trek, and while it’s not on travellers’ radar like the well-worn Annapurna circuit in central Nepal, it’s getting more popular.”
Donohue, an Australian who has been to the Nubri Valley about eight times, is well informed about the place and the Nubri people, who are believed to have settled in the valley from Tibet about 400 years ago. But her speciality is the language of Nubri, spoken only by about 2,000 ethnically Tibetan people and which has no written form.
“A quarter of the population in Nubri Valley is monolingual – there’s no English, no Nepali,” she says.
She explains that it is the isolation of the area – which was hit by a powerful earthquake in 2015 that either damaged or destroyed 80 per of the homes in its villages – that has long protected the Nubri language from being influenced by the national language.
“It’s very remote, about a week’s walk from one end to the other. The trek is challenging – narrow and steep – and unless you’re carrying something heavy like rice that requires mules, then it’s walking all the way, usually climbing about 500 metres a day.”
But changing times means the Nubri people’s language is under threat, with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) having it on its list of “definitely endangered” languages – meaning its future is uncertain.
One of the main reasons is societal change as a growing number of young people swap a traditional life of subsistence farming in the valley for school in the capital, Kathmandu, where Nepali is the language of instruction.
“Following in their parents’ footsteps and working on farms, or wearing traditional dress – this is not the lifestyle the younger generation wants, and it’s this change that is bringing about the language shift towards Nepali,” Donohue says. “For young people, Nepali represents all the socioeconomic opportunities they would not have if they stayed in the valley.”
Technology is also fuelling the shift, as more young people use Nepali and English on smartphones and social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook.
“Nubri has no written language, which means it’s very easy to lose. In fact it’s possible that in a generation the language will be gone,” Donohue says, adding that currently, on average, a language is lost once every fortnight worldwide.
Understanding the vital role language plays in a culture and its identity, Donohue was determined to help preserve Nubri by introducing a writing system, a proven step towards language preservation and improved literacy.
“It could be a cool secret language and could be something to latch on to as part of their identity. Something the people of the valley can be proud of,” she says.
The Nubri Language Project was born, with Donohue taking on the role of language diplomat as a “passive observer”.
“Obviously, I’m not going to tell young Nubris to adopt the way of life of previous generations. And nobody would deny them the opportunities in front of them,” she says. “But the big challenge is how to move forward in a way that’s inevitable while retaining a language.”
Creating and documenting a community-endorsed written language had its challenges, the biggest of which was finding a way to bring together villagers who were scattered across locations four to five days’ trek apart.
“A writing system is only successful if the whole community is on board. We needed to give villagers a reason to come together and discuss how we could create this writing system, to provide an incentive.”
That’s when Donohue had a light-bulb moment: to create the valley’s first eye clinic project, specialising in the screening and removal of cataracts, a condition that causes clouding of the eye’s natural lens and results in blurred vision.
“Health care services in the valley are poor and I noticed a lot of elderly people had cataracts that were not treated because financial or physical constraints prevented them from making the long and expensive journey to Kathmandu. Plus there were other issues, like who would look after the land and animals while the farmers made the two-to-three-week round trip?
“Setting up free and more conveniently located eye clinics throughout the valley was a unique opportunity for these farmers.”
Logistics also proved challenging, but the path was smoothed when one of Donohue’s previous projects, in Bhutan, where she studied the Bumthang language, led to a connection with respected Nepalese ophthalmologist Dr Sanduk Ruit.
Known locally as the “God of Sight”, Ruit has restored the vision of more than 130,000 people across Africa and Asia using small-incision cataract surgery. He is also a founder of the Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology in Kathmandu.
“Dr Ruit is well known for his outreach work in Africa and I was so happy that he and the Tilganga Institute agreed to do the project,” Donohue says.
“It was such a blessing to have someone of his calibre get involved. If he was not on board it would have been a long process involving a lot of administration work arranging overseas medical permits and paperwork – a real nightmare. But it all fell into place and I now count these familiar faces as friends and not just distant colleagues. It really could not have worked out better.”
In May, a team of ophthalmologists, with financial support from an HKU grant, packed helicopters with equipment and medicine and set up six free clinics for eye care and cataract surgery throughout the valley.
“The team was familiar with the conditions in these remote villages and how to prep for surgery – it took a whole day just to sterilise one room for surgery,” Donohue says. “And because the doctors and their team were from Kathmandu, and not outsiders, it was easy for patients to respond.”
Almost 500 patients from the valley were screened for cataracts and other ailments, resulting in cataract removal surgery for 51 villagers. Cataract surgery involves replacing the cloudy lens with an artificial one, done under local anaesthetic.
“People came from all over the valley, some walking for days,” Donohue says. “Some were blind in both eyes, and were carried by family members.” One 78-year-old woman who underwent cataract surgery had been blind for six years. To get to the clinic, her nephew carried her on his back for five days.
Agreeing on a common written language was another challenge, one complicated by dialect variation within the valley that had been recently discovered. It is a slow and methodical process, Donohue says, one that calls for cultural sensitivity and diplomacy.
“The community as a whole had to endorse and agree which writing system would best suit the whole region, and bringing people together via the clinics made this possible.”
Donohue’s ongoing work has catalogued the only recorded samples of the language.
“I have a lot of recordings but it takes time transcribing Nubri and English. There will be video with subtitles – eventually it will be deposited in an archive.”
Like her brother, renowned linguist Mark Donohue – who has worked on languages of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Nepal and Bhutan – Donohue’s focus has long been on Sino-Tibetan languages. One project she is working on is close to Hong Kong’s heart.
“I’m working on some indigenous Hong Kong dialects that existed before what we know as Cantonese,” she says. “I want to understand the social factors behind language change, in particular loss. I love studying tone, so Hong Kong is perfect for me.”

For some thinking Indians, President Xi Jinping flying straight from Chennai to Kathmandu was provocative, even an affront to India. This is incomprehensible. Nepal has been waiting for Xi since 2014, his trips being periodically postponed. He had been waiting for the right timing: For Nepal to have a full-fledged communist government with a massive and unprecedented electoral majority that would allow the Nepal Communist Party leader and prime minister, Khadga Prasad Oli, to pick Beijing over New Delhi, the dominant power for decades. India’s marginalisation in Nepal — which is geo-strategically vital in its security calculus — is largely self-inflicted: Clumsy diplomacy. In his first term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose Nepal for his first visit, when he mesmerised Nepalis of all shades with his promise of resetting India-Nepal relations. That never happened and the rest is history.
Then, Xi came calling. His visit was meticulously planned: Preceded by visits of foreign minister Wang Yi, a 40-member delegation of the Communist Party of China, carrying Xi Jinping Thought for exchanges with Nepal’s Communist Party, and, a signed article by Xi which appeared in Nepali newspapers, tracing the historical and cultural links in the China-Nepal relationship which he wished to upgrade to long-term strategic and security cooperation. He pledged to safeguard Nepal’s national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. The entire Nepal cabinet, led by Oli and president Bidya Bhandari, was present to give a reception no foreign visitor has received in recent times.
As in the past, the deliverables in the 18 agreements and two letters of exchange were not as spectacular as was expected. Boundary Management Systems — which helps insulate China’s northern reaches with Nepal — is a perennial issue relating to the illegal passage of Tibetans. China’s main security concern relates to anti-China activities by 20,000 Tibetans living in Nepal who are virtually under lockdown during such visits. Mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, which Beijing hopes will ultimately result in an extradition treaty, figured prominently. Xi also announced a financial assistance package of $495 mn for the next two years which India will find difficult to match. Already China has overtaken India in FDI to Nepal which was about $300 mn in 2018. The feasibility study for Cross Himalayan Connectivity Network of a railway from Kyirong to Kathmandu was approved.
This will ultimately be extended via Pokhara to Lumbini in Terai as the China-Nepal Economic Corridor component of the Belt and Road Initiative. A preliminary study by China Railway First Survey and Design Institute Group Co Ltd has noted formidable technical, geological, scientific and engineering challenges to this, including its security along with high costs and risks that far outweigh the benefits. One estimate puts the cost of the Kathmandu-Kyirong section which includes a 28 km tunnel at $2.7 bn. The question of funding invokes in the minds of the Nepalese, the Hambantota debt trap. A railway line from Lhasa to Kathmandu, unless it reaches the border with India, makes little commercial sense. On the other hand, it will raise strategic doubts and uncertainties between New Delhi and Beijing given the taut state of current relations.
Nepal, of course, does not view the CNEC as a threat but an opportunity for it to play the bridge between the two fastest growing economies, China and India. King Prithvi Narayan Shah, founder of Nepal, had said in 1770 that Nepal is a root vegetable between two big boulders, calling for balance and equidistance, which has never been possible. Given the great rise of China, and its involvement in Nepal’s domestic politics, Kathmandu may be forced to make major strategic choices. In the past, former prime ministers, Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda and Babu Ram Bhattarai, had sought to encourage India to join the triangular India-Nepal-China grouping. In 2016, at Kathmandu’s behest, the three countries did discuss it. But India shied away, preferring to deal bilaterally with Nepal like other countries in the neighbourhood. After Wuhan, then Chinese Ambassador to India, Luo Zhaohui had mooted ‘China-India-plus one’ as a new model, as the two countries agreed to jointly train Afghan diplomats. He was aiming for India-China-Nepal; the idea regurgitated by Xi was to also include Pakistan as plus one.
In his banquet speech, Xi emphasised that the Cross-Himalayan Connectivity Network will help Nepal become land-linked from land-locked with additional entry points, alluding to reducing dependence on India. According to Chinese media, Xi told Oli that anyone attempting to split China will have “crushed bodies and shattered bones”, an unveiled message for “splittists” — Hong Kong included. Xi chose Nepal, a country which has sought to be a zone of peace, because it is regarded as a window to Tibet.
Given its new pre-eminence in Nepal and deep pockets, Beijing has sought parity with India including enhanced defence and military cooperation as part of the new blueprint in Nepal-China relations, which, for the first time, have become strategic. The CNEC is more strategic than economic, especially its envisaged outreach to Lumbini which will breach India’s red line on Chinese activities in Nepal. New Delhi has completed its feasibility study of a railway line from Raxaul to Kathmandu. How the Kathmandu-Kyirong rail will connect with the Indian section to the south, given the different railway gauges, is unclear. The Indian military still views a PLA challenge, both overt and covert, through Nepal to the strategic Indo-Gangetic plains, as very real. Very recently, a conference was held by the Army to consider the military implications of China’s enhanced presence and influence in Nepal.
Xi’s dream — to be the sole leader of the Asian century — is attainable: By keeping India anchored to the region using Pakistan, even as Beijing, assisted by Kathmandu, blocks New Delhi’s traditional strategic space in Nepal. But, not all is lost for India. Geography, including the open border, for one, is in India’s favour. Winning back Nepal and the confidence of its people is the challenge.

Kathmandu, 25 November (2019) – In a series of debates and talk programs designed to stimulate thinking and get the ideas and knowledge flowing, on Sunday a joint event was organized by the French Embassy in Nepal and BEED Knowledge Center on the “Future of Compassion in the context of Artificial Intelligence and Technology” in which the French Buddhist monk and writer, Matthieu Ricard, was in conversation with Sujeev Shakya.
During the conversation, Ricard admired the resilience of Nepali people as they get through everything in life. There has not been lasting hatred and believes that it is a part of the Nepali culture.
Ricard highlighted that a common platform, even before religion, is goodness and a good heart which is most needed for people to come together despite the challenges of technology.  In Ricard’s point of view, artificial intelligence is a method of calculation and not a being and hence no element of experience.
For Sujeev, a lot of evolution has taken place over the years and although Buddhism and science have evolved to come together, it has always been about the human mind and people.  Sujeev emphasized that, technology has encroached our life in an unprecedented level, resulting a conflict with our notion of a shared world and a shared future.
The conversation started with the French Ambassador to Nepal, Mr. François – Xavier LEGER giving the opening remarks.
The conversation would be available online at the Embassy’s and BEED’s websites in the beginning of December.
The attendees included Heads of Mission and representatives from various embassies, researchers, students and people from the private sector.
The French Embassy and the BEED Knowledge Center thank Bidhata KC for providing the art works, Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha for curating and Karuna-Shechan for supporting the event as well as Hotel Himalaya for kindly hosting the event.

China is encroaching into Nepal’s land through an ongoing road expansion project in Tibet, Nepal’s Survey Department has said.
A detailed report issued by the department said that around 36 hectors of land in four different districts, including Sankhuwasabha, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Humla, which touch the Chinese border.
A data revealed that around six hectors of land in the Bhagdare River in the Humla district and four hectors of land in Karnali district have been encroached upon that now falls in Tibet’s Furang area.
Similarly, around six hectares of Nepali land in Sanjen River and Jambhu Khola of Rasuwa, have also fallen into Kerung in southern Tibet.
China has also encroached more than 10 hectares of land in Sindhupalchowk district’s Bhotekoshi and Kharanekhola areas those are now under Nyalam area of Tibet, the report said.
In Sankhuwasabha, nine hectors of land have been encroached due to the road expansion in the autonomous region of Tibet where areas around Kamukhola, Arun River and Sumjung River now has fallen into Tingisyan County area.
With this, the survey data further divulged that some places near the Arun Khola, Kamu Khola and Sumjung now also fallen into Tibet’s Tingisyan area.
According to the ministry’s data, Nepal would lose several hundred hectares of land.
The survey was released following a tense situation between India and Nepal over a new map showing Kalapani in Uttarakhand.
However, after a strong objection by the Nepali government, the Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday said that the new political map released by India after bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir accurately depicts its sovereign territory and did not revise its boundary with Nepal in any manner.
Responding to a question on the same, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said that the boundary delineation with Nepal is ongoing under the existing mechanism and New Delhi is committed to finding a solution on the matter through dialogue in the spirit of the close and friendly bilateral relations between the two countries.
“Our map accurately depicts the sovereign territory of India. The new map has, in no manner, revised our boundary with Nepal. The boundary delineation exercise with Nepal is ongoing under the existing mechanism. We reiterate our commitment to find a solution through dialogue in the spirit of our close and friendly bilateral relation,” he said.

Nepal on Wednesday objected to a new map released by India that places the disputed area of Kalapani within Delhi’s borders, saying it was “clear” the territory belonged to Kathmandu.
On Saturday, India released the new map following its decision to split the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two administrative territories.
On the map, India’s border cuts into Kalapani — long a source of contention between the two countries, particularly because Indian troops have been deployed in the area for more than 50 years.
Nepal “is committed to protecting its international border,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
“Any border-related issue relating to the two friendly countries needs to be resolved through diplomatic channels on the basis of historical documents and evidence.”
“The Nepal government will not accept any unilateral decision,” it added.
An 1816 treaty established Nepal’s western boundary with India along the Kali River, but border disputes have arisen over a discrepancy between the two sides over where the source of the river is located.
Rajan Bhattarai, the foreign relations advisor to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, said a solution would be sought through talks.
“We have to verify the authenticity of the map and examine the borderline from our concerned authorities and experts. Then we will start talks using our diplomatic channels,” Bhattarai told AFP.

Kathmandu, 31 October (2019) – Pakistan Embassy on Thursday organized a talk programme on “Jammu Kashmir Dispute and Recent Developments” to commemorate the Kashmir Black Day.
The two-hour long programme was attended by about hundred and fifty intellectuals, writers and analysts as well as representatives of human rights organizations.
Ambassador Mazhar Javed recounted the historical perspective of the dispute and the Kashmiris’ struggle for their right of self determination which had been promised to them under several UN Security Council resolutions.
The Ambassador highlighted the human rights violations taking place in Indian Occupied Kashmir after Indian Government’s illegal decision to revoke Article 370 on August 5, which Ambassador Javed said, violated the UN resolutions. The people of Jammu Kashmir have been subjected to inhuman curfew, thousands of arbitrary detentions mostly of teenagers, nights raids, rape, torture and clampdown on internet and cell phone.
Speaking at the event, Dr. Surendra KC expressed serious concern on the media / information blockade, use of pellet guns and arrest of Kashmiri leadership. India has come under serious criticism by UN High Commissioner on Human Rights and other international human rights organizations for its repressive measures in the disputed territory.
It was noted at the talk programme that holding of the UN Security Council meeting in August to discuss the Jammu Kashmir dispute had conclusively negated the Indian propaganda that Kashmir was its internal issue. Kashmir dispute was an international dispute which needed to be resolved according to UN Security Council Resolutions.
Talk by speakers was followed by an interactive session. Two documentaries, one on the genesis of the dispute and the other on international reactions to ongoing human rights violations in Indian Occupied Kashmir were screened.
Unresolved status of Jammu and Kashmir dispute has posed the biggest challenge to peace in South Asia, ever since the two countries came into being in 1947 and the UN Security Council passed several resolutions for resolving the dispute in accordance with the wishes of the people of Jammu Kashmir.
 
Message by The Prime Minister of Pakistan on Kashmir Black Day 27th OCTOBER, 2019
 
The Kashmir Black Day being observed in Pakistan and across the world today is distinct from the past. On 27 October 1947, India had illegally occupied Jammu & Kashmir, and, on 5 August 2019, it took further steps to unilaterally alter the disputed status of the territory and change its demographic structure and identity. Pakistan, the Kashmiris and the Muslim Ummah, have categorically rejected this travesty of law and justice.
Since 5 August 2019, the scale and intensity of the Indian government’s human rights violations have increased several-folds. Through the deployment of additional troops and an unprecedented media and communications blackout, that has continued for almost three months, Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IOJ&K) has been turned into the largest prison on the planet. There is a shortage of medicines and essential food items. Thousands have been arbitrarily detained. Thousands of young boys have been abducted, incarcerated in undisclosed locations, and subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment. The Indian state-terrorism has turned even more atrocious.
The world community, international human rights organizations and the international media are calling India out on this tyranny. The façade of India being the so-called ‘largest democracy’ stands fully exposed.
Pakistan demands the immediate lifting of the curfew and communications blackout as well as rescinding of India’s illegal and unilateral actions. We urge the international community to play its role in ensuring respect for the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the Kashmiri people and averting grave risks to peace and security posed by India’s irresponsible actions.
We express our unshakable solidarity with the people of occupied Jammu & Kashmir and assure our Kashmiri brothers and sisters that Pakistan will always be shoulder-to-shoulder with them. Pakistan will continue its full moral, political and diplomatic support until the Kashmiri people realize their legitimate right to self-determination in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the applicable UN Security Council resolutions.
 
 
Message by the President of Pakistan on Kashmir Black Day – 27th October, 2019
27th October marks one of the darkest chapters in the history of Jammu & Kashmir. On this day, seventy-two years ago, Indian security forces landed in Srinagar to occupy, oppress and terrorize the innocent people of Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IOJ&K) in blatant violation of international law and morality.
The United Nations Security Council through several of its resolutions has upheld the fundamental right of the Kashmiri people to decide their own future through a fair and impartial plebiscite held under the UN auspices. Reneging on its repeated commitments to the international community to implement these resolutions, India has continued on the path of brutal suppression of the Kashmiri people to this day.
Since 5 August 2019 India has imposed an inhuman lockdown over 8 million people in IOJ&K Use of torture, enforced disappearances and restrictions on freedom of movement and assembly are the stark realities today. Indian Occupation forces are perpetrating unspeakable crimes against the Kashmiri people, including women and children, with complete impunity. The indefensible curfew and communications blackout, going on for nearly three months now, is illustrative of the state-terrorism that India has wreaked on innocent Kashmiris for decades. No matter how brutal its policies and tactics, India cannot crush the spirit of the Kashmiri people.
Today, we pay homage to the martyrs for the cause of Kashmir and honour all those who have suffered at the hands of Indian occupying forces. Pakistan reaffirms its unflinching moral, political and diplomatic support to the people of Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir with the solemn pledge that this will continue until the realization of their legitimate right to self-determination.

A Nepali climber has reached the summit of the world’s 14 highest mountains in just over six months, setting a record for a feat that took other climbers years to complete.
The climber, Nirmal Purja, 36, completed his goal early Tuesday morning when he reached the top of Shishapangma in Tibet along with a Sherpa team.
“Mission Achieved!” was the simple message he relayed in a post on social media.
 

“MISSION ACHIEVED !” says @nimsdai from the summit of #Shishapangma #14peaks7months #History
At 8:58 hrs local time, Nims and his team reached the summit of Shisha Pangma. Team Members includes: Mingma David Sherpa, Galjen Sherpa and Gesman Tamang.#BremontProjectPossible pic.twitter.com/PeYUVQ7RnL
— Nirmal Purja MBE (@nimsdai) October 29, 2019

“It has been a grueling but humbling six months, and I hope to have proven that anything is possible with some determination, self-belief and positivity,” Mr. Purja said in a statement.
A spokesman for Seven Summit Treks, a Nepal-based company that helped organize some of Mr. Purja’s expeditions, said by phone that it was in touch with his climbing team and confirmed that he had reached the top of Shishapangma.
The attempt to be the fastest to reach the top of all the world’s known mountains over 8,000 meters, or about 26,350 feet, which Mr. Purja called Project Possible, started in April, when he scaled Annapurna. He then quickly tackled the 13 remaining mountains, all of which are in the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges that stretch across China, India, Nepal and Pakistan.
Climbing the world’s 8,000ers, as they are known, requires time in the so-called death zone, an altitude at which reduced oxygen levels make it difficult for humans to breathe effectively and where climbers can die.
The previous speed record for scaling all 14 peaks was held by Kim Chang-ho of South Korea, who completed his climbs in seven years, 10 months and six days. He narrowly broke an earlier record held by Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland, who took seven years, 11 months and 14 days.
Mr. Kim later died in a storm on the Mount Gurja in Nepal, and Mr. Kukuczka died in 1989 while trying to scale the south face of Lhotse in Nepal.
A member of Mr. Purja’s team said she was still awaiting news of a safe descent, and said he would be out of contact for several hours while he made his way back down the mountain.
Mr. Purja drew worldwide attention to his attempt in May, when he posted a photo of a traffic jam of climbers near the summit of Mount Everest.
Mr. Purja managed to reach the top of Everest — a climb he has made several times — but it was an exceptionally deadly season on the world’s tallest peak, with 11 people dying during the window of several weeks with favorable conditions for climbing. At the time, he spoke from Everest base camp about the risks associated with climbing at such high altitudes.
“The mountains draw people, always have and always will,” he said in a message. “Everest is the highest mountain and has the highest draw. You can’t blame climbers for wanting to summit. You can’t blame guides for leading them.”
He said an exceptionally short climbing window also limited the days that climbers could make a final push to the summit.
But he noted that some people were taking unnecessary risks and said that the number of permits, expeditions, guides and climbers needed to be better regulated.
“The most important thing is safety — every person on the mountain, not just your own,” Mr. Purja said.
The government of Nepal is planning new restrictions on permits to climb Mount Everest in an effort to limit traffic on the mountain. Mr. Purja took part in four unplanned rescues during his attempt at the 14 climbs.
He said the idea to try to break the 14-summit record came to him in 2017 when he achieved three speed records on peaks above 8,000 meters.
That year, Mr. Purja achieved the fastest consecutive climbs of Everest, Lhotse and Makalu, in a total of five days; the fastest time from the summit of Everest to the summit of Lhotse, in 10 hours 15 minutes; and he was the first person to reach the summit of Everest twice, Lhotse once and Makalu once in a single push, taking a total of 17 days.
“On completion of these I felt tired, but not completely drained,” he said. “This got me thinking about my physiology and what I could achieve if I really pushed myself.”
High-altitude mountaineering can be expensive, with costs for equipment and guides costing tens of thousands of dollars. Mr. Purja said he had found it difficult early on to obtain sponsorship for his attempt, but eventually the luxury British watchmaker Bremont financed his efforts.
Nick English, a co-founder of the watch brand, offered his “huge congratulations” to Mr. Purja on Tuesday.
“I don’t think we will see it again in our lifetime,” Mr. English wrote in a post on social media.
Mr. Purja credits his endurance to his natural physiology and to his intense military training. He had served in the British armed forces for 16 years before leaving to attempt the record, including 10 years in the special forces. He was a member of the Brigade of Gurkhas — a unit made up of Nepali citizens that has been part of the British military for more than 200 years.
“I looked at the logistical problems that climbing all these peaks posed and worked out they can be achieved in one season,” he said in an earlier message. “Many people have the physiology but I believe my experiences as a member of the U.K. special forces unit — the Special Boat Service — gives me an unequaled edge.”

Kathmandu 14 October (2019) – Chinese President Xi Jinping’s just-concluded visit to Nepal will boost the friendship between the two neighboring countries and elevate bilateral relations, Nepali scholar Yubaraj Sangroula told Xinhua Sunday.
Sangroula, a professor with the Purbanchal University, also expected the visit to bring more opportunities for the economic and social development in Nepal.
“Nepal and China are good neighbors and friends,” he said. “We have been good friends and we will remain good friends.”
Xi’s visit would open a new chapter for the two countries’ relations, he said, adding “his visit is a prelude to development in the next 20 years.”
Sangroula, who is the former attorney general of Nepal, now chairs the Kathmandu School of Law and has researched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
He said that since Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation within the BRI framework in 2017, bilateral cooperation in trade, investment, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges has been deepened at a fast pace.
Achievements of the cooperation could be seen everywhere, he noted, from made-in-China products used by Nepalis in their daily life, to the jobs created thanks to Chinese investments, to the agriculture, telecom and infrastructure construction sectors using Chinese technology.
More people are learning Chinese now, including himself, Sangroula said. “Nepal could really benefit from China’s development.”
China and Nepal agreed on Saturday to upgrade their relations to a strategic partnership of cooperation featuring ever-lasting friendship for development and prosperity.
Sangroula believed that Xi’s visit could deepen Nepal’s participation in the BRI, bring opportunities to his country and boost its development.
Though being a small country, Nepal “contains immensely bigger natural resources,” he said.
The trans-Himalayan connectivity network, a gigantic infrastructure program undertaken by the two countries, could help upgrade the roads, railway system and aviation in Nepal, and better logistics would then benefit the agriculture and industry sectors, improve economic structure and boost export, he told Xinhua.
“Developing the China-Nepal economic corridor is considered immensely vital for transforming Nepal into an economically developed nation and dependable neighbour,” said the professor, adding that Nepal could be a bridge between China and South Asia for regional development.
Talking about the BRI, he said: “it is the most precious gift given by China to the world,” suggesting that the Nepali government put forward more plans to seize the opportunities that the BRI generates for rapid development.
“Nepal’s future is bright if the Nepalese people stand together and work for their prosperity by taking advantage of China’s mammoth economic development,” he said.

Kathmandu, 13 October (2019) – Chinese President Xi Jinping’s trip to India and Nepal has injected new impetus into China’s relations with the two countries, built new platform for good-neighborliness in South Asia, and opened up new prospects for regional practical cooperation, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday.
Xi returned to Beijing on Sunday evening after his second informal meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the southern Indian city of Chennai and a state visit to Nepal.
Enhancing China-India strategic mutual trust
During Xi’s stay in India, the Chinese president had a long and in-depth exchange of views with Modi, Wang said, adding that the two leaders recollected the history of China and India fighting side by side for national independence and liberation, and pioneering the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and envisioned the future of the two countries jointly realizing their respective national dreams.
Xi said both China and India, as two populous countries, the two largest developing countries and important representatives of emerging economies, are at a critical stage of national development and national rejuvenation, with huge potential and broad space for cooperation, according to Wang.
Xi added that China-India relations have transcended the bilateral scope and bear important and far-reaching strategic significance.
China and India should be good neighbors who live in harmony and work together as good partners, Xi said, noting that realizing a scenario where the dragon and the elephant dance together is the only correct choice for the two countries, which serves the fundamental interests of both countries and peoples, and works for world peace and prosperity.
Wang said the two leaders have charted out targets and directions for strengthening practical cooperation between China and India.
They have agreed to establish a high-level economic and trade dialogue mechanism, enhance alignment of the two countries’ economic development strategies, seek to build a partnership in manufacturing industry, and promote balanced and sustainable growth of bilateral trade.
The two leaders also agreed to expand “China-India Plus” cooperation, push forward facilitation of regional inter-connectivity, and work with other related parties to strike the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement as early as possible, Wang said.
China and India have agreed to strengthen coordination within the framework of multilateral mechanisms including the Group of 20, the BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the China-Russia-India cooperation, and safeguard an international system with the United Nations as its core and an international order based on international law, Wang said, adding that the two countries vowed to uphold multilateralism and maintain multilateral trading system.
Xi also called on the two countries to conduct broader and deeper cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and jointly advocate and push forward dialogue and exchanges among different civilizations, so as to continue to create new glory for Asian civilizations, Wang said.
The two countries have agreed to designate 2020 as the China-India year of cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and hold 70 events next year to mark the 70th anniversary of the China-India diplomatic relations.
Deepening traditional China-Nepal friendship
Over the past more than half a century since the establishment of China-Nepal diplomatic ties, the two countries have respected, trusted and supported each other, serving as an example for countries with different sizes to live in harmony, said Wang, adding that Nepal is an important partner of China in the joint construction of the Belt and Road in South Asia.
In the first state visit to Nepal by a Chinese head of state in 23 years, Xi and the leaders of Nepal jointly planned for the future development of bilateral relations, and witnessed the signing of 20 cooperation documents concerning various areas of the national interest and people’s livelihood, Wang said.
Bilateral relations between the two countries have also been lifted to a new height, said Wang, noting that China and Nepal have agreed to upgrade their relations to a strategic partnership of cooperation featuring ever-lasting friendship for development and prosperity.
Such a new positioning helps chart the course for the future development of bilateral relations, Wang said.
The Nepali side said they stand firm in upholding the one-China policy and will never allow any force to use its territory for separatist activities against China. No matter how external circumstances change, Nepal’s friendly policy toward China will remain unchanged.
Connectivity construction between the two sides has made new progress, Wang said.
Leaders of the two countries have agreed to align the China-Nepal co-construction of the Belt and Road with Nepal’s national development strategy of building itself a land-linked country.
Wang said that the two countries will accelerate the building of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network through connectivity projects including ports, highways, railways, aviation and communications, and have announced the launch of a feasibility study of the China-Nepal cross-border railway.
The good-neighborly and friendly cooperation between the two countries has also yielded new results, Wang said.
Xi said the two sides will build an all-around cooperation pattern, enhancing their cooperation in four areas of trade and investment, post-earthquake reconstruction, energy and tourism, according to Wang.
China has pledged to continue supporting Nepal in the country’s post-earthquake reconstruction, and provide support and assistance for the improvement of local people’s livelihood, Wang said, adding that the two sides have also agreed to expand exchanges and cooperation in such fields as education and youth, and at local levels.
Maintaining regional peace, stability
Wang said the recent strained India-Pakistan relations and unrest in the region have drawn grave concerns from the international community.
He said both India and Pakistan are friendly neighbors of China, and the Chinese side hopes that the two countries can properly manage and control differences and improve their ties.
Prior to Xi’s trip to South Asia, the Chinese president listened to the views and propositions of the Pakistani side in his meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan.
In Chennai, Xi said all sides should work together to promote regional peace and stability, and achieve common development and prosperity.
Wang said China is willing to develop and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation with all South Asian countries, adding that China’s respective relations with India, Pakistan and other South Asian countries could run in parallel and develop together, neither targeting any third party nor being influenced by a third party.
During Xi’s visit, leaders of India and Nepal once again extended warm congratulations to Xi on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, expressing their admiration for the remarkable achievements China has made in the past seven decades.
Leaders of both countries said China’s development sets an example of self-reliance for developing countries, and creates significant opportunities for the two countries, South Asia and the world to achieve peace and prosperity, adding that China’s development is unstoppable.

Independent judiciary plays an important role in democratic dispensation. The Constitution has also accepted this reality. Part 11 of the Constitution provides for judiciary. Separation of powers ensures that there would be no pressure and influence on justice delivery.
The Supreme Court of Nepal has formed a four-member committee under the coordination of Justice Hari Krishna Karki on 23 May to study avenues to keep I/NGOs away from judiciary. The Committee is expected to submit a report incorporating suggestions within 20 July.
RoLHR programme conducted by foreign organisations through United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) ended in December 2017. It had been providing aid for training, study visits and protection of human rights. But service seekers and advocates of clean judiciary have been feeling that donors exert undue influence on judiciary. Therefore raising of voices was mandatory. The reactions expressed during lawyers’ conference in Nepalgunj need to be appreciated in this context.
UNDP is a UN agency but it does not have independent financial resources. It collects resources from different countries to carry out different projects in Nepal. While implementing these projects, donors have been forcing to execute activities that go contrary to Nepal’s religious and social values and norms. There are also instances of donors unnecessarily inciting Tibetan issues to muddy Nepal’s relationship with China.
Multiple stories in the press have shown that agents of foreign organisations have been alluring top officials of the highest level of judiciary with special allowances and foreign junkets in order of influence them to prepare laws that reflect controversial norms and values, policies and licentiousness in the western world. Sadly, human rights activists and women right activists have gone with this flow. Its consequences will ultimately not be beneficial.
Government officers and consultants should immediately put a brake on activities that are oriented towards donors’ interests rather than Nepal’s social circumstances and foreign policy. Failing to do that, they should be subjected to punishment for working against the country. The currently formed committee in the Supreme Court needs to submit a report recommending immediate halt to foreign aid that impacts the judiciary. Frankly speaking, there was no need to form a committee for this purpose. The conclusion is clear. Absolutely no foreign aid should be taken in direct agreement with foreign agency if we are to keep people’s faith and belief in the judiciary. It is inappropriate to forward donors’ proposals without coordinating with Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The annual budget of the government should manage all resources needed for the functioning of judiciary including the Supreme Court. There should be a provision of increment in budget allocation in consideration of price inflation. It is mandatory to end the situation in which justices have to beg for necessary budget for the judiciary. Otherwise, the executive will have negative impact on judiciary.
Any aid in cash and kind offered by donor countries and foreign organisations need to arrive through government channels. A strong policy of depositing such aid money in a consolidated fund and spending it on the basis of priorities set by the government needs to be implemented. It would be harmful for the country to chase after priorities set by the donors.

21,21,http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/change-in-government/,"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has shown maturity in resigning from his post at the end of his address to the parliament after facing the no-confidence motion. He deserves accolades for taking the uncomplicated path in murky national politics. It was obvious that had the no-trust motion been taken to voting process, political polarization would have increased at unwanted level.
After main coalition partner NCP (Maoist Centre) withdrew support to KP Oli-led government, the coalition government came into precarious position. Oli had two other alternatives apart from resignation: taking vote of confidence from the House or face the no-trust motion. Initially, Oli opted for the third alternative. But he did not let the process reach voting process and submitted his resignation to President Bidya Devi Bhandari before votes could be cast against him. Later, Speaker Onsari Gharti read out the letter received from the Office of the President in the parliament and brought this episode to an end. Had Oli taken the voting route, he had to be removed from his post and it would have been morally difficult for him to remain in the leadership of his party after being gracelessly removed in such manner.
While responding to the motion, Oli logically recounted the achievements during his tenure of nine months. Initial challenges in implementation of constitution, protests by Terai-based parties and impacts of India’s blockade on Nepal became the subjects of his address. Even the opposition parties have not taken exception to Oli’s achievements in inking trade and transportation agreement with China during his state visit to that country. But Nepal has to wait for a while to take advantage of the alternative route because it takes time to prepare physical infrastructure like roads in difficult geographical regions. Whatever the case, his efforts have created base for lessening excessive dependence on India.
The constitution that courted controversy at the very beginning has become more complex after Oli’s resignation. Hurry made in promulgating a piece of document at any cost has created different types of lacunae and lack of clarity. Series of amendments immediately after promulgation of the constitution have made it clear that those holding fate of 28 million Nepalis lack a long-term vision. After Oli’s resignation, some lawyers and constitution experts gave ridiculous arguments that there is no provision for choosing another prime minister in the constitution. This spurious suggestion seems to have befuddled Oli himself and he talked about it in his response. Some other experts were talking about taking this issue to the court. But political issues like these should be resolved through mutual dialogues and healthy competition. They should not be taken to court. Worryingly, promulgators of constitution deliberately provided a space for controversy.
Replacing a communist government with another communist party will satiate the power-hungry lot. Expecting more is meaningless.

22,22,http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/foreign-relations-jeopardy/,"The fate of 21 people selected as Nepal’s ambassadors to different countries three months ago has become uncertain now as the government that recommended their names is to face no-confidence motion. It is clear that the new government replacing Oli will not send those same names to the parliamentary hearing process. Especially, people recommended as envoys due to their loyalty to individual parties are in risk of not getting the post. The move to establish party loyalists to plum posts, disregarding educational qualifications and experiences, had invited derisions.
Only the experienced government officers who have passed public service examinations and taken different training can operate foreign missions and bilateral ties effectively. Representatives to the United Nations bear the responsibility of resolving multilateral diplomatic challenges.
Politically appointed ambassadors are there in the missions to add value only. But that too demands skills, ability and commitment. All these qualities are hardly found in average political activists. That is why political leaders in the new government have to use their discretion in selecting Nepal’s envoy to foreign states.
Diplomatic experts say that vacancy of the post of ambassador in friendly states means that Nepal does not want to have relations with these countries. Can Nepal fulfill its international duties with such a policy of indifference? Should not Nepal government remain alert to keep sensitive relationship with China and India in balance, given our geographical location?
We have been hearing from our leaders that the country is in transition and crisis. But they do not seem to have realized that foreign ties should be given due importance to take the country of out of such situation. If the embassies that spend millions for maintenance each year remain ineffective, what is their necessity in the first place? The government cannot afford any delay in providing due solution to this problem.

23,23,http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/face-the-parliament/,"The country has been pushed to a new phase of stability after CPN (Maoist Centre), main party in the coalition government under Prime Minister KP Oli, decided to withdraw support to the government. Maoist Centre (MC) and Nepali Congress (NC), along with other parties, had expected PM Oli to resign from his post immediately after submitting the formal information of withdrawal of support. But Oli has made public his determination that he would not meekly resign but face the parliament and leave the government through proper process. The PM who was elected through parliamentary voting process can quit the post through legal means and this is the best bet. It is but appropriate that Oli wants to respond to points in the no-confidence motion and desires to put challenges he faced during his tenure in record books.
On Speaker Onsari Gharti’s directions Parliament Secretariat has fixed the date from 21 to 23 July to discuss on no-confidence motion against Oli government. Meanwhile, a way out can be found before that date if political parties make a new agreement or a new coalition following mutual consultations. If that fails to happen, the voting after discussion in the House can pass or reject the motion. But in closely following the latest developments it appears that Maoist and its new partner NC will be able to pass the motion and Oli government can be unseated. However, nothing can be claimed with certainty as yet.
MC and NC have agreed that after the ousting of Oli-led government the next government will be under the leadership of Prachanda. Government made with this process is said to make way for another government after nine months. If everything goes according to the plan, all three elections: local, provincial and general, will be conducted before January 2018 as stipulated in the constitution. A new phase of stability will start from there.
But circumstances are not rosy. Fundamentally constitution has been a controversial document. Promulgated in a hurry, the statute could not address certain sensitive issues. Those outside the Constituent Assembly elections and those dissatisfied with the constitution are still expressing their grievances. Leaders of top parties were focused on constitution promulgation at any cost and they realized the need for quick amendment to it. Further amendment is still being floated. In other words, leaders with mandate to prepare supreme law of the land showed lack of far-sightedness.
Giving a constitution with provisions that would be irrelevant within weeks or months of promulgation is blatantly deceiving the public. People are right to raise questions about lack of a credible basis for political stability even after 10 years of movement for restoration of democracy. Leaders have to shoulder the blame for failing to institutionalize alleged achievements of the movement.
No-trust motion is the immediate challenge. Adopting democratic norms means that this motion should be handled through discussion and voting in the parliament. After all, it is the universally accepted measure to establish political legality. This is why probably PM and CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli adopted the political strategy to go through the process.
Despite this, some ‘experts’ of constitutional law have shown ambiguities in law to suggest the PM that his minority government can remain in power on the basis of these loopholes. This legal nitty-gritty is not the proper solution to current political complexity. Consultants should not provide wrong suggestions that serve vested interests. The PM should rebuff such suggestions.

24,24,http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/find-middle-path/,"An uneasy situation has developed as Dr. Govinda KC who has been tirelessly fighting for cleansing medical education and health services organised a press meet on 26 June and accused Chief Commissioner of Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Lokman Singh Karki of overreaching his jurisdiction. KC has announced to sit in a fast-unto-death from 10 July to pressure the parliament for impeaching Karki.
KC has accused Karki of interfering in medical entrance examination of Kathmandu University and Karki has refuted this claim through CIAA spokesperson. While raising objection to KC’s expression, CIAA spokesperson commented that KC was guided with ill mentality. The commission has advised KC not to be a sponsored campaigner. It believes that KC is being mobilised by a group of people with vested interests. KC has not countered any of these claims.
Due to KC’s silence in this matter, people supporting him are in a fix. They are divided whether to back KC’s campaign or not. Meanwhile, Kathmandu University has informed that the said medical entrance examination was fairly conducted. University Dean Bhola Thapa told the media that after getting information of leaked questions CIAA team sprung into action and a group of experts prepared another set of questions in CIAA’s presence and the exams were conducted. Dean Thapa has clarified that there are no irregularities.
But Thapa’s statement should have been effective before Senate-member of that University Kedarbhakta Mathema’s resignation from his post on Tuesday. Likewise, it would have been better if six ex-vice chancellors including Mathema (who is ex-vice chancellor of Tribhuvan University as well) urged for parliamentary inquiry.
Good governance and Monitoring Committee of the parliament has pulled up Chief Commissioner Karki and Dr. KC to question about their ‘irresponsible reactions’. This matter has been handed over to the sub-committee.
It is not a good indication that a constitutional body and its chief is subject to such controversy. At a time when news about abuses of authority and corruption have been making headlines, a constitutional body responsible for monitoring and controlling such irregularities is in a defensive position. This development has disappointed people. Only those involved in accumulating illegal money through abuse of authority must have been elated with this development. Country and society may have to pay a huge price for this.
Dr Govinda KC has appealed to impeach Chief Commissioner Karki and other commissioners complicit with him. Constitution’s Article 238 has provided for impeachment. Anyone practicing freedom of expression as provided by the constitution can raise the issue of impeachment. But procedure stipulated in Article 101 makes it clear that impeachment motion can be passed in the parliament only by two-thirds majority. There is nothing to prove that Karki has seriously violated constitution and law and there is no ground for impeaching him. Such a practice has not taken place in Nepal as yet. Even in other democratic countries, this is rarely done. Dr KC’s hunger strike threat cannot convince two-third members of the parliament to proceed with impeachment motion.
Despite all this, Dr. KC is a person who has done selfless service to the country and led by example. He has been constantly raising voices against fake doctors playing with people’s lives. His campaign of discouraging the trend of profit-oriented health service has its heart in the right place. But KC should be alert about violation of people’s right to fundamental health services if he sits in hunger strike in hospital premises. Health practitioners and service seekers should not fear the potential of a dire situation created by the hunger strike.
We understand that purpose of both parties to the current dispute is maintaining quality in medical education and health service. For this, an environment of mutual agreement is required. Both sides should be flexible and opt for a middle way and work to free health sector of irregularities.
As an important constitutional body, CIAA should hold discussion with Dr. KC and try to address his complaints and interests. Meanwhile Dr. KC too should drop his rigid stance and show eagerness to sit in discussion process. Rigidity will not benefit anyone.

25,25,http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/bring-land-plotters-justice/,"Locals at Taukhel, Lalitpur, were in shock last Friday when the wall of Pushpanjali Secondary School collapsed, killing two students and leaving many others injured. The wall abutting the school building caved in and buried two students in the classroom. Condolences and sympathies to families of the dead and injured have been pouring in from Nepal and abroad.
Education Minister Girirajmani Pokahrel immediately took interest in Taukhel incident. Lalitpur Chief District Officer Rishiram Sharma said that the land plotters who erected wall unsafely near the school despite opposition will be brought to justice. This commitment must have consoled the locals. Since this incident is related to taking of children’s lives by sheer negligence, those involved in it should be tried at the court with murder case and punished to the extent of law. Political parties and their sister organisations should not pressure anyone to commute the punishment for the accused. If there is any pressure from anyone, authorities should make them public so that such move will be resisted.
Everyone knows that land plotting is not limited to Lalitpur. Arable lands in other places have been plotted for residential purposes. Long-term solution to this problem lies in building a clear national policy of land use that determines residential area, industrial area, and arable land area. Not doing this immediately will put innocent lives in peril.

26,26,http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/mending-ties/,"If two latest publications from Indian foreign ministry are anything to go by, Indian government is eager to repair broken relationship with Nepal. One of the publications contains Indian Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s remarks that Nepal-India ties are as ancient as the Himalayas and Ganges. Right from the time of his ascent to the seat of power, Modi has adopted the policy of ‘neighbourhood first’.  And he came to Nepal within weeks of swearing-in. None of the Indian PMs had come to Nepal on a state visit for 17 years. Modi himself was uncomfortable with such a long gap in visiting a country that shares close social-cultural ties with India. Modi came to Nepal during SAARC summit as well.
But things turned worse all of a sudden and Nepal had to face economic blockade despite New Delhi’s claim that it had no enmity against Nepal. Nepalis had to face extreme difficulties as imports of even essential goods halted. Five months after the promulgation of constitution, Nepalis had to undergo harsh conditions due to the blockade. Nepal’s new constitution, a domestic matter, was the cause behind India’s unfriendly stance towards Nepal. Constitution promulgated in a hurry had been generating many discussions and controversies but that was Nepal’s internal challenge. Dissatisfaction against the statute was not limited to Tarai-Madhes. But New Delhi chose to ignore Nepal’s ground reality and India overstepped in internationalising Nepal’s internal affairs.
But it is history now. Famous publications mentioned above seem to have clarified that New Delhi has corrected its views on Nepal. It now takes Nepal’s new constitution as relevant in developing constitutional democratic process. Having accepted that issues to be resolved are Nepal’s internal matters, India has hoped that they will meet a logical conclusion soon. Thus, these new developments are positive. Only it needs to be seen how quickly and how heartily does this new thought get implemented. Efforts in normalising relationship will depend on it.
For now, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs needs to take this change of heart shown by New Delhi as an effort towards building favourable environment in bilateral ties. Future meetings of bilateral mechanisms will be guided by New Delhi’s stance in the meeting of ministerial level Nepal-India Joint Commission that is expected to start within few weeks. Conclusions of discussions among eminent persons from each country will provide initial hints towards this direction.

27,27,http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/merchants-of-death/,"Legal provisions make it mandatory that eligible people obtain driving licenses after completing necessary examinations and processes. Drivers with licenses acquired by normal process drive their vehicles with caution and are not usually involved in accidents. Especially, private vehicle owners are averse to any additional risk.
But data shows that road accidents in Nepal have been increasing over the years. Police Headquarters data shows that each year around 2,000 people die in road accidents. Many others are maimed and disabled in road rage. This is a worrying scenario.
It is state’s primary obligation to protect citizens’ life and it has to manage roads properly for minimum loss of life and property. Driving vehicles with bad engines, drivers’ negligence and unrepaired roads are some causes of accidents that can be easily prevented. That is why government bodies need to be responsible in preventing such accidents. Coordination among road department, transportation management department and traffic police will lessen road accidents. This coordination appears to be lacking.
Adding a horrible dimension to this worrying situation, fake driving license scam has come to public notice. The story on fake driving licenses carried out by Lokaantar yesterday exposes that 40,000 vehicles of all types have been plying Kathmandu roads with fake licenses. Gangs of fake license sellers are active. Chiefs of transportation offices and traffic police say that these gangs deliver fake licenses to the seekers’ doorsteps with a fee of minimum 10,000 rupees. Transportation and traffic police officers have indirectly corroborated the existence of illegal business of fake licenses.
This deadly business of fake driving licenses being allowed to run is beyond ordinary imagination. Continuation of such criminal activity under the watch of an elected government is a matter of worry. News report claims that many holders of fake licenses have gone abroad. Such fake licenses are in risk of cancellation by foreign governments and this will tarnish Nepal’s image. Just like European embargo on Nepal’ aeroplanes, this fake license scam will further isolate Nepal in international stage.
But it is unfortunate that the government has failed to take concrete steps at a time when circumstances have turned worse. That is why the government that appears to be alert about people’s comfort, have to give priority to safety of citizens’ life.

28,28,http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/curb-the-taliban/,"The attack on Nepali guards in a minibus in Kabul on 20 June has claimed 13 lives and left many wounded, leaving Nepal in tears. This atrocious incident has proved that the already fragile law and order situation in Afghanistan has further complicated. But Nepalis who had reached Afghanistan through private security companies had nothing to do with that country’s unstable internal politics. They were workers deployed for security of diplomatic agencies and missions from different countries in Kabul. Taliban leaders must have understood this reality and fatally attacked the vehicle carrying Nepalis. Thus this massacre of innocent people has to be condemned with strong words. Afghanistan’s international image has further been tarnished with this violent attack.
Nepalis working in high-risk condition in Afghanistan say that security service companies deploying them as security guards have not taken adequate care about their safety. Guerrilla attacks like the one that killed Nepalis would not have taken place if the guards were put in bulletproof vehicles or escorted by security agents. This aspect of negligence in security management’s part has to be investigated at the government level.
Another point to be made in this context is the assessment of risks to be made by Nepali workers abroad. Workers should be alert about potential risks and challenges in foreign jobs, meaning that they should decide to go for abroad employment only after getting information from office concerned. Safety is utmost priority and workers should be cautious about frauds. Salaries and perks for working in war-zones like Afghanistan and Iraq are attractive but that attraction cannot be more important than one’s life. Nepalis can earn their living in Nepal, provided they stop dreaming of luxurious lives and keep their necessities at the minimum. Opportunities for agriculture works and other means of self-employment are in plenty in the country even if political situation is unstable.
Kabul and other areas in Afghanistan have suffered violent revolts for a long time. The West, especially the US, has spent billions to bring stability and governance in Afghanistan hoping that it would contribute to lessen terrorist activities across the world. The US has provided military assistance to government security agencies in Afghanistan who have been trained by American experts. But still Afghan security mechanism has not been able to provide terror-free environment for Afghanis and migrant workers. Therefore, western powers involved in bringing stability in Afghanistan cannot shirk off their responsibilities before circumstances get better.

29,29,http://english.lokaantar.com/editorial/probe-into-quackery/,"Investigation team of the Nepal Police has arrested some people active in clinics and hospitals as ‘doctors’ without necessary credentials and taken them into judicial custody. Lead investigator Nabaraj Silwal has assured the public that arrest and prosecution of these doctors has been carried out on the basis of proper investigation and evidence. Kathmandu District Court has remanded these 16 ‘doctors’ to custody for five days pending further investigation.
These ‘doctors’ with insufficient academic qualifications had taken license to examine patients, prescribe medicines and do surgeries, thereby played with people’s health. Many patients might have lost their lives at the hands of these doctors with no qualifications and skills. Many others might have become disabled. Thus, it is a serious crime against humanity. It is state’s duty to find out the root cause behind this scam. The court is also expected to look into these issues during trial.
All accused have to be presumed innocent until proved guilty. But Nepal Medical Association’s objection against the police arresting fake doctors is surprising. Association chief Dr. Anjani Kumar Jha, in one radio interview, said that these doctors should not have been arrested; cancellation of their license by Nepal Medical Council (NMC) would have been enough. But is it such a simple issue? Revoking license of a quack is not sufficient punishment just like a driver cannot be let off with mere cancellation of license for killing people in road accident.
But questions should be raised as to why these doctors facing trial were allowed to study at the MBBS level without properly examining their secondary and intermediate level certificates. NMC also could have scrutinised their academic credentials while taking license examinations. It goes without saying that qualified, experienced and renowned doctors are responsible for these exams. High-level officers at Education Ministry and Health Ministry are also involved in it. Does this mean they have failed in fulfilling their responsibilities? Or were they involved in corruption? Answers to these questions need to be searched. Authorities concerned should take initiatives in delving into this issue.

Kathmandu, 15 November (2019) – Inspector General of Police Sarbendra Khanal has made his career as a competent police office ever since he entered the police force as an inspector. But in two years at the helm of the force, his image has tarnished.
Khanal carefully built up his positive image in the police for 28 years but blemished it after becoming the IGP. Top police officers have commented that due to the IGP’s problematic working style, credibility and respect for the police force has taken a hit.
“Laborious police officers did not get due credit. They toiled hard but he took all the credit. As the police chief, it is his responsibility to promote the worthy officers,” one officer expressed his dissatisfaction. “His activities have dented the confidence of the junior officers.”
Khanal is to retire after three months but his tenure towards the end is subject to criticism. Organizational slump and erosion of personal image is difficult to recover in these three months. Some of the cases have dragged police force into controversy under Khanal’s leadership.
Nirmala Pant murder case
Handling the case of the brutal murder of teenager Nirmala Pant in Kanchanpur district in Farwestern Province speaks volumes about IGP Khanal’s failure. Sixteen months have passed since the incident occurred but the culprits are still at large.
Nirmala Pant’s half-naked body was found on July 27, 2018 in a sugarcane field. On August 20, 2018 the police made one Dilip Singh Bista public proclaiming him to be the chief accused.
This case courted huge controversy with accusations that the police had tampered with the evidence at the site of murder. Dilip Singh Bista was said to be tortured in custody to confess to Pant’s murder. But Bista had to be freed after his DNA did not match with the artefacts in the crime scene. Although IGP Khanal boasted that the police force will bring a closure to the incident, it never happened.
Kumar Poudel’s fake encounter
The police killed one Kumar Poudel belonging to Nepal Communist Party (Biplav Outfit) in an encounter in Sarlahi district in eastern Tarai. National Human Rights Commission investigated into the incident and recommended the government to take action against the implicated police officers.
The Commission’s recommendation report clearly mentions that the incident is not an encounter but murder in cold blood and there are errors in post-mortem report from a medico-legal perspective.
The Commission has recommended the government to suspend Inspector Krishna Dev Prasad Sah as well as Police Constables Binod Sah and Satya Nayaran Mishra but they have not been suspended yet. Experts say that Poudel “encounter” has dented IGP Khanal’s image.
CIAA raids Police Headquarters
On September 6, 2019 a special team of the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) raided the Police Headquarters in Naxal and took last two years’ documents in control. Suspecting irregularities, the CIAA has taken away original documents about procurement of uniform, vehicles and other goods.
CIAA taking away the papers from Police Headquarters suspecting corruption is being taken as IGP Khanal’s failure.
Hobnobbing with the powerful
Besides failure in these emblematic cases, IGP Khanal is known for hobnobbing with the powerful people. He is known to cosy up with the political party in power.
His closeness with Nepali Congress party is public knowledge but of late he made connections with Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”.  The Congress party was about to make Rajendra Man Shrestha the DIG but he had to be hospitalized for paralysis. With Shrestha out of the picture, Khanal was the only candidate with the backing of Nepali Congress and he stood first in the promotion to the post of DIG.
Afterwards, he secured Prachanda’s support to become the IGP even if he did not have warm relationship with the then UML.

Kathmandu, 19 April (2019) – Amnesty International Nepal submitted today Amnesty International’s analysis of Nepal’s new law on the right to food and food sovereignty to the Agriculture and Livestock Development Minister Chakra Pani Khanal.
Amnesty International emphasizes that Nepal must strengthen and implement its new law on the right to food in order to meet its commitments to rid the country of hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity.
A delegation consisting of Amnesty Internationl Nepal’s Board Chair Bikram Dhukuchhu and representatives from Community Self Rlinace Center (CSRC) and JuRI Nepal submitted the analysis paper to Minister Khanal at the latter’s office in Singha Durbar today.
Amnesty International’s briefing Analysis of the Right to Food and Food Sovereignty Act recommends for the law to be amended. It suggests that rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of the law need to be crafted sooner.
The briefing  was made public on 4 April 2019 amidst a programme with representatives from Nepal’s civil society, National Human Rights Commission and media.
Background:
Hunger was one of the root causes of Nepal’s decade-long internal conflict, and it continues to be felt across the country today. Nearly half of all households in Nepal face food insecurity, and a tenth are “severely food insecure”. More than a half of all children under five years of age are anaemic, while more than a third of them suffer from stunted growth.
In an important step towards realizing its goal of “zero hunger” by 2025, the Nepal government brought the Right to Food and Food Sovereignty Act 2018 into force last September.

In a bid to embark upon the agenda of civil service reform, which remains a cherished goal of our democracy, the Constitution has established a Public Service Commission at the centre and State Public Service Commission at the provincial level.
The government has recently tabled a bill in the House to determine the basis and standards related to the constitution, work, duty and rights of Provincial Civil Service Commission. Nevertheless, the bill incorporates a plethora of provisions to ensure a huge say of the Centre. This goes against the federal fabrics of our Constitution, say the stakeholders and experts.
As per Section 3 of the Bill, state civil service officers will have to face the written examination, interview, or the other assessments prescribed by the state public service commission. The provision empowers the states to conduct the written test for the recruitment of state police forces.
Section 7 envisages that the candidates appearing for the public service examinations in the provinces shall write papers in the official language of the federal government. Article 7 (1) of the Constitution says that the Nepali language written in Devanagari script shall be the language of official business in Nepal.  On the other hand, Article 7(2) provisions that a province shall select one or more national languages (in addition to Nepali) as the language of official business.
This way, “The bill grossly fails to quicken the pulse of linguistic diversity as well as federal principles. It reflects the unitary mind set of the state,” said Surendra Mahato, a senior advocate at the Supreme Court of Nepal, in an interaction programme organised by Kathmandu University School of Law Dhulikhel on Friday in Kathmandu. He further said that the bill appears to be originated from the centralised mind set of bureaucracy which prefers accumulation of power over the devolution of power.
At this background, it bears relevance to discuss the practice adopted by India. In India, the candidates are allowed to use any one language from the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution or English or the official language of the state as the medium of examination in different public service commission examinations.  The Eighth Schedule of Constitution lists 22 languages that include Nepali, Maithili and Hindi.
“This bill deserves to be modified from the very preamble to the concluding provision as it miserably fails to address the basic federal principles envisaged in our Constitution,” further said Mahato. He was also of the opinion that the provisions in bill offer minimal autonomy to the provinces which would ultimately foil the creativity of the second tier governments. “The provisions demonstrate that the states are merely the implementing agencies of the policies formulated by the Centre.”
Mahato added that a federal state ought to foster diversity “but this bill seeks to nurture uniformity.”
However, Dr Bharat Raj Gautam, main speaker in the programme, was of the view that the provision relating to language in bill is in furtherance of the Constitution and the principles and standards laid-down by the Public Service Commission (PSC). “The candidates appearing the examinations of the State Public Service Commission (SPSC) ought to write papers in Nepali or English. This provision would maintain uniformity and advance the standards and norms of the PSC,” said he. He claimed that the bill establishes sufficient nexus with the federal principles enshrined under the 2015 Constitution.
Gautam further said that the bill ought to have ensured the representation of women in composition of State Public Service Commission envisaged under Section 3. “Initially, this bill should be taken as an instrument supporting the ‘standards and principles’ of the PSC,” said Gautam.
But, “The bill does not shed light on those ‘standards and principles’ of the PSC,” said Mahato, adding, “This bill is not in the line with the constitutional spirits.”
Seconding the view of Mahato, Mangal Bahadur Menyangbo, an advocate, said that the bill seeks to confer power on limited hands which neither supports the federal principles nor address the concerns of marginalised communities. “It reflects the unitary mind set of the state.”
Likewise, Ang Dawa Sherpa, a former lawmaker, said that the bill lacks provisions to supplement the federal fabrics of the Republic. “The bill ought to have addressed the linguistic and cultural diversity and conferred power on the SPSC to discharge functions without consulting the PSC,” said she.
At this backdrop, Dr Surya Dhungel, a senior advocate and an eminent expert of Constitutional Law, said that it’s high time to understand that the grant of provincial autonomy does not necessarily enable the centrifugal forces to take root. “Those who oppose federalism by advocating a strong centre have never understood the beauty of the devolution power,” added he.
Section 9 of bill prescribes that the SPSC will consult the PSC while drafting the policies relating to the public services. The SPSC is also required to take the PSC into confidence while initiating departmental inquiries or promotions of the staffs in service.
Also, the bill says that the PSC shall always be consulted while formulating the policies regarding the appointment and promotion of police staffs in state. This way, the states are offered minimal say which secures a federation with strong centralising tendencies.
However, in India, a SPSC discharges all those functions in respect of the State Services as does the Union Commission in relation to the Union Services.
The speakers in the programmes stressed on the need of maintaining diversity than uniformity in the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. “The centralised decision-making tendencies in a federation can tarnish the federal republican character of the state by suppressing the local concerns and introducing inadequacies which are not favourable to our federalism,” said Lal Babu Yadav, a former Constituent Assembly member.

There was a time, known as the laissez faire era, when the state was chiefly concerned with the maintenance of law and order and defence of the country against external aggression, war or armed conflict. Such a restrictive concept of the state no longer exists.
The architects of the Constitution of Nepal realised that political democracy would be useless in absence of economic democracy. It is heartening that Nepal has adopted a plethora of economic, social and cultural rights as fundamental rights with a view to uplift socio-economic condition of the national population.
Unlike the United States, Nepal has already ratified International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). “The economic, social and cultural rights could be characterised as basics to our social order as they intend to build a just society. These rights play an instrumental role in achieving socio-economic revolution to end poverty, ignorance, disease and inequality of opportunity,” said Hari Phuyal, former Attorney General and a senior advocate at Supreme Court, in an interaction programme jointly organized by Law and Policy Forum for Social Justice (LAPSOJ) and iProbono on Tuesday in Kathmandu.
He further said that the horizons of the fundamental rights would shrink in absence of economic, social and cultural rights.
Barun Ghimire, iProbono Nepal Legal Analyst, said that the judiciary is also a part of welfare state in Nepal. “The Supreme Court of Nepal has decided on number of occasions to promote social welfare policies. There are ample rights which were part of directive principles in yesteryears but now they have been introduced under fundamental rights by virtue of robust judicial activism and judicial creativity,” he said.
“It’s advisable for the judicial department to champion the cause of public welfare by interpreting the economic, social and cultural rights in the light of civil and political rights and other human rights. Such an attempt would not only maintain rule of law but also foster constitutionalism,” further said Ghimire, who also teaches Law at Chakrabati College of Law, Kathmandu.
Anurag Devkota, Programme Coordinator at LAPSOJ, argued that the scope of fundamental rights would be further widened at times when the state and judicial department both starts believing that there is no anti-thesis between civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights.
He further said that it’s imperative for the government to uphold economic, social and cultural rights in order to widen the scope of human rights and avoid the violation of international obligations.
While explaining the provisions of Consumer Protection Act, 2018, Alok Pokharel, a lecturer of Constitutional Law, said, “Section 6 (5) prescribes that labelling is not required for goods that are sold openly such as fruits, vegetable. However, its proviso requires that there should be labelling in fruits and vegetable imported to Nepal. This is something difficult to be regulated considering Nepal’s open and often unregulated border with India.”
He further said that there are regular instances, when traders and individuals bring in materials including fruits and vegetable informally escaping custom and trade regulations. “In addition, fruits and vegetable brought from Taplejung and Bajura, among remotest districts of Nepal, to major cities like Kathmandu, Biratnagar and Dhangadhi can be exempted from labelling, but the same brought from nearby cities like Raxaul, Jogbani and Gauriphanta of India, which are even closer than Taplejung and Bajura to such major cities should have labels.”
Pokharel added that Section 6 of the Act requires that labelling in goods shall be done in English and Nepali languages but it ignores the majority population of Nepal who have local dialects and who do not speak or understand English and Nepali languages. Also, “Section 11 has the provision on obligation of seller/vendor, but the Act does not define who the sellers/vendors are. It is very likely that street sellers/vendors are exempted from the obligations of the Act unless otherwise specified.”
Likewise, Mariam Faruqi, director of iProbono’s South Asia regional projects based in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh, said that the object of their intervention is to empower Nepali lawyers to develop tools to promote and protect economic, social and cultural rights. “Capacity building of young lawyers is also on the agenda. We would also like to work on the next project and consider regional approach to enhancing litigation relating to core rights,” she said.
Kalyan Pokharel, executive member at the Supreme Court Bar Association, was of the opinion that Right to food and food sovereignty Act, 2018 is a welcome legislation which aims to foster the cause of socio-economic democracy. “This Act encourages the central, provincial and local bodies to take (joint) initiatives in limiting the complexities coming in the way of food sovereignty. If we don’t have sufficient food productivity, then we will have to face scores of socio-economic problems.  Ultimately, we would fail to ensure food sovereignty. This legislation seeks to ensure food sovereignty.”
Jivesh Jha, a guest faculty at Kathmandu University School of Law Dhulikhel, said that Right to free and compulsory education Act, 2018 lacks provisions to control the monopoly of private school mafias. “In this way, Nepal’s Act falls short of adopting any measures to regulate the private school fees. So, balancing the independence of private institutions and public welfare functions has become a controversial issue.”
The speakers in the program stressed on the need of carrying out human rights agendas actively for the development of the country.

Nepal’s Supreme Court has ordered the government not to construct any new roads inside Chitwan National Park without approval from UNESCO, park authorities and other stakeholders.
Chitwan National Park is home the world’s second-largest population of greater one-horned rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis) as well as a significant population of Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris), 54 other mammal species and more than 550 varieties of birds. Chitwan’s extraordinary biodiversity led to its inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984.
However, plans to construct road and rail links passing through the park alarmed conservationists, and in 2017 landed Nepal with a formal warning from UNESCO that moving forward with the proposed projects could put Chitwan on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
Following the UNESCO warning, plans to develop the proposed East-West Electric Railway and Terai-Hulaki Highway were put on hold. The court’s verdict, issued following a Feb. 13 hearing, means that the government now has no choice but to accept the terms UNESCO puts forward for these projects.
According to the details of the court order, released Feb. 14, the judges held that building a road through the park without UNESCO approval would violate international treaties and agreements to which Nepal is party. The court said the planned projects can be built only after their environmental impact assessments are approved by Chitwan National Park, UNESCO and other stakeholders.
The court also noted that its attention had been drawn to another warning issued by UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee in October 2018, via a letter not made publicly available, detailing the committee’s requirements for an environmental impact assessment.
The verdict came in response to a petition originally filed in 2012 by lawyer Ramchandra Simkhada, who had requested a court order to halt the construction of the 30-kilometer (19-mile) East-West Highway because it would pass through the habitat of endangered animals and plants.

In resource-constrained country like Nepal, where the state actors face challenges in addressing socio-economic problems faced by the national population, the role of civil society organizations becomes crucial in promoting the grassroots-level participation for sensitizing the democratic process.
However, the presence of stringent laws to regulate and monitor or dictate the business of non-government sectors could create hurdles in responding the growing needs of the population at marginalized sections or grassroots level.
In this light, legal professionals, academicians, researchers and other stakeholders have raised their serious concerns over the draft of Social Organizations Act recently submitted by Nepal Law Commission to the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. The speakers said that the government was planning to regulate, dictate and control the avenues of the non-government organizations (NGOs) under restrictive laws.
“This is a very important bill which needs to be discussed among the civil society stakeholders, including NGOs and other organizations, be it ‘Aama Samuh’ [mother’s group] or similar groups engaged with agriculture sector, working at the grassroots.  The basic problem with the bill is that it seeks to focus on the control and supervision than on how to promote the civic space for creative and constructive use,” said Dr Bipin Adhikari, Dean, Kathmandu University School of Law, Dhulikhel.
He further said that the bill is home to very strange provisions. “There are certain provisions which empower the state to prosecute the civil society groups under espionage laws and try the NGOs for criminal offences, including breach of peace. It’s not pragmatic to incorporate criminal liabilities in this bill as we have a fair corpus of laws to deal with criminal offences or the situations influencing the national security,” argued Dr Adhikari while addressing the interaction program organized by Kathmandu University School of Law, Dhulikhel on Tuesday.
“We must strike optimum balance when deciding what and how to regulate. The laws should create conducive atmosphere, not restrictive ones, for the government and NGOs to operate in close cooperation in a bid to reap better outcomes,” added he.
The bill contains provisions to regulate corruption as well. “Corruption is an issue for the state as it involves misuse or abuse of public power. NGOs may be engaged in mismanagement of resources and they could be prosecuted for the same but not necessarily in abuse of state’s power. So, it’s unjust to put NGOs and government sectors on the same footing and charge them for corruption. Importantly, we have laws to deal with mismanagement of property or resources,” he added.
Similarly, anti-corruption crusader Kedar Khadka said, “This bill is in want of modifications. There are ample provisions which are unreasonable and restrictive in nature. If this bill takes the shape of law, it would frustrate the genuine voices of the civic societies in one or some other way.” He further said that the government (under the garb of law) wants to control rather than facilitate the civil societies.
Another speaker Kiran Kumari Gupta, a Supreme Court advocate, was of the opinion that the bill seeks to over-regulate the business of NGOs. “The NGOs could be engaged at planning and implementation level, which is still lacking for which the government carries greater responsibility. The current bill would certainly frustrate the working style of the two sectors [i.e., government and NGOs] that ought to be reconciled for the greater benefits of the populace,” further said she.
Pabitra Raut, faculty of Law at Nepal Law Campus, Kathmandu, opined that it’s contradictory in itself to give space to right-based organizations or development partners and endorse stringent controlling mechanism both at the same time. “The current bill acknowledges a good deal of provisions to stifle the genuine concerns of civil societies. It’s more or less conferring arbitrary powers on the government to regulate the non-governmental sectors,” added she.
Likewise, Dr Surya Dhungel, an eminent expert of Constitutional Law, said, “A clause seeks to regulate the networks of Nepal’s NGOs spread outside the country. How is it feasible? How practical is it for the Nepal’s NGOs to operate its business in the line with the legal ambits of other countries?”
He said that the government was planning to suppress the concern of right-based civil societies by invoking derogatory laws. “These types of laws would not provide enabling environment for the NGOs.”
The speakers in the programme, which saw the presence of stakeholders and advocates, argued that the bill is couched in a language which requires the civil societies to dance at the tune of the government of the day. They stressed on the need of amending restrictive provisions for the cause of liberal democracy.

Kathmandu, 1 January (2019) – The Supreme Court of Nepal on Monday has issued a directive order in the name of Office of Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) and other ministries concerned regarding the effective implementation of Free Visa Free Ticket policy announced by the Government of Nepal in June 2015.
On 25 August 2018, Law and Policy Forum for Social Justice (LAPSOJ) and Asian Human Rights and Culture Development Forum jointly registered a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) demanding an order to enact and implement effective law to ensure effective implementation of the Free Visa Free Ticket policy of the government.
The petition further demanded to incorporate the punitive, preventive and compensation related provisions and procedures followed with strict monitoring mechanism in the prospective law.
A single bench of Justice Purushottam Bhandari on August 30, 2017 (Bhadra 14, 2074) had issued a show cause order in the name of the respondents asking them to submit a written response regarding the same.
After the final hearing on Monday, the division bench of Justice Purushottam Bhandari and Justice Kedar Prasad Chalise issued a directive order in the name of the Government of Nepal to take necessary steps in order to implement the ‘Free Visa Free Ticket’ policy announced by the government in 2015, and to enact necessary laws.
A team of lawyers including former Attorney General Hari Phuyal, Advocate Ramesh Badal, Barun Ghimire and Advocate Anurag Devkota argued before the Supreme Court in the final hearing.

National Planning Commission (NPC) has faced battery of questions on its relevance after the progress of the national pride projects was slow off the mark. During the 43rd meeting of the national development problems solution committee, the Prime Minister and Ministers questioned the NPC’s role and relevance after hearing the miserable progress of the development projects in the country.
“What’s the meaning of NPC which has failed to suggest plan, make amendments, point out weakness, and show methods of solution,” PM KP Sharma Oli wondered in the meeting. He vented the ire that it was not good to have NPC’s suggestion as if these are the mantras chanted by traditional shaman.
To the NPC, which has been contributing to country’s policy making and budgeting for six decades, the PM added the huge reform was needed in it
Similarly, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health and Population, Upendra Yadav, said as per the NPC there was 50 percent progress in the last 30 years in the national pride project. In more than a decade, the construction of postal highway made 25 percent success. “At such situation, what’s the relevance of NPC? I can debate for hours on it, we are backtracking,” he argued, why and where we failed to set development priority.
Unless health and education are improved, prosperity is not possible, according to him.
Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supplies Matrika Prasad Yadav said the slogan, ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ could not be feasible from the present ‘wrong’ working style regarding project selection.
The NPC team led by its vice-chairman Dr Pushpa Raj Kandel, is preparing to formulate the 15th National Plan and reviewing the 14th five-year plan.
Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Bhanubhakta Dhakal said he was surprised by the report presented that there was no problem in the government ministries directly concerned with the public in the context of public complaint of lack of good governance in the country linking with corruption and bureaucratic red tape.
Education and Technology Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel stressed on the need of clear work plan to mobilize resources and human resources.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Pradip Gyawali said there is the need of constructive intervention and a project bank to remove the problems resulting from lack of inter-ministry coordination in connection to taking forward the infrastructure development projects.
Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Management, Raghuveer Mahaseth warned that his ministry would start carrying out works in its own way if it did not get the response from NPC on time regarding its requests to address the problems seen in course of project implementation.
Labour and Employment Minister Gokarna Bista underlined the need of identifying the problem and locating it in the construction of development infrastructures in order to address it. He also stressed on inter-ministry level coordination in the design and implementation of development projects.
The meeting highlighted selection of development projects on the basis of their appropriateness and not on the influence of some leaders or access to power in the backdrop of the most of the projects not meeting the target. RSS

Bardibas, 12 Aug (2018) – “Sir, you know, I’m split! I’m a dead man.” It is what a 59-year old-man from Khopi Bairiya of Aurahi Municipality-6 from Mahottari district is found repeating before the group of people and offices seeking justice.
It sounds unbelievable. But, yes, he is the one- Ramsewak Raya Yadav bearing the ‘certificate of his death’ and running from pillar to posts- from the relatives’ homes to government offices and political party leaders. He even nags the unknown persons with his plight.
Ramsewak shared with media persons, “I met everyone- chief district officer, people’s representatives and political leaders and police persons. I’m tired of telling them this story. But, none helped me correct the fake certificate that mentions my death. However, I don’t quit my struggle for justice.”
After the death of mother at teenage, he left home for the job in Punjab, India, leaving behind wife in 1991. As he did not return home for long, the wife too ditched him, getting married to another fellow.
Taking advantage of this tragedy, his step mother and step brother pressed his father Rambrikshya to register for his (Ramwewak) death certificate in May 2011- twenty years after his departure from home. The death certificate was a solid document for the step mother Sakunti Devi and step brother Ram Pukar to immediately transfer his property under their ownership.
As per the registration, his death was occurred in October 2010.

The registration employee or the then VDC secretary Gopal Pathak has signed on Ramsewak’s death certificate.
To this injustice, neighbour Ram Prasad Raya also said it was revealed now that his step mother and step brother exerted pressure on his father to make such document. When he came to home a year back, he was completely a strange to the family.
His mother Kaushilya Devi had registered 15 kattha of land under his name. As this land now amounts tens of thousands rupees, the stepfamily hoodwinked him.
Poor Ramwewak adds, “My father died and the step mother and step brother said they did not know me.” He wipes out the runnel of tears from his cheek and laments, “Homeless, I’m taking shelter at a temple, and eating by begging in the village.”
When Chief District Officer Umesh Kumar Dhakal was asked about this problem, he replied, “Those registering for the death certificate of anyone living is punished as per the law. Because the Local Development Officer is currently out of office for some special reason, this problem will be addressed by investigating the documents.”
The legal practitioners here also said even a legal case could be filed against those involving in making such fake document and return the share of the property to the right owner. Initially, the office preparing the certificate can itself revoke the fake documentation, added advocate Uddhav Chhetri. RSS

Kathmandu, 21 March (2018) – The Supreme Court of Nepal on Wednesday issued a directive order in the name of Office of Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) and other ministries concerned including Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Election Commission regarding the External Voting Rights of Nepalese Migrant Workers.
The Public Interest Litigation was filed before the Supreme Court demanding legal mechanism to ensure the “External voting or out of country voting” apparatuses to ensure the voting rights of Nepali migrant workers abroad. The application sought that the underlining right of ‘opportunity to vote’ of migrant workers as an inherent right falling within the ambit of right to vote and freedom of expression hence, creating an opportunity to take part in election through out of country mechanisms.
The bench of Justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Purushottam Bhandari issued the directive order.
Law and Policy Forum for Social Justice (LAPSOJ) filed the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) at the apex court on 27 April 2017. Considering the significance of the case, the show cause notice on the case was issued by the court on 4 May 2017 and the case was placed under priority hearing.
Today during the main hearing Advocates Hari Phuyal, Barun Ghimire, Anurag Devkota, Alok Pokharel and Kedar Dahal argued before the Supreme Court on behalf of the applicant organization.
Over 4 million Nepali voters are said to be living in 110 different countries. The exponential rise in foreign labour migration has produced a snowball effect on the economy of the nation. However, the government has largely failed to follow up on the implementation of its own laws and policies.
Thus, the most important decision on migrants’ welfare has also been the most discarded. The directive order issued by the Supreme Court of Nepal would serve as a well-timed opportunity for the Nepalese workers abroad to take part in the Public affairs of their country and choose their representatives who will voice and vouch for their rights and access to justice in the future discourse.

The Amazon rainforest covers over half of the planet’s remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most bio-diverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species. Amazon wildfire is a global crisis threatening billions of trees and ecological diversity. It is high time conserve it. It is obvious that the surrounding areas suffer the most but ultimately no one will remain unaffected. It would be difficult to keep a balance of global temperatures without the world’s largest rainforest.
The Brazilian rainforest is caught in the middle between biodiversity and business for a long time now. Despite efforts to conserve while limiting the impacts of climate change, there has been evidence of worsened deforestation, drought lately causing an imbalance in the region. The New York Times reports, in June alone, when the cooler, drier season began and cutting trees became easier, the deforestation rate rose drastically, with roughly 80 percent more forest cover lost than in June of the previous year. The National Institute for Space Research (INPE) monitoring system registered destruction of 4,699 square kilometres this year.
A major driver of deforestation in the Amazon basin is soy cultivation. Global Forest Atlas mentions that seeds of soybean plant is rich in protein and 80 percent of Amazon soy is destined for animal feed; smaller percentages are used for oil or eaten directly. Brazil has 24-25 million hectares of land devoted to the growth of this crop which yields around 86.8 million metric tons of soybeans. It is currently the second largest producer of soybeans in the world following the US.

Tensions
The rainforest likely formed during the Eocene era (from 56 million years to 33.9 million years ago), is home to about 2.5 million insect species, tens of thousands of plants, and some 2,000 birds and mammals. Destruction of this region is a global concern and entails a global crisis. Brazilian state of Amazonas has declared a state of emergency over the rising number of fires in the region as it is the fourth most affected region, reports Euronews. Smoke emissions have grown thicker, even blocking sunlight from passing in the surface, almost blanketing half of Brazil with fumes. Smokes are even spilling into neighbouring Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, spreading into South Atlantic coast. The rainforest which contributes to the 20 percent of the Earth’s oxygen is burning at a record rate- 72,000 fires which is over 80 percent increase compared to the same period of the previous year according to Brazil’s research centre. Environmentalists warn that if the unprecedented burn leads to a point of no return, it could turn into dry Savanna and begin emitting carbon instead. Consequences of air pollution remain; as a ripple effect it could even harm agricultural productivity as the fumes settle on earth’s surface.
President’s response
Image credit: Isac Nóbrega/PR
According to Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) the fumes in wildfire is visible from space. Although tensions have spurred, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil who is indignant to international criticism argues that the figures are “lies”, accuses NGOs whose budgets have been cut to have started the fire, with no evidence. Furthermore, he adds that its use should not concern outsiders despite the alarming incident. After assuming the office, President had issued an open invitation to loggers and farmers to clear the land. Battling the President’s accusations, nonprofits have blamed Bolsonaro’s pro-development policies for sharp increase in Amazon deforestation.
The current government  is accused of “systematically dismantling Brazil’s environmental policy” by Danicley Aguiar of Greenpeace Brazil. The government has faced international pressure to protect the rainforest from illegal logging or mining activities. “I used to be called Captain Chainsaw, now I am Nero, setting the Amazon aflame,” the president said adding that Brazil lacks resources to fight the Amazon fire.
Fate of indigenous tribes 

Indigenous tribes are caught up in a battle between supporters of business and environmental protection and suffer direct consequences. More recently, an indigenous tribe from Ecuador had won a lawsuit against Big Oil, saving millions of acres of rainforest. Far-right leaders have been repeatedly attempting to offer them with incentives to give up the land in return for a “better life”. Power play in the region to illegally destroy land for cattle ranching and other agricultural ventures has burnt forests which is a home to 1 million indigenous people and 3 million species so far.
Amazon Basin is not burning alone 
The ongoing Amazon catastrophe is another emergency call after a series of wildfires in 2019. National Remote Sensing Centre of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) assessed the massive forest fires in February that broke out in numerous places across the Bandipur National Park of the Karnataka state in India and estimated the extent of burnt area to be about 10,920 acres five days. Another Asian disaster broke in Siberia where 3 million hectares were on fire by the end of July. Indonesian forest fire have been ongoing since early this year and getting worse with time.
Drought and hot temperature did not leave even the European region unaffected. United Kingdom has faced a series of 96 wildfires lasting from February to April. North American forests, Alberta, California, Washington State were also on fire this year. Wildfire Situation Summary Report published by Agriculture and Forestry – Forest Protection Division indicated that most of the incidents in Alberta were caused either by lightning or humans. Oceania too experienced fire more than twice the numbers from previous years. Australian bushfire season from 2017 has destroyed over 90 buildings. Two separate incidents of wildfire were witnessed in New Zealand. Large fire in Pigeon Valley, the country’s largest since 1955 were however under control.

Notable international efforts to combat consequences of environmental impact 

Ethiopian volunteers have planted over 350 million seedlings to reverse the impacts of decades of deforestation.
Swedish millionaire John Eliasch purchased 400,000 acres of the Amazon rainforest from a logging company for its preservation.
Two-fifths of European lands are now covered by trees.
Iceland is now replanting giant forests destroyed by the Vikings.
Paris goes car free for one Sunday a month to limit percentage of harmful emissions.

Amazon, an international concern 
#PrayForAmazonia, #PrayForAmazons #ActForTheAmazon are trending online around the world to denounce those who have not been doing enough to douse fire while drawing attention to protect the “Planet’s lung”.
French President Macron called for action in his tweet on 23rd August, “Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rainforest – the lungs which produces 20 percent of our planet’s oxygen – is on fire. It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 Summit, let’s discuss this emergency first order in two days! #ActForTheAmazon”
On 22nd August, António Guterres, the Secretary of UN tweeted, “I’m deeply concerned by the fires in the Amazon rainforest. In the midst of the global climate crisis, we cannot afford more damage to a major source of oxygen and biodiversity. The Amazon must be protected.”

Active efforts and actions urgently required 
Climate change initiatives will suffice ecological needs only when adequate patterns and sustainable measures are adopted. Sharper global strategy needs to be implemented to prevent such tragedy in the future. Damages done in the past and present need to be healed in order to aim for a richer sustainable future. The Convention on Biological Diversity, 29 December 1993, has three main objectives, a) conservation of biological diversity, b) sustainable use of the components of biological diversity, and c) fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources.
As embodied in the Convention, if governments and all sectors of society apply the concepts for conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity an utmost priority, we can experience a sustainable relationship between humanity and nature in generations to come. The application of these government led policies aren’t sufficient in themselves to restore the damage caused. Indigenous people who were viewed more as victims than as agents are actively participating since 2008 seeking roles to combat climate change. And their participation is crucial too, as they have centuries old methods passed down through generations which are difficult to discover through modern scientific practices.
There are ongoing efforts to “not ruin” the environment any more by people all over the world as individuals or as a group. There are centuries old experience passed down through generations and colossal amounts of research done by the scientific world. The culmination of all the knowledge around the world for the good of all is very hard to do, unless we start acting on it.
How should individuals respond? 
Here are some actions that should be everyone’s habit considering environmental vulnerability:

Reducing paper and wood consumption; reducing waste overall,
Reducing consumption of petroleum products,
Growing vegetables at home as far as possible,
Supporting campaigns, raising projects for awareness.

Nepali context

The 6th National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP), 2018 aims to provide biodiversity awareness, incentives and subsidies for farmers involved in in-situ conservation of indigenous breeds while encouraging sustainable production, consumption and sustainable resource management. Maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem and climate change planning is an ongoing priority. At this outbreak where forests are being destroyed by either human actions or by natural catastrophes, Nepal should prioritize preserving its forest areas and ecosystem. Development projects should be reassessed by conducting Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) according to Environment Protection Act (1997).
The proposed Nijgadh airport which requires cutting of around 2.4 million trees should be carefully considered. Instead, there should be considerable efforts to find unproductive or barren lands where building an airport would have less environmental impact. The place which is allocated for the Nijgadh airport already has a rich biodiversity which significantly helps against the effects of climate change. Besides, there are plenty of places in Nepal such as Mahabharata and Chure ranges among plenty others where protection or preservation of the natural resources will be paramount. On the ongoing worldwide efforts to combat climate change, Nepal can play a vital role. Not many places in Nepal are urbanized and there are still plenty of natural resources in this tourist destination of the world.
The world we live in is at the tipping point already and is changing rapidly, even more than we can imagine. It is predicted that by 2030, there will be a rise in average annual temperatures, sea levels and melting glacial levels. The aftermaths of this will adversely affect normal human life by decreasing efficiency levels, causing prolonged life altering diseases and so much more. This can only be averted if we act on it now. Nature deserves to breathe the way it’s supposed to; if we choose to act on it, so will we.

41,41,http://english.lokaantar.com/interview/think-equal-womens-health-nepal/,"Well-being is not just the absence of illness and injury.
Gender equality, with investment in gender-responsive services and infrastructure that meets the needs of women and girls, is essential for a world where all women achieve the highest possible standards of physical, mental, reproductive and sexual health throughout their lives.
As the global voice for women’s health, FIGO believes that the challenges women face – in their choices, pathologies and safety – cannot be solved in clinical isolation.
We asked Dr Kusum Thapa, President of NESOG (Nepal Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists), National Coordinator for FIGO’s PPIUD project in Nepal, and Senior Maternal Health Advisor at Jhpiego, about the barriers she sees to equal access of public services and sustainable infrastructure in Nepal, and innovations that are raising the status of women.

The theme of International Women’s Day this year is ‘Think equal, build smart, innovate for change.’ What does this mean to you in the context of women’s health?
Collective action is our shared responsibility, driving a gender-balanced world.
As women in medicine, we want to protect, promote and advance women’s health in general. To do this, we need to be able to gender balance the workspace: to design, plan and implement innovative solutions that address the emergent and intractable women’s health problems on a global scale.
Change should be based in the principles of integrated innovation, multisector collaboration, responsive design and rigorous evaluation of what is effective in the local context. Not only in maternal health, but women’s health in the broadest sense. We want to celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women in all the sectors.
Access to public services is essential for health and wellbeing, particularly primary care: but there is often a dangerous gap between men and women, rural and urban. Please could you address the biggest challenge you see for women in Nepal when it comes to accessing public services?
Gender stereotyping and discrimination are the biggest challenges I see for women in Nepal when it comes to access. It creates obstacles, not only to reproductive health services like contraceptive and abortion, but public services in general.
Stereotyping women as mothers within marriages is seen in policy and practice across Asia and the deeply patriarchal structure we live in. Marital status remains a pre-requisite for women to obtain sexual and reproductive health (SRHR) services in Nepal. Single women, unmarried women and women with different gender identities are unable to access SRHR services to the same extent.
Women are still dying of traditional harmful practices like Chaupadi (menstrual hut) and around 41 percent of women are married before the legal age, further increasing the rate of teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality.
Lack of education, infrastructure, lack of commitment and strong political will to implement on the ground further perpetuates the magnitude of the problems, despite strong polices in paper.
How is NESOG working to advance gender equity when it comes to access to public services?
NESOG is committed to advancing gender equity and access to public services. We have trained our frontline providers in gender sensitivity, and our approach to women’s health has always been women-centred. We are constantly striving to attain target 5.6 of Goal 5 on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and empower women to make informed decisions regarding health services.
Evidence demonstrates that where women’s right to health, including sexual and reproductive health, is upheld, they are more able to claim their education, work, and equality within the family and beyond. Approaching these issues in an integrated way is critical.
One of the ways we do this is through partnering with FIGO on the Postpartum IUD (PPIUD) Project. The project increases the capacity of healthcare workers to provide more comprehensive family planning options, specifically in the postpartum period.
OBGYNs are on the frontline of women’s health, and change. What is the most exciting innovation you have seen when it comes to accelerating progress for gender equality in your field?
The most gratifying and innovative work for me has been in response to gender-based violence in Nepal. Practices such as early marriage, forced marriage, non-spousal violence and other forms of exploitation still prevail, and I was lucky enough to take a lead in the healthcare response.
The Nepalese government has taken important steps to combat gender-based violence, and NESOG has been supporting a national protocol and training package on ‘Health Response to Gender Based Violence for Frontline Health Workers’ alongside Jhpiego and UNFPA. I feel fortunate to be working in an organisation which has these principles at heart. Nepal now has a Domestic Violence Act, government funding for programs on gender violence, and a hotline for survivors to register complaints.
We need to ensure that frontline health workers are equipped with the knowledge and skills to care for women suffering from gender-based violence. There is no unified training for health care workers to identify survivors, provide medical and emotional support, or carry out the necessary documentation and referrals. In many cases, medical evidence is not properly recorded, leading to low prosecution and conviction rates for rape cases.
Can you share a story that illustrates why healthcare systems must respond more directly to the specific healthcare needs of women and girls?   
It is a chilly night in rural hospital in Nepal. I have been asked to attend a young woman who is lying in a pool of blood as nurses rush around her. A mother of three small daughters, she is four months pregnant and badly beaten. After resisting her husband’s demands to terminate the pregnancy, she has paid a heavy price.
The woman had visited the health facility twice before, once with a black eye, once with bruises all over her back and arms. She said that she had fallen down the stairs.
If the provider had spent more time with her to understand the situation, she might not have been a victim of a repeat incident. The role of medical staff in identifying violence and providing non-judgemental, supportive treatment is key – but all too often this is done poorly, if at all.
Fortunately, Sita survived. But despite all our efforts, we could not save her unborn child.
Gender-based violence is a grave social and human rights concern affecting virtually all societies. Effective plans to strengthen health facilities and equip health workers to deal with gender-based violence are of utmost importance and could save lives.

The Global Service Camp was conducted in Nepal from 28 to 30 November. The sole distributor of Tata Motors in Nepal is ‘Sipradi Trading’ and it organized the Camp in the country.
Coinciding with this special event Lokaantar Team met with Mr. Ganesh Shetty, Head – Customer Care, Tata Motors, International Business, CVBU, and discussed about the various issues related to the performance of Tata Motors in Nepali market.

KP Sharma Oli-led government has completed its nine months. The government has claimed to have made positive developments at many fronts including in foreign affairs. Bimal Gautam and Sushil Pant from Lokantar caught up with Pradeep Gyawali, Minister, Foreign Affairs, to talk about foreign policies of the government and other related issues. Excerpts:
There have been comments that Nepal has given importance only to neighbouring countries and this has narrowed country’s foreign policy.
This comment is partially true. Due to political instability in the past, foreign policy could not get a positive direction. We are serious in overcoming it. We have been able to bring wayward foreign policy into track.
I have been telling that our foreign policy consists of four aspects. The first one is neighbourhood. Neighbours naturally get first priority. Second, our development partners like European countries, the US, Japan and so on. Third, labour destination countries where 3 million youths work. Their safety and dignity is in our foremost interest. Fourth, United Nations and multilateral regional organisations.
We have paid due attention to all these four dimensions. The PM is about to visit our development partner countries after successful completion of both the neighbouring countries. He will attend programmes in international forums. For example, he will attend Word Economic Forum.
I have visited Europe two times and Japan once. At the sidelines of the UN Assembly, I have talked with important officers in the US. We have been planning to form a bilateral consultation mechanism with the US at the foreign minister level.
So, rather than limiting ourselves to neighbours we have broadened our foreign relations.
We talk about balance in foreign policy but it is seen that top leadership of our southern neighbour has visited Nepal many times while no top leader from our northern neighbor has arrived so far.
Nepalis are concerned about it. PM Oli during his visit to China has invited both the Chinese President and the Premier to visit Nepal. I want to quote President Xi Jingping here. He said, “Nepal is in the journey of stability and prosperity. This is an appropriate time to visit Nepal. I will be there on an opportune moment.” I am confident that top Chinese leadership will come to Nepal on an appropriate occasion.
Both China and India have shown interest in bringing railway line to Nepal. Is it their goodwill or a strategy to stop one another’s influence?
It involves both aspects. But goodwill triumphs all other things. You should understand that railway project is Nepal’s proposal rather than a necessity for China or India. Nepal needs railways to join the world economy and be in tune with the rapid development the world has been witnessing.
We are happy that both our neighbours are positive on this project. Both the neighbours have signed memorandum of understanding with us on the issue of Keyrong-Kathmandu, Kathmandu-Lumbini and Raxaul-Kathmandu railway lines.
Both the countries have been carrying out feasibility studies. China has completed the study while India is still in the process. As soon as the feasibility study completes, we will prepare DPR and construction work will commence.
I think six or seven years after the DPR we will be connected with two of the biggest countries and rapidly developing economies through railways. Nepal will transform herself into a land-linked country from a landlocked country.
Both our neighbours may have their own interests in the project. China naturally wants to be connected with India’s big market and vice versa. Nepal can provide a good transit point for them. But I reiterate, this railways project is basically a part of Nepal’s development plan.
Why is SAARC stalled? Who hindered Nepal to transfer chair to Pakistan?
It is an unfortunate development. SAARC is a common forum for around 1 billion 800 million people in South Asia. It should function at any cost. Nepal always supports active and impactful SAARC.
There are disputes between countries but those discords should not obstruct any regional and international cooperation. SAARC is under the shadow of two big countries. Nepal has been continuously striving to bring SAARC out of the shadow and to build an environment of trust. We are not seeking any alternatives to SAARC. Maybe this regional organization is waiting for a favourable time to bounce back. All member states have the responsibility to vitalize it and Nepal has been doing her best on this.
It has been heard that India has refused to accept the report presented by Eminent Persons’ Group. Why could not the report be submitted?
India has formally replied that the PM is busy. That may be a reason for delay in accepting the report. The definition of Nepal-India relations will change after both the governments take ownership of the report and start implementing it. Multiple changes in the legacy bestowed by history to both the countries will change. Even if the countries are mismatched in geographical and population size, both will go ahead in the spirit of cooperation as sovereign countries with equal status.
We have cleared all doubts regarding the report with India’s Foreign Minister. Some sections of the society do not want to see the ties going forward in a positive direction and they might have wrongly briefed her about the report. But I am confident that all the obstacles will be overcome. Both the premiers have initiated this process and they want to see it arriving at a logical conclusion. I reiterate – EPG report and its implementation will bring about a huge change in ties. It will be a change for good.

India-Nepal relations are defined with a lot of cliches, but where do we stand right now?
India-Nepal relations cannot be measured within the parameters of diplomacy and politics. They encompass a shared culture, economics and a common way of life.
As a developing country which is just becoming a functional democracy, what are the aspirations of Nepal?
We aspire to first establish and stabilise the federal democratic republic. Secondly, Nepal is a country of diversity in geography, religion, ethnicity and language. We have to recognise these identities and address the problems of the various groups, to unify all.
Nepal is economically one of the least developed nations and we have economic aspirations. We have resources—hydro, tourism, agriculture—but they need to be developed.
What are your expectations from India?
India is our nearest neighbour and very closely related to us. Our life and future is together, so we have to move forward together for economic development. We have to be better developmental partners. We have hydro resources, India needs power. India has large lands, we have water for irrigation. Our cooperation needs to pick up pace. We need to pick up pace. We need to discuss the technical issues or financial issues that are slowing us down.
How do you define your relationship with China?
After India, there is China.
We have very good diplomatic relations with China. However, the dynamics we have with India are not there with China. We have an open border with India, there is a visa policy with China. Relations between India and China have improved vastly since the 1960s, and that is good for Nepal. If we all work together, our entire region will thrive.
There is a perception that Nepal is leaning closer to China.
When I go to India, I hear that Nepal is getting close to China. What I hear in China is exactly the opposite. In China, they even confuse us sometimes with Indians.
Why did Nepal pull back from the BIMSTEC military exercise?
That was a very small incident, it was not a definer of relations between two close countries. We sent observers, like Thailand did. Our internal preparations to participate in the exercise were not in place. We were not against the exercise, we simply weren’t ready. This is what the prime minister told me.
What are Nepal’s expectations from China?
Nepal is landlocked, it has only two options, India and China. Between China and Nepal, right now there is only one road, the Kathmandu- Lhasa highway, which is in bad shape after the 2015 earthquake. We would like China’s help in connectivity and infrastructure development.
Mr Modi has assured us that the rail link from India will come to Kathmandu very soon. China has also proposed a 78km rail link to Kathmandu. The day we have one train arriving from India and another from China, Nepal will be a connectivity hub. But this will not be easy. I do not see it happening in our generation.
China has offered its ports to us, but the closest Chinese port is 3,000 km away, Kolkata [less than 1,000 km away] remains the best option.
China cancelled some hydro electric projects with Nepal recently.
Yes, the Chinese cancelled the Seti and Budhi-Gandaki projects [the latter has been reissued to another Chinese firm]. They could not complete the works in time, so the companies decided to withdraw. They say the Nepal government did not co operate, Nepal says they failed to complete their task.
Does Nepal feel threatened by India?
Those who are closer to each other expect more from each other. These expectations may sometimes cause confusion. India has played a very vital role in establishing democracy in Nepal.
Your party, Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum, was against the constitution initially. Now you are part of the government. Have the issues been resolved?
Not yet. The constitution and the new constituencies are not adequately representative of the Madhesis, or the indigineous communities like Limbus, Gurungs, Sherpas and Tamangs. We decided to participate in the government on the assurance that these issues will be resolved once the constitution is amended.
The government is enacting laws to implement the constitution. Then, we will begin work on the laws for amending the constitution.
India was accused of interefering in the constitution-making process two years ago.
When there is a problem in the Terai, it affects India, as it is an open border. It is natural that India will show interest then. To suggest something for the betterment is not interference, to my mind.
But Mr Oli thought so.
That was a political move to work upon a vote bank. First, to create an anti-Indian sentiment, then to cash in on that. This happens even in India and Pakistan politics.
But after elections, those who raised these slogans are partnering with India, and even India reciprocated. These are vote bank politics and India knows that.
What is the future you see for Nepal at the end of your term.
In Nepalese politics is unpredictable. So, though we hope to complete the term, you can never tell. I hope that we achieve political stability and begin the starting of economic development.
What is Nepal’s foreign policy focus?
India and China are superpowers, we cannot compare with either. Nepal is sandwiched between these two, and for its safety, as well as development, we have to maintain neutrality. It is true that in practice, the people to people ties are are stronger with India, and we are also more reliant on India, but it is our compulsion to maintain neutrality.
But Nepal’s foreign policy is not restricted to India and China. Nepal has better relations with SAARC members than even India, we have no conflict with any country. We strongly feel that SAARC should be revived as a regional body. See how successful other regional bodies like the Arab League, European Union and African Union have been. But SAARC hasn’t succeeded beyond the ritual of summits largely because India and Pakistan bring their bilateral issues into the organisation, even though SAARC is clear that such matters should be kept out of it. Pakistan suggested that China should become a member, and there was further confusion.

When the country prepares to celebrate today the fourth anniversary of the promulgation of Nepal’s constitution drafted by the Constituent Assembly in 2015, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is confident that Nepal will move ahead in the path of ‘Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepali’ despite many challenges faced by his government. 
Here are the excerpts of his interview with government media including Rastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS), Radio Nepal, Nepal Television, Gorkhapatra and The Rising Nepal. RSS Chairman Shyamal, Chief Editor Shyam Rimal, Chief Reporter Tirtha Bhattarai and Senior Reporter Prakash Silwal were present in the interview with the PM: 

Mr. prime minister, what message would you like to convey to the Nepali people as the country enters fourth year of the promulgation of a constitution which is drafted by the Constituent Assembly. 
First of all, I would like to convey my hearty greetings and best wishes to all the Nepalese at home and abroad. We have passed three years of the promulgation of constitution. We are now in course of implementation the constitution, framing laws and building structures envisaged by the constitution aiming to address the aspirations of the people for better service- delivery.
Our utmost responsibility is to provide security and self-esteem to the people in general. We are moving ahead with clear outlook for the prosperity of the people.
We have now a majority government after we attained political rights, managed the conflict and even faced the devastating earthquake of April 2015.
We have now a federal republic achieved with proper acumen and participation of the people.
Our ancestors have a glorious history of innovations, researches and studies, which tell us that our land is naturally beautiful, fertile and prosperous. We have mines, flora and fauna, water resources, herbs and what not. We can attain prosperity from these all.
Our economic and technical capability may not be able to meet the aspirations for prosperity of the people. In view of this situation, we have developed high-level relations with our neighbours, friendly countries and international organizations in keeping with our national interest, national dignity and concern if there were any misunderstandings in the past. Although we were landlocked in the past, we are now not in a position to feel inferiority complex of being landlocked and want to seek cooperation from neighbours without compromising our national interests and concerns.
How do you evaluate these three years of new constitution as an executive head of government? 
The constitution has made the Nepali people sovereign. It has given its explanation, implementation process and its system in detail. The constitution has regarded the people as the source of sovereign power and its focal point.
I have been saying that I will not stay idle satisfied with the figures of per capita income or gross national production. There would not be any situation that any citizen will be deprived of food, clothing, housing and education of the children. This is the essence of the constitution. No one would die and no one will be allowed to die of hunger. Our destination is an equitable society. Not that everyone should have equal property, but that the state should give attention that no one should die of hunger.
We have admitted about 300,000 children to schools through especial enrolment campaign this year. We will run such campaign next year as well and ensure their continuation. This is a right to education guaranteed by the constitution. Our constitution has policies and procedures for incorporating all diversities of Nepal including geographical, linguistic, cultural and communal. It will ensure national unity.
As implementation of the constitution is on process, a party in government, which had reservations on constitution, has said it will not celebrate the constitution day. What initiative would you take for wider acceptability of the constitution? 
Some problems can be solved, but some cannot be when they are made a political issue. They are raised just as an issue, and cannot be solved. When one is hungry, he eats, but if he pretends as being hungry, he will not eat. He wants to keep the issue of hunger alive. He wants to show his hunger. I do not think we should give importance to them who pretend to be hungry.
There can also be some vested interest groups, infiltrators and some secessionists. The Nepali people themselves isolate and reject them.
However, we can adjust in genuine cases. Constitution is not as rigid as the religious scriptures. It is a progressive document and we are ready to discuss on matters, which can be amended. However, people will not support those who want to lead to disintegration in the name of amendment of the constitution.
You have been frequently raising the issue of good governance and security, but the provincial governments say that they do not have police force with them. There seem some misunderstandings between the centre and the province with regard to good governance. Moreover, there have been some challenges witnessed in security sector. Have you any plans to improve this situation? 
We should understand that the province is province, they are not separate states. We have a bicameral parliament in the centre, 753 local governments and 77 district coordination committee (DCC), which means a total of 761 governments, but they are not separate and independent from the centre. They are all organs of the Government of Nepal. The DCCs are also representative organizations of the people, they have their own responsibilities. The provinces will have provincial assemblies and governments, but we do not have infrastructures for their offices. Three years ago, I had planned for it, but some people spent time in the game of pulling down my government.
However, we have done a lot in the meantime. Several laws were formulated after this government came. There are provisions for local laws, judges and taxation. How could that be done, when no one was familiar to all this. If something is lacking, it should not be like parents giving away parental property to children and quarrelling over this. We can discuss and manage for the service of the people. There are also some tendencies of making hue and cry to spread anarchy.
As for security, our society lives with high values and ideals. We have Tharu community in Nepal, which has a family with more than hundred members, sharing the same kitchen. We cannot imagine such tolerance elsewhere in the world. Attempts are being made to weaken this. The decline of moral values has been transformed into social crimes. Animals do not cheat or conspire. However, when consciousness is used differently, it amounts to crime. At present moral values and norms are violated, in which we should all be careful.
How would you move ahead to make the implementation of constitution and concept of prosperity successful? 
Constitution drafting was challenging, but we faced this successfully. The constitution has been made in a way the Nepalese people had wanted, not in a way any others wanted. The torch-bearers of democracy should have maturity. There is not a long history of Nepali people exercising their sovereign rights. The main essence of democracy is to accept the peoples’ mandate. To shun democracy in any pretext is authoritarianism. However, the tendency of shunning democracy does not have future in Nepal.
Why did we coin the slogan ‘Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepali?’ It is based on the adage of our ancestors – Sarve bhavantu sukhinaḥ Sarve santu nirāmayāḥ (May all be prosperous and happy, May all be free from illness). Happiness comes from prosperity, but not from this alone. We cannot sleep when there is terror, fear and insult. Prosperity only is not sufficient for a man to be happy.
Happiness is the knowledge of our ancestors, the conclusions drawn by our saints and sages as well the philosophy of Karl Marx that sorrow should not only be explained but be transformed into happiness, and the conclusions by Puspalal and Madan Bhandari and the totality of the democratic republicanism. Political change is already there and now good governance and development is the path towards our prosperity. A seed is sown; it will bear fruit in the end. We want to reach the destination of prosperity and happiness through good governance and development.

Nepal’s decision to pull out of the joint BIMSTEC military drill in Pune couldn’t have come at a worse time for India with the Nepali Army set to participate in a 12-day-long joint military exercise with China from September 17 in Chengdu.
Nepal has thwarted India’s strategy to form a regional alliance excluding China and Pakistan by holding a joint exercise with China snubbing the BIMSTEC joint military drill. It is considered a major diplomatic setback for India.
Sputnik talked to Geeta Kochhar, professor of Chinese Studies in JNU and visiting scholar at Fudan University, China, on India-Nepal ties.
Sputnik: How do you view China’s latest overtures in Nepal?
Geeta Kochhar: China has a long history of military ties with Nepal. In fact, during the civil war, China helped King Gyanendra with military supplies. It is not new, just that now it is more open…. Recently, China has also helped Nepal build an academy to keep surveillance on people.
Sputnik: How will Nepal-China military ties impact India?  
Geeta Kochhar: I think India should not worry too much about these ties, but concentrate more on protecting its own borders from the illegal inflow of Nepalese in Indian territory that pose challenges to the stability of India and rise in human trafficking using India also a transit route.
In fact, we should follow China’s model of making stringent checkpoints on the India-Nepal border.
China has its own imperative to protect its investments and citizens in Nepal, while Nepal wants to take advantage of China to increase its capabilities.
Sputnik: What should be India’s strategy to counter China’s increasing influence in Nepal?
Geeta Kochhar: India cannot stop Nepal’s deeper engagement with China, but can limit its influence on India-Nepal relations.
As a sovereign nation, Nepal may want to engage with China, but India needs to build its own capabilities and think what it wants from Nepal and what can be offered to Nepal in a more holistic manner. A piece-meal strategy is no future of India-Nepal relations.

47,47,http://english.lokaantar.com/interview/nepal-china-relations-extraordinary-unprecedented-pm-oli/,"Government of both neighbours–China and India–have called Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli‘s slogan of ‘prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalis’ as ‘significant’, while recognizing it at the government level. In this light, Prime Minister Oli has described Nepal’s relation with China as extraordinary and unprecedented during an interview with RSS Special Correspondent Hari Lamichhane at the fag end of his six-day China visit in Lhasa of the Tibet Autonomous Region Saturday. Excerpts: 

Right Honourable Prime Minister, You have been serving tirelessly for Nepal and Nepalis since a very long time, where do you get this energy from? 
It has now become my habit to work for many hours a day. I don’t find it difficult to work for seventeen to eighteen hours in a day.
The Government of China welcomed you with high respect, while a 14-point joint statement has already been released. Overall, how enthusiastic can we become over it? 
Naturally, China is not only our immediate friendly nation but also a very reliable and everlasting cooperative friendly neighbour. A friendly nation, with whom we have never had any problems, and one who has always been supporting us. The agreements that had been reached during my previous visit here in March 2016 and the subsequent joint press statement were historical. The agreements in the joint statement are on matters that would guide Nepal to a new era and take Nepal-China relations to newer height. Taking those agreements forward and making them timely are the needs of the day. And we discussed accordingly, and hence there is no reason for us to not be optimistic in practice.
We are hopeful. The many agreements reached between us have been reflected in the joint statement. We have moved ahead in the area of increasing investment of the government as well as the private sector, and the support from the government side. There too, one would not find any reason not to be content.
Mr Prime Minister, railways was the subject of highest public concern during this visit. How strong has the possibility of Keyrung-Kathmandu railway become with the agreement reached in Beijing? 
Definitely, this is a matter that is yet to undergo a survey. So far it is a matter based on our aspirations. Chinese President Xi Jinping did clarify his vision of reaching railway service up to Kathmandu. This railways has already reached Shigatse and would ultimately be reaching to Kathmandu, Pokhara and then to Lumbini via Keyrung. For now, Kathmandu is the minimum destination.
What people feel strange about this is that we are talking about inland waterways and operating riverboats even though the world has made drastic changes in this sector. But we are working and we will mark the beginning of this soon. People find it weird when we talked about owning ports and operating ships and they considered it a strange too while proposing alternative routes and provision for transportation. Also many others considered it something different as we talked about the country’s graduation to a modern age. This is not something to be considered strange.
I have floated the slogan of Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalis to move ahead based on the systems of political and diplomatic affairs, social order, good governance and economic development. It has a valid reason. Under this very aspect, we are not talking just to touch our border land by the railway from any other country. The east-west railway, railway linking the capital city, Kathmandu-Pokhara railway, railway inside Kathmandu Valley, Thankot-Dhulikhel railway and Kathmandu-Birgunj railway are means for ensuring better connectivity to enter Nepal into a modern age. All areas of relations, transportation and information should be used for development in a modern way. So, again questions have been raised over the railways but we have agreed on finalizing the feasibility study and proceed ahead for other related works.
Agreement was made in Beijing on Nepal’s cargo transport and the Prime Minister also met with the Chief of Government of Tibet. Looking at these two developments, agreement and meeting together, how Nepalis can take benefits now? 
The agreement has been signed. We had a lot of difficulties to supply goods from one belt of the northern area of our own country to the rest part in the country. We had difficulties in case of supply of medicines or relief and rescue materials and supply essential goods in case of epidemic. In those circumstances, we used to use Tibetan highway temporarily. Now, that situation has been put to an end. Now, we can use the Tibetan highway in such times and we can supply goods in any belt of our northern region. It has been quite favourable for us. During my talks with the Chief of Government of Tibet twice, he was found to be very positive in this regard. Their aspiration is positive. Their support will be continued with supportive aspirations in a positive way.
You have been repeatedly saying that friendship is greater than the projects. While looking through the lens of friendship, what height this visit has offered to the bilateral relations? 
This is extraordinary, this is unprecedented. The agreement and joint statement of 2016 were extraordinary. The present one has further advanced the same. This is incredible.
The nation is opening multi doors for development and prosperity under your leadership. During the visit, you and Chinese President Xi held one-on-one meeting for about half an hour. Are new perspectives developing in new era? 
Definitely, I talked to President Xi for about 35 to 40 minutes on an individual basis and then 35 to 40 minutes in a group. Then talks were held with Chinese Premier for around an hour in the dialogue venue while around an hour on an individual basis. These talks have played an important role to strengthen bilateral relations in a multifaceted way.
In this hour, I want to share that Nepal is not involved in it lightly and does not want to develop diplomacy for temporary purpose. Some people say, north and south cards are used but we do not use any cards, we want to extend the hands of friendship with both neighbours. We don’t believe in using cards, we only believe in friendship. We want to extend our friendship to extend others’ friendships with their friends as well.
Finally, you are now on a China visit, few days ago you visited India, and people are eagerly waiting for a clear message of this visit, what is the purpose of this visit? 
In practice, I made a trip to India, which was followed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Nepal. Then bilateral projects are showing good results. Similarly, achievements of this visit will be seen gradually. Developing railways is not like using a magic stick. The process has begun for it.
Various hydro projects, industrial parks, industries and cooperation sectors have extended. Works have begun and would gain speed. Results will prove it. People used to think that silence is diplomacy, some other believe in diplomacy to tolerate whatever happens. But we move ahead keeping national interest, international laws and obligations in the centre. And we keep friendly relations in the highest place so our policies and priorities are right. We are moving ahead with success of these policies, which are already reflected in practice.

48,48,http://english.lokaantar.com/interview/local-polls-strengthened-nepals-democracy-give-local-representatives-time-deliver/,"Kathmandu, 14 June (2018) – Electing local representatives after a long gap has been an important milestone for the functioning of Nepal’s democracy, a political scientist has asserted.
Speaking with Lokantar Saad Gulzar, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Stanford University, said that local polls have strengthened Nepal’s democracy and newly elected local representatives should be given time to learn about their jobs.
“People ran for the offices for the first time as local polls took place in Nepal for the first time. There may be some anomalies in local representatives’ jobs but they are still learning,” Gulzar said.
Gulzar also said that it is important to devolve certain responsibilities to the local level so that people performing at the lower level can work for the benefit of the people and also rise up the ranks.
“Giving good services within their jurisdictions and matching the expectations of their electorate will ensure the rise of local politicians,” he said.
Gulzar suggested that it would be useful for local representatives to ask the people what they want and deliver the demands.

Dr Rajesh Bahuguna is currently Dean of Faculty of Law at Uttaranchal University, Dehradun, India. Considered an authority on Constitutional Law and Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) in India, he is subject expert at Uttrakhand Public Service Commission, Uttrakhand and different universities across India. His research articles have been published in leading international journals. Jivesh Jha for Lokaantar caught up with Dr Bahuguna this week to discuss about the statute. Excerpts:
The preamble of the Constitution acknowledges People’s War and a decade-long Maoist insurgency. How do you find this arrangement? Do you think it’s better to give priority to political movements than recognising established socio-legal principles?
The People’s war or Maoist insurgency has been acknowledged by the framers of the Nepali Constitution as they strongly believe that the ideals championed by these political movements gave birth to the new Constitution. It has a stamp of deep deliberation and reflects the declaration of people’s faith and belief in certain fundamentals of national life, a standard from which the state cannot depart anymore. It would serve as a guide to constitutional interpretation for the coming generations. Also, it would serve as a lamppost for enforcement authorities, judiciary or political class to adopt a logical discourse whenever they feel stuck at a point. In yet another sense, preamble serves the cause of the Himalayan state as it succeeds to accelerate the Victorian identity of Nepalis who are globally identified for their “martial race” having inherent quality of toughness, bravery, durableness and discipline. So, I find nothing wrong in it.
Nepal Constitution takes population and geography both into account while demarcating electoral constituencies. Do you think it’s a rational arrangement? 
Nepal Constitution has unfolded a new beginning by taking population and geography both into consideration as the basis for representation while delineating constituencies. It will ensure that the ratio of geography, population and number of representatives to be elected is in one way or the other equal across all constituencies without any distinctions. In a country like Nepal which has highly diverse geography and unequal development patterns, it’s unreasonable to take population the sole criteria for parliamentary seat allocation. The voice and concerns of smaller districts should be equally heeded in polity. Only people with myopic vision would criticise this welcome provision. I would suggest India to adopt the similar arrangement. This is the unique feature of Nepali Constitution.
Nepali charter has been criticised for its citizenship provision. A person is eligible to acquire citizenship by descent when it’s proved that ‘his/her father and mother both are citizens of Nepal.’ However, on non-fulfilment of this clause, meaning where a person whose ‘father or mother’ is a Nepali, s/he is entitled to get citizenship by naturalisation and naturalised citizens are barred from holding vital government offices. Isn’t it a discriminatory provision? 
Look, the citizenship provision, unlike constituency delineation, appears discriminatory. The population of a country can be divided into citizens and aliens and there is nothing in between. Once a person becomes a Nepali citizen, then s/he should not be discriminated against. The state should not discriminate between citizens. Once somebody becomes a Nepali citizen the state should not suspect their loyalty. It will never serve the cause of Nepal. Rather it could fuel tensions in society. It could render people stateless and could also become a cause of conflict. Along with this, the provision violates Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) convention as well. The Constitution seems to show that naturalised citizens are inferior to that of descent citizens and this is unreasonable. There ought not to be any kind of discrimination between citizens just because of their birth in particular families.

Nepali charter reserves 33 percent of positions for women in Nepal’s legislative spectrum. Do you think it will play a significant role in empowering women? 
Reservation itself is a form of discrimination but when it comes to women’s reservation I feel it is positive discrimination which ought to be promoted. This Constitutional provision would certainly increase the participation of women in politics and public life. It may just be a single step but is nevertheless a step ahead in the right direction. Now what remains is for these laws to be implemented in letter and spirit. It’s a welcome provision. However, there should be a limit on reservation.
Would you clarify these limitations? 
See, this mechanism has two dimensions. First, it plays a crucial role in mainstreaming the weaker section of society. Secondly, although reservation is important the society should avoid getting habituated to it. If reservation is continued for generations exclusively on the basis of caste, it will defeat the very object of the policy. Ultimately the professional standard would lose real quality which would help sluggishness prevail. Protective discrimination (i.e., reservation) should work as a support, not a lifelong crutch.
Caste-based reservations have proved fatal in India. At times, it is seen that richer [i.e. creamy layer] sections (who actually don’t need reservation) gain success through reservation quota. It has done great damage to the rest and ensured that actual people who deserve reservation remain as miserable and poor as they were before. Earlier, reservations were proposed to stay in place for a conditional period of 15 years only, but continuing it forever has certainly helped vested interests to grow and it has already divided the Indian population artificially along the lines of caste and creed to a great extent.
I would like to borrow the words of Justice Markandeya Katju who has recently made a significant remark: Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has appealed to the well off to give up subsidised cooking gas but the irony is that he is yet to appeal the richer sections of society to give up the benefits of reservation so that the poor and the needy could benefit the most. Why has PM Modi not dared to call for giving up of caste-based reservation?
It’s unfortunate that caste-based reservation and politics has become a tool to cash vote bank in India. The caste-based reservation leads to creation of a mindset in a section of society that anyone is entitled to certain benefits just because one is born in a particular caste. People have started claiming reservation as an inherent right. I would suggest Nepal to refrain from enacting any law that would ensure caste-based reservation.
Do you think provisions relating to judicial appointments are healthy?
The charter offers government of the day a say in entire appointment process which is unfortunate. The judiciary under political clout would obviously fail to administer fair and reasonable justice.
The Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal must not waste time exploring alternatives when the answer exists in Constitutional framework itself and need of the hour is to consolidate efforts and focus energies on implementing laws in both letter and spirit.
This is the seventh Constitutional document in Nepal. Given some conflicting provisions, do you think that this Constitution will sustain?   
There is a qualitative difference between the repealed Constitutions and the 2015 Constitution. Previous Constitutions were crafted by monarchs but this has been enacted by elected representatives in Constituent Assembly. This is a positive difference and a reason to celebrate. So, I believe that the Nepalis, especially people in Southern plains, should not be disappointed with a handful number of conflicting provisions. Legislature and judiciary both should play an active role in bringing reformation which would ultimately turn fruitful for the nation. Then, the Nepali Constitution would also become a broad-based document, leaving the conflicting provisions far behind.
The Constituent Assembly (CA) gave birth to the new Constitution on September 20, 2015 with an aim to upright the newborn republic on a strong pitch of pluralism and representative socio-economic-political democracy and to establish Nepal as an ideal state in Asia.
Nepal has adopted a Constitution (which is enacted by the Constituent Assembly for the first time) and like all other Constitutions in the world this too will mature and evolve. So, there is no reason to be disappointed with certain provisions. They can be amended. Judiciary should play an active role in spearheading the cause of people. In India, judiciary has helped democracy flourish despite repeated failures of other organs. Nepal’s higher judicature could play an instrumental role in cementing walls of fundamental rights and knocking down all the boundaries resting upon discrimination, bias, prejudice or undemocratic principles.
What should state do to ensure a wider ownership of Constitution? 
It is truism that law alone can never rid society of conflicts linked to systematic discrimination, oppression or poverty. The Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal must not waste time exploring alternatives when the answer exists in Constitutional framework itself and need of the hour is to consolidate efforts and focus energies on implementing laws in both letter and spirit. Mere enactment is not going to serve the cause of nation. The future of Constitution depends on how agitating groups are included in the mainstream by offering required amendments. Every Constitution has scope of amendment to ensure its wider ownership. Interestingly, Constitution of Nepal is flexible in terms of amendment as it provides that two-third majority can amend any provision except sovereignty and integrity. The success of the Constitution will also depend on how the state handles legitimate concerns of the national population as well as international players.

Pratima Sherpa, a 19-year-old amateur golfer from Nepal, will make her first appearance in a professional event on the Symetra Tour later this month.
Sherpa, the subject of an Emmy-winning SC Featured installment last April, will play in the IOA Championship presented by Morongo Casino Resort & Spa on a sponsor exemption March 29-31 in Beaumont, California. She is looking to become the first female golf professional from Nepal.
“Being from Nepal and from a poor family, I had never imagined my identity could become a national golfer of Nepal and today I am in the USA because of golf,” Sherpa said in statement released by tournament organizers. “I feel so proud to say that I am the first Nepali who has been invited by the LPGA to play in a tournament with the Symetra Tour. This is a really big opportunity in my life. In fact, this is like an achievement for my country.”
The SC Featured piece showed Sherpa’s golf journey, which began while she was living with her parents in the maintenance shed at Royal Nepal Golf Club. She came to the U.S. in January to live with the Montano family in Ventura, California. She is a student at Santa Barbara City College and practices with its golf team. She previously came to live with the Montano family in the summer of 2017.
“I have always had a dream to play on the LPGA. I never imagined that dreams can become a reality in such a very short time,” Sherpa said. “I always follow two things in my life: nothing is impossible and hard work always pays off. Being invited by the LPGA and Symetra Tour has helped me to prove these things.”

The Ministry of Youth and Sports has prepared a 15-year master plan in a bid to boost up the country’s sagging sports sector. The master plan is all set for implementation from this year. 
The Ministry has come up with a new master plan realising the lack of vision, long-term goals and a well-organised system for the development of sports sector in a strategic manner as per the letter and main spirit of the slogan – Sports for Health, Sports for the Nation – determined in the 13th National Plan (2013 -2016). 
Talking to RSS, the national news agency, here today, Minister for Youth and Sports Jagat Bahadur Sunar (Bishwakarma) said the master plan has been prepared for enhanced development of the sports sector while confronting challenges like lack of physical infrastructures for organising national and international sports competitions and of the private sector participation in this sector. 
Goals have been set to complete works within five, ten and 15 years in the master plan. Thirty-three per cent women participation in sports within five years, 45 per cent within 10 years and 50 per cent within 15 years under wider and inclusive participation have been proposed in the master plan. 
Similarly, the master plan has also set a plan to construct basic physical infrastructures of sports, arrangement of sports coach in all schools of the country within five years, at least one football ground and cricket ground of international standard in all provinces within 10 years and one multi-purpose sports village in each province within 15 years. 
The ambitious goals including standing at third position in South Asian Games within five years, winning bronze medal in Olympic within 10 years, organising Asian Cricket Tournament within 10 years and organising Asian Games in Nepal within 15 years are in the master plan. 

Maintaining sports discipline by strengthening sports-related organisations, encouragement to players, coaches and sports human resources, developing international relation for the development and expansion of sports and mobilizing cooperation are incorporated in the master plan. 
The master plan has focused on encouraging people with disabilities to pursue sports by their choices and need. Local, national and international cooperation and collaboration will be sought in implementing the plan. Likewise, an economic strategy will be adopted to attract donor agencies and international aids for the plan through various means like Nepali embassies in foreign countries. 
The government has a plan to construct a well-equipped sport village in each constituency, and has incentive and social security programmes for athletes and coaches like the management of social security by categorising athletes and coaches contributing to national and international sports and ensuring their professional security.

Attracting lots of spectators on the field, DPL managed to successfully end up it’s first day of opening where CYC Attariya managed to win the first game of the tournament.
The Charm of CYC Attariya
On it’s first game, Kathmandu Goldens playing against CYC Attariya, won the toss and decided to field first. Led by team captain Gyanendra Malla, CYC openers could not give a fine start to their team.
Sandeep Sunar stumbled against Sompal Kami losing his wicket on his fifth bowl adding four runs on the scoreboard. The big names Gyanendra Malla, Mehboob Alam could not perform well along with Dilip Nath who was also a part of Emerging Cup tour to Bangladesh.
Yogendra Singh Karki being the first cricketer to score a half century of the tournament, built a much needed inning with 57 personal runs, which included seven boundaries and a six off 41 bowls. Gyanendra Kunwar added not out 34 runs on the board while it was surprising to see Pradeep Airee at late order who smashed 13 runs off 5 bowls.
With two wickets for Sompal Kami and an each in the names of Manjeet, Santosh and Rohit, Goldens stopped CYC for 146/6 in 20 overs.
Chasing the target of 147 runs, Goldens’ inning was most devastating than Nepal Earthquake with only Sompal Kami and Santosh Bhatta managing to score double digits runs on their heroic innings.
A surprise was the captain Basant Regmi coming to bat as a third number batsman who scored seven runs before returning back to the pavilion.
On his another good inning, Sompal Kami took their innings till nineteenth over scoring 40 runs off 38 bowls along Bhuvan Karki scoring 31 runs off 23 bowls.
Avinash Bohara took 4 wickets to take the Man of the Match award with only 11 runs off his 3.4 overs spell.
Alongside, Binod Lama also took 3 wickets giving away 9 runs. The Goldens only managed to score 106 runs losing all their wickets in 18.4 overs to lose the match by 40 runs.
Goods:
Avinash Bohra’s Bowling Spell : 3.4-0-11-4

The Challenging Rupandehi Challengers
Rupandehi Challengers won the toss and decided to bat first in the second game of DPL playing against Kanchanpur Iconic. Batting first, the openers duo Harishankar Shah and Shankar Rana gave their team a fine start.
With maximum use of the batting powerplay, the team managed to score 60 runs off first 6 overs without losing their wicket. With 60 runs on the board, the first wicket stumbled as Shankar Rana who scored 19 runs.
The wicket kept falling on the regular intervals where Harishankar Shah scored 33 runs off 24 bowls with four boundaries and two sixes.
Kushal Bhurtel was the man from the Kanchanpur’s side who took four wickets to stop Rupendehi challengers to 145/8 at 20 overs. Prakash KC scored 26 runs while captain Shakti Gauchan scored 16 runs. Avinash karna took two wickets.
Chasing the target of 146 runs openers duo Sagar Pun and Sunil Dhamala gave a fine start with a partnership of 52 runs.
Similar to previous inning, other batsman including skipper Binod Bhandari could not play a good inning to guide towards the target. Sagar Pun scored 39 runs off 38 bowls with two each of boundaries and sixes.
Sunil Dhamala scored 28 runs of 35 bowls. Though, Kushal Bhurtel hit some fine shots towards the end, his return towards pavilion at stage of 116/9 seemed difficult for the victory.
Kanchanpur iconic needed 25 runs to win after Kushal scored 27 runs off just 13 bowls with 3 boundaries and 2 sixes. Dipesh Shrestha was hit 10 runs off the last over yet Kanchanpur Iconic lost the match by 14 runs against Rupandehi Challengers.
Krishna Karki and Sahab Alam took 3 wickets each while Shakti Gauchan took 2 wickets for Rupendehi Challengers.

58,58,http://english.lokaantar.com/sports/aston-villa-leeds-united-draw-1-1/,"England, 29 Dec – Jonathan Kodjia’s late penalty preserved Aston Villa’s unbeaten home record in the Championship as they salvaged a draw against in-form Leeds.

Pontus Jansson headed the visitors ahead from a corner after the break and the defender then hit the crossbar.
After Liam Cooper handled under pressure in the box with four minutes left, Kodjia equalised from the spot.
There was still time for Leeds winger Hadi Sacko to hit the bar and Rob Green to deny Kodjia a winner.
Leeds missed the chance to move up to third but climb a place to fourth, while Steve Bruce’s Villa are now five points off the play-off places.
Villa were the better side in the first half, with Kodjia and Jordan Ayew forcing saves from Green, but the game came to life when Garry Monk’s side took the lead.
On-loan centre-back Jansson was left unmarked and powered a header at Mark Bunn, but the Villa keeper was unable to stop it crossing the line.
Leeds, who had won eight out of 10 heading into the match, looked likely to emerge victorious until the hosts were awarded a penalty for Cooper’s handball after referee Roger East had consulted with assistant Andrew Garratt.
There were chances at both ends in a frantic finale, with Jansson having an effort from close range blocked and Kodjia shooting wide moments after being foiled by Green.
Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce: “It’s the best Leeds team I’ve seen in a good few years.
“They’re confident, playing well and you can see that in abundance. But we stuck at it and got a point out of the game.
“We might have nicked it and I think that might have been a bit unfair.
“We’re still unbeaten at home but we’ve got a lot of work to do, I’m under no illusions about that. We’re still a long way away from where we need to be.”
Leeds United boss Garry Monk: “We got the goal and had two or three really good chances that you have to take.
“Had we taken one of them I think we would have won the game quite comfortably.
“But a good team like Aston Villa, who are very experienced, stuck in there and had their chances as the game went to and fro towards the end.
“It shows how far we’ve come that we’re disappointed not to win here against a team that have a fantastic record at home.”

59,59,http://english.lokaantar.com/sports/liverpool-defeats-stoke-city-4-1/,"England, 27 Dec – Liverpool closed the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to six points and moved to second in the league after maintaining their unbeaten home record with a convincing victory over Stoke.

Jon Walters headed home at his near post, highlighting the home team’s vulnerability in defence, to give Stoke an early lead.
But Liverpool responded positively after a disjointed start, with Adam Lallana and Roberto Firmino scoring before the break as the hosts took the lead.
Jurgen Klopp’s men made sure of the win, which moves them one point ahead of third-placed Manchester City – whom they play on New Year’s Eve – when Giannelli Imbula directed Divock Origi’s cross into his own net.
Adding gloss to the scoreline was Daniel Sturridge, who scored his first league goal of the season – and Liverpool’s 100th under manager Klopp.

China, 22 October (2019) – The 2019 South China Sea Buddhism Shenzhen Roundtable was held in Shenzhen city of China, attracting Buddhist leaders and scholars from 18 countries including Nepal, and others from the South China Sea region.
The topic of mutual learning among civilizations were discussed over the meeting with a call for concerted efforts to enable exchanges among Asian civilizations and to foster closer bond among peoples in a bid to share the outcome of civilization development.
Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli also sent a message to the round table meeting stating that China and Nepal are friendly neighbors in terms of culture, economy and politics, according to the organizers.
The PM hoped the meeting could set a new path for worldwide and, in particular, South Asia Buddhist academic research and development. During the event, six consensuses were reached by Monks from 14 countries for mutual learning for shared development.
The theme of the 2019 South China Sea Buddhism Shenzhen Roundtable was “Mutual Learning for Shared Development”.
In the deliberations, the scholars indicated that the world is facing mounting instability and uncertainties, and called on Buddhist leaders to comply with the times, explore innovations, and work together in keeping Buddhism up-to-date so as to adapt to and lead the new era.
The participating monks and abbots pledged to strengthen international cooperation and innovative development of the Buddhist community, to continuously enhance the Buddhist cooperation in countries surrounding the South China Sea and beyond, to facilitate exchanges on Buddhism affairs, maintaining the existing Buddhist cultural system and to jointly create new types and new modes of Buddhist cultural communication and others.
At the event, Maitri, President of All Nepal Bhikkhu Association, pointed to the sound cooperation between Chinese Buddhist Association and its counterpart in Nepal.
He believed in the role of Buddhist doctrine in promoting world peace. This year marks the fourth consecutive year of the roundtable, with the participation of new Buddhist leaders from Nepal, Singapore, India, the Philippines, Indonesia and others. RSS

The Secretariat of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) announced to launch the Global Economic Development and Security Forum meant for promoting multilateralism and facilitating the common issues of development. The first high-level meeting of the Global Economic Development and Security Forum is scheduled to take place in China in 2020, according to the officials.
It is argued that BFA set up the “Global Economic Development and Security Forum” in response to the needs for interactions in an ever-changing international environment and provide a high-level dialogue and exchange platform focusing on new economic drivers and hot-button security issues.
At a news conference in Beijing today, Secretary General of BFA LI Baodong argued that the sub-forum was initiated as a dedicated platform to explore the topic of economic development and security..
According to LI, the world economy is confronted with lackluster growth, unbalanced development, as well as growing problems in financial security, food safety, logistics security and ecological security. “While the application of new technologies such as the Internet and big data has provided new growth opportunities, it has also brought new challenges in cyber security, digital economy, and information & privacy security. International economic cooperation needs to address such emerging issues as public security governance, cross-border investment and security,” he shared.
He was of the view that interrelationship between economic development and security becomes increasingly evident because it attracts growing attention as a major international issue.
Likewise, President of the Global Economic Development and Security Forum Tsang Waihung said that economic development and security are always correlated but added that the world economic development and security are under pressure.
He said “Countries face issues such as coping with international economic frictions, preventing financial risks, maintaining ecological security, ensuring energy and resources security, ensuring food and water security, and maintaining fiscal sustainability. The social security issues caused by the widening gap between the rich and the poor and unemployment also merit our attention.”
Non-traditional security situation is becoming more complex though countless efforts are being made, he said, adding that the issues of terrorism threats, trans-border drug trafficking, and trans-national organized crimes haven’t been uprooted.
According to Tsang, we need to strengthen our security response not only on the “pragmatic” side, such as improving the law enforcement cooperation mechanism, but also on the “facilitating” side, providing platforms for all to voice their opinions, especially to expand the mechanisms for regular dialogue and cooperation. Either in Asia or across the world, there are still very few dialogue and cooperation mechanisms in this regard.
Likewise, Executive Director of Global Economic Development and Security Forum Lei Qiang said security issue is interconnected for the economic development while pitching for a high-level dialogue forum for promoting innovative economic development.

East will meet west at a new business in Swatara Township.
Mom’s Momo & Deli will open in mid-May at a former Subway restaurant at 5550 Derry St. with sandwiches and Nepali cuisine.
Co-owner is Subash Sharma, a partner at the nearby Nirvana Kitchen in Susquehanna Township, who said he was looking for another business opportunity in the area. When he saw the Subway had closed, he said he wanted to bring deli fare back.
“We want to have the same kind of food. In addition, we want the Nepalese food, the dumplings and all,” he said.
In 2017, he opened Nirvana Kitchen, serving Indian, Nepali and Bhutanese foods. It was one of the first restaurants on the East Shore serving food from Nepal, and has since been joined by others including Everest Spice and Bhojan Ghar.
The Nepal population has grown on the East Shore in the past decade with a large concentration of families living in the Rutherford and Lawnton neighborhoods.
Sharma moved here from New York City where he worked in delis. He is also a partner at Pint’s bar on Fourth Street in Harrisburg.
He said Mom’s will be a new concept for the area. The restaurant will use Boar’s Head deli meats and cheeses for sandwiches and also serve Nepali specialties including momos, little purses of steamed dough accompanied by sauces.
In addition, Sharma said they will sell a hard-to-find specialty item but customers will have to wait. He’s keeping it under wraps until the opening.
Mom’s will be open Tuesday through Sunday. It will be closed on Mondays.

A former Stockton couple convicted in a human trafficking case faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for physically abusing, exploiting and threatening workers they hired from India and Nepal under false pretenses, authorities announced Monday.
After an 11-day trial in federal court, a jury on Thursday convicted Satish Kartan, 45, and his wife, Sharmistha Barai, 40, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Sacramento.
The married couple was found guilty of conspiracy to obtain forced labor and two counts of obtaining forced labor. Kartan also was found guilty of fraud in foreign labor contracting.
“These defendants exploited one victim after another, using them to labor in their home, failing to pay wages and depriving them of basic human rights,” U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott said in the news release.
 
From February 2014 through October 2016, Kartan and Barai hired people from overseas to do domestic work in their Stockton home.
Federal prosecutors said the Stockton couple made false claims about wages and work duties in advertisements seeking workers online and in India-based newspapers.
After the workers arrived in Stockton, Kartan and Barai forced them to work 18 hours a day while depriving the workers of sleep and food, according to the prosecutors. They said few of the workers were paid a wage.
The defendants kept the workers from leaving their jobs “by threatening them, by creating an atmosphere of fear, control, and disempowerment,” according to the news release. Several workers also were threatened that attempts to leave their jobs would be reported to police of immigration officials.
Sean Ragan, Special Agent in Charge of the Sacramento FBI Field Office, said Kartan and Barai did more than simply fail to pay victims for their work.
“They deprived (the workers) of their dignity and robbed them of their federally protected civil rights,” Ragan said in the news release.
Some of the workers who said they were victimized by the Stockton couple flew from India and Nepal to testify in the trial.
The abuse became worse when a workers pushed back or wanted to leave. The prosecutors said the couple at times hit or burned the domestic workers.
The defendants hit one worker on multiple occasions, according to prosecutors. Testimony in the trial indicated that Barai backhanded the worker across her face for talking back, and slammed her hands down on a gas stove, which resulted in first- and second-degree burns on her hands. The prosecutors said Barai also threatened to kill the worker and throw her bones in the garbage.
Kartan and Barai are scheduled to be sentenced June 6. The maximum sentence they each face also includes a potential $250,000 fine.
“Human trafficking is a disgraceful and unacceptable crime,” U.S. Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division said in the news release. “The defendants in this case took advantage of overseas workers, forcing them to work without pay, physically abusing them, and threatening negative repercussions if they tried to leave.”

64,64,http://english.lokaantar.com/world/christchurch-mosque-massacre-49-confirmed-dead-shootings-four-arrested-three-men-one-woman/,"
Forty-nine people have been killed and 48 more hurt after mass shootings at two Christchurch mosques in the worst terror attack on New Zealand soil.
Anxious family and friends are pacing outside Christchurch Hospital, waiting for news of injured loved ones.
Wailing and crying can be heard at intervals, as people learn their friends will not be coming home.
“We just got some very bad news,” said Mahdi Zougub, as his friends hugged nearby.
“We think our friend… we think he’s gone. There’s a lot of emotion.”
Zougub, 22, said he was on his way to the Deans Ave mosque when a friend called and told him about the shooting. He wasn’t allowed inside.
“I could see dead bodies. Now we are just waiting to hear the story with our missing ones. We just want to go in and find them.”
Some of the shooting victims have been released and allowed to go home.
One, with a wound on his hand and another on his leg, said his phone and wallet were in the mosque and he had no way to call a taxi.
“I can’t believe it,” he kept saying.
“My children… I’m just relieved I didn’t take them to prayer today.”
A social worker eventually helped the man get a cab – although there are long lines as many of the taxi drivers are from the affected community.
Armed police remain stationed outside the hospital.
Canterbury District Health Board chief executive David Meates said it had been a tragic day.
“What we have been dealing with today is 48 gunshot wounds that were presented at Christchurch Hospital. So we have had 12 operating theatres that have been operating since this afternoon and will be continuing through until about midnight.”
Patients’ gunshot injuries ranged from “really critically injured” through to lesser wounds.
“With the size and scale of the operations we are doing today, many of those will end up having multiple operations over the coming days and weeks due to the nature of the wounds they have got.”
Meates said a “mass casualty plan” had been activated: “It is something that we plan for and hope we never have to activate, and we have had to activate that today,” he said.
“That involves us pulling in surgeons, nurses, doctors, support staff to enable us to respond, and we start deferring non-critical surgeries.”
Meates said there had been over 200 family members on site at the hospital today.
“We have been working really closely with the Muslim community, police and other agencies to make sure we have the appropriate support structures in place.”
The hospital would accommodate families who needed to stay there overnight.
Man, 28, charged with murder, due in court on Saturday
Police Commissioner Mike Bush said the shootings were “abhorrent”. At the Deans Ave mosque 41 people were killed, while seven had died at the Linwood mosque. A 49th person had died in hospital.
One man, 28, had been charged with murder and was due to appear in Christchurch District Court tomorrow morning.
“Two others remain in custody,” Bush said.
“Another person was arrested earlier today however that was not related to these events.”
Speaking about the victims Bush said: “Our love and thoughts go out to them and all of their family, all of their friends and all of their loved ones.
“We have staff around the country making sure everyone is safe, including armed offenders at all mosques. Police staff have gone above and beyond to protect people today.”
Bush said police recovered a lot of firearms from both the Linwood Avenue and Deans Ave shooting scenes.
None of the four people initially arrested had been on any terrorism watch, including in Australia, the Police Commissioner said.
Bush said he has “no intelligence” on a potential attack on St Patrick’s Day threat that has been reported. He was not aware of today’s attacks being linked to any other terrorist plots.
Police were not “actively” looking for any of the potential attackers now.
Christchurch police had a force of 1000 staff, and Bush said he would expect “everyone of them” would want to be out on the streets now. Additional officers were being flown to Christchurch from Dunedin and surrounding areas.
PM: ‘Unprecedented’ terrorist attack
Earlier tonight, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had said the death toll was 40. She said a further 20 people were seriously injured, while Christchurch Hospital has just confirmed 48 people suffered gunshot wounds.
Ardern said it was an “unprecedented” situation and described it as a terrorist attack.
“It is clear that this can only be described as a terrorist attack. From what we know, it does appear to have been well planned. Two explosive devices attached to suspects’ vehicles have been found and they have been disarmed.”
Those in custody had not been on any terrorism watch list: “It’s not a matter of someone having slipped under the radar,” Ardern said.
“There are currently four individuals who have been apprehended but three are connected to this attack and are currently in custody, one of which has publicly stated that they were Australian-born.
“These are people who I would describe as having extremist views that have absolutely no place in New Zealand and in fact have no place in the world.
“While we do not have any reason to believe at this stage that there are other suspects, we are not assuming that at this stage.
Ardern said it was obvious the attacks had been planned for some time. Three people were arrested in relation to the attacks, while one other was arrested separately.
Ardern said she could not give any more detail about the alleged offenders.
An Australian-born suspect had been in New Zealand “a relatively short time”.
She said she was asking questions about them, including access to firearms, of her officials.
The National Security Threat Level had been lifted from low to high.
The Defence Force was transporting more police to Christchurch.
Ardern said New Zealand was a place of safety where they raise their families.
“Those values will not and cannot be shaken,” she said.
“This is a place where people should feel secure.”
David Meates, chief executive of Canterbury District Health Board, said Christchurch Hospital and other health clinics were treating 48 patients for gunshot wounds.
The people shot range from young children to adults and injuries ranged from critical to minor.
Twelve operating theatres were currently in use and many people would need multiple surgeries.
There was sufficient capacity and staff at Christchurch Hospital, Meates said.
Four arrested after massacres at mosques
Gunmen opened fire at mosques in Christchurch earlier today. Four people are in custody – three men and one woman.
Police Commissioner Bush said “there have been some absolute acts of bravery” in the arrests of the four attackers.
A number of IEDs that were attached to vehicles in Christchurch have been defused by the Defence Force.
Bush said there were multiple casualties – a “significant” amount.
“This is absolutely tragic. So many people are affected.”
“We don’t have the identities of those who have died yet because those places are in lockdown.”
He said he would not assume there aren’t other attackers.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed one of the gunmen was an Australian citizen living in New Zealand.
Morrison said he was “shocked, appalled and outraged,” at the attack.
“We stand here and condemn absolutely the attack that occurred today by an extremist, right wing, violent terrorist.
“[He] has taken the lives,” he said, before correcting to: “they have stolen the lives in a vicious, murderous attack that has claimed so many New Zealanders.
Morrison said the attack reminds us about the evil that is ever present and would seek to “strike us out at any time.”
The lock down of schools throughout Christchurch was lifted at 5.50pm.
When asked if it was true that a person had been arrested wearing wired explosives, Bush said that person had been made safe.
“We’re still working through that but we believe there was a claim but that person has been made safe.”
Bush said he was aware that footage of the Al Noor Mosque shooting was on social media and police were doing everything they could to get it removed.
“It shouldn’t be in the public domain.”
Facebook Australia-New Zealand policy director Mia Garlick said the videos have been taken down.
“New Zealand Police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the livestream commenced and we quickly removed both the shooter’s Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video.”
He said police did not have conclusive information about the motivation behind the shootings.
He would not call it a terrorist attack but said it did not get any more serious in this country.
“We are currently dealing with an unprecedented situation in New Zealand. It’s very grave, it’s very serious.”
One of NZ’s darkest days
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called it “one of New Zealand’s darkest days”.
A body has been seen lying near Al Noor Mosque in central Christchurch and a second gunman has been seen near Linwood Masjid mosque.
One of the gunmen broadcast live as he shot victims.
One of the gunmen is believed to be an Australian who has written a manifesto declaring his intentions. In it, he says “it is a terrorist attack.”
The Herald has chosen not to report its contents.
Ardern described the event as “extreme and unprecedented violence”.
She will be flying to Wellington where she will speak with agents as soon as she lands.
“I’m not currently in a position to confirm the number of deaths or injuries,” Ardern said.
“This is and will be one of New Zealand’s darkest days.”
Ardern looked to be struggling to keep her emotions in check as she spoke.
Bush said Police are pouring resources into the Christchurch area.
He said they were also setting up a facility so that people could get phone in and get more information about their loved ones as a priority.
Bush said Defence Force aircrafts in Wellington were ready to fly more resources into the area.
“I want to assure the public we are doing everything we can to make sure there is no more harm to their communities.”
There was no indication there were other shooters at large.
The multiple fatalities were at two locations – a mosque at Deans Ave and one at Linwood Ave.
St John said there have been multiple fatalities.
People suffered injuries ranging from minor through to critical gun shot wounds.
A number of helicopter and road ambulances are on standby to provide support, including transporting patients to other ICUs around the country.
St John has deployed resources from throughout the country to provide cover for the next few days.
A Christchurch Star reporter saw a dead body lying close at Palazzo Lane near Al Noor Mosque.
The body has been covered with clothing.
A witness has seen a child lying in the middle of Deans Ave and another man has told the Herald his relative was shot inside the mosque.
It is understood the shooting at the mosque lasted six minutes and that the shooter may have returned to his car to retrieve more ammunition before opening fire again.
A large cordon has blocked off Strickland St around 3km from the Hagley mosque shooting.
A local man said a white van is at the centre of police focus. They believe a bomb is suspected to be inside.
The police bomb disposal unit is at the scene.
A Christchurch woman has reported watching a man being arrested on Harrow Street.
Images captured of the scene show a man being apprehended by a police officer. Two police cars are stationed nearby, blocking off the street.
‘I saw people drop dead in front of me.’
A man, who would only be known as Nour, who crawled to safety amid the carnage of the shooting has told Christchurch Star of what happened.
Nour in the front row of prayers when the gunman came in.
“First he shot people outside. Then he came in the front,” he said.
He heard the gun being reloaded about three times.
The gunman began shooting in all directions.
“I saw people drop dead in front of me. I was crawling to get away.”
“It was hitting the walls,” he said.
Nour crawled across the floor of the mosque to a window that had been broken by others as they fled and jumped trough it.
He jumped over a neighbouring wall. He ran around the block and he could still hear shooting.
Mohan Ibrahim described to the Herald running for his life to escape the gunman. He was one of 200 people in Christchurch’s Masjid Al Noor mosque when he heard shots being fired.
“At first we thought it was an electric shock but then all these people started running.”
He said there had been lots of people killed and many injured.
“I still have friends inside.
“I have been calling my friends but there are many I haven’t heard from. I am scared for my friends lives.”
He said there had been lots of people killed and many injured.
A man who took in people who escaped from the mosque has shared their description of the gunman.
He was white, aged in his 30s or 40s and wearing a uniform, but he had not been able to ascertain what the uniform was, Oakford Close resident Robert Weatherhead said.
“[They said] ‘he had a lot of magazines strapped to his legs’,” Weatherhead said.
A man who was in Al Noor Mosque during a shooting says it was absolutely full for noon prayers. He believed many have been killed.
A woman told the Christchurch Star she lay in her car near the mosque as four to five men came running towards her.
She was unsure if they were gunmen. Moments earlier she heard what she thought was gunfire.
“When the noise got louder I saw four or five men running. I put my seat down and lay down so they wouldn’t see me.
“I didn’t think I’d live to see this happening in my country,” she said.
A young man, who lives near Al Noor Mosque, said he was sleeping when he woke to 20-40 gun shots and a man running into his house with a bullet wound 3 inches into his leg.
The man with his three flatmates, who live on Brockworth Pl, called an ambulance and applied pressure on the victim’s leg.
The victim said he had just been at the mosque, multiple shots were fired and fled the scene immediately looking for assistant .
He said the victim didn’t see the armed gunman, but heard bullets ringing around.
He said that the victim told him he was almost shot in the stomach.
“I didn’t realise something of this magnitude could happen in New Zealand,” he said.
The ambulance never arrived so one of the flatmates drove the victim to hospital.
Second shooting at mosque in Linwood
A second shooting happened at a mosque in the Linwood area of the city.
One Friday prayer goer returned fire with a rifle or shotgun.
Witnesses said they heard multiple gunshots around 1.45pm.
A well known Muslim local chased the shooters and fired two shots at them as they sped off.
He was heard telling police officers he was firing in “self defence”.
“They were in a silver Subaru,” he told police.
Mark Nichols, manager of Premium Tyres and Auto in Linwood, said he a gunman ran past his shop around 45 minutes ago.
He heard five gunshots, and he believed the activity was centred around the nearby Linwood Masjid mosque.
He saw two injured people carried on stretchers past his shop. Both appeared to be alive.
“I seen a guy with a gun running up the road. He’s been firing about five shots, I think we heard,” Nichols said.
“It might have been a shotgun. I didn’t get a good luck at it, I just cleared off.
“Apparently there have been people in the mosque shot, and a police officer’s been shot too.
“It’s not very good, we’re in shutdown mode now. It’s all cordoned off.”
Christchurch resident Mandy Rooney was trapped in her car within metres of a mosque in Bishopdale.
She said she tried to get out of the car to see what was going on but was ordered back into her vehicle by armed police.
“They have their guns up and are walking around scoping through them,” she said.
“It is chaos. People have been trying to drive away and are just crashing into other vehicles.”
A witness told the Herald he had seen a body in a carpark at Papanui High School.
Papanui High School, which is north of where both incidents occurred, is in lockdown.
The receptionist said staff were hiding under their desks, and she could not comment on any activity nearby.
A man wearing military clothing has been arrested outside Papanui High School.
There is a large police presence at the hospital with many armed officers.
The New Zealand National Front has said it the events in Christchurch do not involve the organisation, nor its members.
“The National Front does not condone or agree with this type of wanton murder of innocent people regardless of their religious beliefs.
“We believe in freedom of speech and freedom to worship whatever god you chose.”
The University of Canterbury is in lock down. They say people are to stay inside until police give clearance.
Two Christchurch shopping malls are also in lockdown.
Shoppers and retail assistants at Westfield Riccarton and Northlands Mall are being told no one is allowed to leave.
The city centre is like a ghost town as police hunt the shooters.
Heavily armed police, including special units, are speeding around the empty streets with lights and sirens wailing.
Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel said her message to people is to stay away from the central city.
“If you are in the city please stay in the building you are in,” she said.
“All Council buildings are in lock down and they’re urging all central city building owners to do the same, until advised by the Police they can leave.”
‘I heard at least 20 [gunshots]’
Benjamin Jellie said he ran outside when he heard gunshots.
“I saw people jumping over the back fence of the mosque into Oakward Close. I heard at least 20 [gunshots].”
“I heard about eight at the start and then it went quiet for about 30 seconds or a minute and then it started again. I heard about eight more and then there was another minute and another eight,” Jellie said.
“Those coming over the fence, all adults and including at least three men, were screaming and crying.”
He believed the injured were all conscious.
The injured were very quiet, Jellie said.
The Bangladesh cricket team was at the mosque for Friday prayer when the shooting started.
A taxi driver in Deans Ave told Newstalk ZB that a jogger in the park said shots had been fired inside the mosque.
“Police and ambulance are coming from every direction”.
The public should not attend Christchurch Hospital unless it’s an emergency, a Canterbury DHB spokeswoman said.
“All appointments have been cancelled this afternoon, and no staff or patients are to enter or leave the building.”
Air New Zealand is offering flexibility to customers booked to fly to or from Christchurch today, in the wake of the shooting.
The airline will waive any fare change fees, should people need to make alternative travel arrangements.
Air New Zealand is also offering its support to Emergency Services managing the incident in Christchurch.

About 100,000 people from Honduras and Nepal have been granted the right to retain temporary protected status and remain in the United States for the time being under an agreement filed in federal court in San Francisco Tuesday.
The administration of President Donald Trump is seeking to end the temporary protected status for people from those countries and four others – El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti and Sudan.
The status is granted to people whose countries are undergoing upheavals from natural disasters or civil war. The Trump administration has said conditions in those countries are improving.
 
In October, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction allowing more than 300,000 people from the four other countries to remain in the United States while they challenge the termination. The U.S. Justice Department is now appealing that ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Representatives of Honduran and Nepali residents filed a similar lawsuit against the U.S. government in February. In an agreement signed by Chen on Tuesday, lawyers for both sides agreed to stay proceedings in the new lawsuit and allow the residents to remain in the United States until the appeal in the first case is resolved.
The groups represented in the second case include about 86,000 Hondurans and 15,000 Nepalis, according to the lawsuit.
Keshav Bhattarai, a lawsuit plaintiff from Nepal who lives in Sunnyvale, said the agreement “gives us all some breathing room to call on Congress to give us what we really need: permanent protection for TPS holders.”
Chen said in his preliminary injunction order that the plaintiffs in the first lawsuit had raised serious questions about whether the decision to terminate the protection was motivated by unconstitutional bias against non-white, non-European immigrants.

The Trump administration has agreed to temporarily halt the termination of humanitarian protections for more than 100,000 people from Honduras and Nepal, the American Civil Liberties Union announced Tuesday.
The decision comes exactly one month after the ACLU and other immigrant rights advocates filed a class-action lawsuit against the administration over its decision to end temporary protected status for immigrants from those two countries. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that the decision by the Department of Homeland Security to end TPS was “motivated by racial animus.”
Protections were due to end in June for 15,000 people from Nepal and next January for 86,000 people from Honduras, leaving them vulnerable to deportation.
The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on behalf of six immigrants with TPS and two U.S. citizens who are children of beneficiaries. TPS is a form of humanitarian relief granted to residents of countries devastated by natural disasters or war that allows beneficiaries to work legally while they remain in the U.S.
The program, created in 1990, applies to people from 10 countries. But the Trump administration has announced the termination of TPS for 98% of those who have it.
In October, a U.S. district judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked the administration from rescinding TPS for more than 300,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan while their case plays out in court. The administration is appealing that ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Trump administration canceled TPS for Honduras and Nepal after the first lawsuit was filed last year. Tuesday’s agreement essentially groups the fate of the two cases.
The case of Ramos vs. Nielsen alleges that government officials illegally diverged from how all previous administrations had interpreted TPS law, as part of a broad effort to decrease the number of nonwhite immigrants in the U.S. Lawyers representing the plaintiffs in Bhattarai vs. Nielsen, the case filed last month, made the same legal arguments.

Government lawyers said that those countries had sufficiently recovered from the original disasters, and that TPS was never meant to be permanent. A Department of Justice spokesman last month said the decision to terminate TPS for Honduras and Nepal was “both lawful and reasonable.”
Under the agreement, TPS will remain in place for Honduran and Nepalese immigrants at least until the appeal in the Ramos case is decided. Lawyer Ahilan Arulanantham with the ACLU of Southern California said that oral arguments with the 9th Circuit probably will be set for this summer, giving TPS beneficiaries several months of reprieve.
“I feel like I’ve been sick and this agreement is a few drops of medicine,” lead plaintiff Keshav Bhattarai, a TPS holder from Nepal who lives in Sunnyvale, near San Jose, said in a statement.
Also Tuesday, House Democrats unveiled a new version of the Dream Act, formally called the Dream and Promise Act, including a path to citizenship for beneficiaries of TPS. Arulanantham said immigrants with TPS, many of whom have lived in the U.S. for decades, deserve stability.
“Our lawsuit is not the solution to this — it’s temporary relief,” he said.

The small Nepalese community at UNK invited the Kearney community to learn more about their country.
The “Nepalese Student Association at Kearney” hosted its annual Nepali Night, offering traditional music, dance, and food.
Organizers say the nearly 20 Nepalese students would right now be celebrating the country’s Festival of Lights back home, so they say they’re celebrating together by creating a glimpse of that festival for Kearney.
“So just to share our culture like we’re not just Mount Everest or Sherpas or Gherkas,” said Nepalese Student Association at Kearney’s President Anup Khehet. “It really feels great since we’re a small community like doing this great event, it’s really important all of us members from our organization really work hard for it.”
Organizers say this will continue to be an annual event.

The bodies of two Icelandic mountaineers who died on an expedition in Nepal in 1988 have been discovered, mbl.is reports. Kristinn Rúnarsson and Þorsteinn Guðjónsson died on an expedition up Mount Pumori, 7,161m (23, 494ft), in October of 1988. The two climbers were 27 years old.
An American mountaineer came across the two bodies recently, discovering their nationality when he searched for their ID. “This is good and difficult news,” stated Anna Lára Friðriksdóttir, a friend of the deceased. She says the families of the two men held a memorial for them on November 26, 1988. “It would have been good for the parents to get to bury their children. It’s like when you lose someone at sea, there was just a memorial then[…]now it’s possible to close the case and that’s very good for their relatives.”
The expedition
Kristinn and Þorsteinn set off from London on September 17, 1988 to climb Mount Pumori. They were accompanied by Icelander Jón Geirsson and Stephen Aistrope, from Scotland. On October 2-3, the group set up base camp on Pumori around an elevation of 5,000m. On October 15, Jón left the expedition due to lung abscess. On October 17, Kristinn and Þorsteinn began their ascent from the base camp. Steve, who had come down with stomach flu, stayed behind. On October 18, Steve saw Kristinn and Þorsteinn through binoculars around an elevation of 6,600-6,700m before they disappeared from sight.
“They were good guys and great companions,” Jón said of the deceased in a recent interview. “They were ‘original’ and wanted to wear traditional Icelandic sweaters rather than the modern gear that most other people climbed in.” While reports of the young men’s disappearance in 1988 assumed they had died on their way up the mountain, Jón says it’s possible the two had reached the peak and were in fact on their way down. A climber from an Australian expedition reported seeing the two very close to the peak.
Ari Gunnarsson is the only Icelander known to have reached the peak of Pumori. He died on his descent in 1991 and his body has never been found.

Qatar a key to global labour market faced diplomatic crises with neighbours a couple of years back has now completely come to the position of self-reliance.
Coinciding with Qatar’s backdrop and magical self-reliance including various labour issues Lokaantar talked with him about the issues related to the bilateral diplomatic relation.
Here goes an edited excerpt of the interview:
What is Qatar’s take on four decades long diplomatic ties with Nepal?
I would say that the bilateral relations between the State of Qatar and Nepal have been developing well during these four decades, as the State of Qatar is keen to develop relations with Nepal in various fields through signing of agreements in various fields to strengthen cooperation in a formal way between our two governments.
We’ve achieved positive steps and aspire to realize more in order to further strengthen relations, we have important agreements we seek to sign, including the amendment of the labor agreement of 2005, the first labor agreement signed by Nepal with another country, and then the agreement on cooperation in the field of health as well as we seek to sign an agreement to protect investments. The two countries have high level of cooperation at the international forums and UN organizations arena through mutual support as well as our sharing the same views on global issues and adherence to international conventions.
How will Qatar as a friendly nation help Nepal achieve the goal of “Happy Nepali, Prosperous Nepal”? Is there any chance of Qatari investors investing in Nepal’s hydroelectricity, tourism and infrastructure development?
First of all, I would like to say that we are pleased with Nepal’s achievements at the political level since the CPA in 2006, the promulgation of the Constitution in 2015, the success of the general elections in 2017, and the achievement of political stability. We are ready to cooperate with Nepal in the field of agriculture, energy and other investments. We appreciate the efforts of the Government and the Investment Authority in the field of reform and the relevant of laws. We also seek to sign important agreements to enhance economic cooperation.
We are seeking to enhance cooperation between the two countries in various fields. I have been calling on Nepali business sectors to cooperate with Qatar in order to increase trade exchange and activate the joint chamber MoU by participating in various exhibitions in the State of Qatar and inviting Qatari companies to visit Nepal to explore investment opportunities.
Nepal is celebrating 2020 as Visit Nepal Year. What role will the embassy play in making Visit Nepal campaign successful? How will it inspire Qatari tourists to visit Nepal?
Visit Nepal 2020 campaign will be launched globally in January 2020 in various countries including Qatar. We welcome the campaign and the efforts to promote tourism in Nepal and we believe in the tremendous potential of Nepal in the field of tourism that is rarely available in any other country in the world, and there is a huge boom in the hospitality sector I would like to assure you that the number of Qatari tourists is constantly increasing compared to previous years, especially in the field of mountaineering. I would like to indicate that Nepal has an opportunity for medical and therapeutic tourism which should be well promoted in the Gulf countries.
Qatar is Nepali migrant laborers’ favorite destination country. How do you assess the condition of Nepali migrant workers in Qatar?
The State of Qatar has made tremendous steps in the field of labor during the last period, where it has amended the Labor Law and ended the sponsorship system, ensured the freedom for the worker to change the employer without the need to leave the country, made the official dealing with residence card and not the passport, obliged companies to deposit salaries through banks, formed a court in the Ministry of Labor to settle disputes, provide medical and recreational services to workers as well as other important and continuous steps within the framework of recognition of the role of Nepali workers in the State of Qatar.
Certainly there are problems in this sector, some of them because of illegal manpower offices and the problem of Azad visa and trafficking agents. We appreciate the role of the government and civil society organizations in confronting these challenges because we believe that migrant workers are important for the benefit of both countries and therefore their rights should be preserved and protected.We are seeking to amend and sign the bilateral labor agreement of 2005.There is a joint committee for that purpose.
The State of Qatar opened the Qatar Visa center QVC with the purpose of supporting migrant labor and we thank the Government of Nepal for its cooperation.
What is Qatar’s perspective on Nepali workers? Has Qatar developed any plans to create more jobs ahead?
I would like to emphasize that the Nepali workers enjoy the respect and appreciation of the leadership of the State and the Qatari people because of their integrity, sincerity and dedication and their reflection of the high ethics of Nepali nation.
The State of Qatar adopts Vision 2030 where it plans for other major projects and would like to continue this cooperation it’s our intention to carry on further after the FIFA world cup 2022.
How did Qatar achieve such enviable economic prosperity in such a short period? What is the secret of Qatar’s resilience in face of adversity from its neighbors in the form of blockade?
The top leadership of State of Qatar has a clear vision, which focused on the development and prosperity of the people, and supervised the elaboration of strategies and plans to the optimum use of national resources in cooperation with strong international partnerships, and attracted high expertise and skills in a number of fields.
I would like to indicate to the strong sense of unity among His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the ruling family and the Qatari people this led to intensive efforts by the Qatari citizen to promote the country into higher levels, therefore you find that the development of the State of Qatar is an ongoing process, this national unity that already exists is very useful for the country at the time of the blockade and it is known that during crises, national unity is the indispensable pillar to overcome obstacles, then the State of Qatar is oriented towards self-reliance. Consequently, in the year of the blockade it has become stronger and managed to produce many food products compared to its dependence on food imports in the past.
What are Qatar’s preparations for the Football World Cup 2022? Why do you think the western media portray Qatar in a poor light surrounding world cup preparations?
Most of the preparations have been completed and some stadiums have been officially opened and you know that the State of Qatar hosted the GCC Football Competition with the participation of all teams. His Highness the Amir welcomed all the spectators and participants from neighboring countries, and the Qatari people love football.
I would like to thank the Nepali workers for their cooperation in establishing sports facilities. What is sometimes mentioned in the Western media I think that it is not updated with the great developments that took place in the State of Qatar and I’ve referred to earlier which has been recognized by the competent international bodies such as the International Labor Organization, which has an office in the State of Qatar and we have joint initiatives and projects in this regard.
What is the probability of high-level visit of Qatari officials to Nepal?
The Embassy attaches great importance to high-level visits which is considered as one of the important steps in strengthening bilateral relations between the two countries. We are delighted and honored by the visit of Rt. Hon. Mrs. Bydia Devi Bhandari, President of the Republic of Nepal to the State of Qatar last November, which was fruitful and successful and will be followed by other visits. We will exert our efforts to have such visits from our side also, which push bilateral cooperation to broader horizons.
We have a joint working committee at the foreign ministry level to discuss political affairs, I assure you of the keenness of the State of Qatar to carry out such visits, which will develop bilateral cooperation to broader horizons.
To conclude, do you want to convey any message on the occasion of Qatar’s national day?
On the occasion of the National Day of the State of Qatar, I would like to extend my congratulations to His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Government and people of the State of Qatar, and I express my deepest greetings to the friendly people and Government of Nepal and wish to achieve their aspirations of development, prosperity and happiness.
I see this quite close as Nepal is already embarking on a process of change towards development compared to previous years. We are ready to talk, consult and actually cooperate, and always hope to see Nepal prosperous, safe and stable.

Last year, when Raju Basnet was covering landgrabs in the Nepali city of Lalitpur, he knew he was playing with fire. His reports in the weekly Khojtalas alleged that powerful people, including government officials, were involved in the scheme and Basnet had already received multiple warnings to back off the story. Despite this, Basnet told me when we met in his small, makeshift office on the edge of Kathmandu, he never thought he would be arrested.
However, the day after he republished another outlet’s story on the same issue on his website, authorities detained Basnet for five days under the Electronic Transactions Act, a law purportedly designed to fight cybercrime, but which journalists say is used against reporters who share news or commentary on social media and websites.
“The environment is not journalist friendly,” Basnet said. “The situation is critical now.”
It was a sentiment shared by many of the journalists with whom I met in Kathmandu in October. While they acknowledged that generally the climate had improved since restrictions imposed under the monarchy and later the Maoist insurgency in the 1990s and early 2000s, in the past two years authorities have chipped away at the guarantee of “complete press freedom” included in the new 2015 constitution.
The K.P. Sharma Oli-led Communist Party of Nepal government has proposed several pieces of legislation that undermine the rights laid out in the constitution. Three proposed bills—the Media Council Bill, which recommends reforms to the semi-autonomous Press Council; the Advertisement Regulation Bill, which would make publishers accountable for content in advertisements; and the Information Technology Bill—were flagged as having a negative impact on the press.
Alongside new regulations, journalists spoke of pressure from officials and embassies to censor reporting, reduced access and transparency, and caution when reporting on privately owned companies who provide a large part of the news industry’s advertising revenue.
“With the new constitution we thought we had protection, but again we have to fight for democracy,” Guna Raj Luitel, editor of the Nepali-language daily Nagarik, told me.
The government has argued that it needs the bills to deal with misinformation and hate speech, and to improve the media environment. But the general sentiment among the press is that these proposals are motivated by a desire to prevent criticism and dissent. Journalists told me that if the proposals were passed in their present form, it would be the greatest threat to journalism in the country in years.
“The government is trying to propose several acts that infringe upon the constitution,” Prakash Rimal, editor of the English-language daily The Himalayan Times, told me. “They walk different paths, all of which lead to the curtailing of press freedom … [and] will only encourage censorship or self-censorship.”
In a phone interview in late December, Nepal’s minister of communication and information technology, Gokul Baskota, said that the proposals were “based on the constitution” and that any suggestion they could be used against journalists was “fake.” Baskota said, “We have never made anti-freedom press laws.” He added that some provisions were created to tackle crimes on social media, not mainstream media.
Press freedom restricted
The curtailment of press freedom began in 2017, when the Constituent Assembly passed the criminal code. When it came into effect the following year, CPJ voiced alarm over provisions that threatened public interest journalism. A government-formed committee suggested amendments but those proposals have not been honored, said Govinda Acharya, president of the Federation of Nepali Journalists. The local press freedom advocacy group was included in the committee.
While nearly every journalist I spoke with said that the Press Council was in need of reform, most said the bill they were concerned about most was the Media Council Bill. The proposal, introduced to Parliament in May, would amend the Press Council and bring it under further government control, as well as giving it power to impose fines for damaging a person’s reputation. The bill was brought forward without stakeholder input, circumventing the typical process in a move that caused outcry from journalists across the country. The Federation of Nepali Journalists submitted a number of proposed amendments, which the government has said will be discussed at the next National Assembly session.
When we spoke in December, Baskota said the pieces of legislation were still being debated and were following the democratic process.
Under the Advertisement Regulation Bill, owners and publishers of media outlets could be held responsible for the contents of advertisements. The proposal includes stipulations for a fine of 10,000 Nepali rupees (US$90) and up to one year in jail for publishing content deemed offensive, false or confidential, according to the Himalayan Times.
Taranath Dahal, director of the local non-governmental organization Freedom Forum, said “I haven’t seen anything like this in a democratic country.” As of late December, the bill was with the National Assembly for approval, after the lower house endorsed it.
The Information Technology Bill would essentially repackage the existing Electronic Transactions Act, under which several journalists, including Basnet, were jailed. Nepal has faced major hacking incidents recently, so it does need a cyber-crime law, but not this kind, Babita Basnet, editor of the weekly Ghatana Ra Bichar, and no relation to Raju Basnet, told me over tea on a rainy afternoon.
Babita Basnet pointed to the case of Pranesh Gautam, a comedian who was jailed for nine days under the Electronic Transactions Act in June, for critiquing a film on “Meme Nepal,” his YouTube channel. “Before, even our brothers and sisters used to post jokes, criticizing the government. Now they’re not posting,” she said. “The fear is already there among the general people.”
Narayan Wagle, a senior journalist and former editor of the newspapers Kantipur and Nagarik, said, “If you allow police to interpret the act in their own way, the press will suffer.” Wagle added “The IT Bill will give police more authority, it equips them legally, making them more powerful so that the press behave.”
Numerous bills are being passed at provincial levels too, including the Radio Operation and Management Act of Province No. 1, which included provisions for imprisoning journalists for their work, before the Federation of Nepali Journalists lobbied successfully to have it removed, Acharya said.
Under pressure
Aside from restrictive legislation, editors in Kathmandu talked of how authorities and staff at some embassies applied pressure over stories that touched on transparency, development, or corruption. The editors said that while these phone calls were not overt threats, officials have called to ask questions about published reports and in some cases government supporters have called to criticize coverage.
Binod Dhungel, editor of the privately owned station Himalaya Television, and Babita Basnet both said that on average, they get calls once or twice a month. Rajesh KC, a cartoonist, said he also gets phone calls asking him why he is “anti-government.” He used to get similar calls during the king’s time and the Maoist conflict and said the motive was the same—the government does not want to be criticized.
Sanjeev Satgainya, a news editor at The Kathmandu Post, said that the government appeared to view any criticism as a ploy against it. “Anything critical is seen as destabilizing and a threat to democracy and the republican setup,” he said.
Anup Kaphle, editor of the English daily The Kathmandu Post, said staff in the Chinese embassy have called him and the publisher over coverage and that they were sensitive about stories on Tibet and the Dalai Lama.
Luitel, editor of Nagarik, said he had also received calls from staff at the Chinese embassy asking about the paper’s coverage on Hong Kong. Broadly speaking, Luitel said, the Nepali media shies away from issues considered sensitive in neighboring countries. “If you look at Kashmir or Tibet, it’s hardly touched,” he said. “Our government gets annoyed if we start reporting, we have been using wire stories.”
Nepal’s communication minister, Baskota denied there were attempts by the government to interfere with journalists.
China’s embassy in Nepal did not respond to CPJ’s request for comment.
There’s concern too about the influence of China and India on the Nepali government’s attitude toward the press, and the exporting of “Xi Jinping thought”—the Chinese president’s political philosophy that promotes the supremacy of the Communist Party. Deepak Adhikari, a freelance journalist, said the bills were a slide toward elected authoritarianism.
“[The government] praises Hun-Sen of Cambodia, they’re trying to be like China, when you hear things like that it’s worrying,” Kaphle, editor of The Kathmandu Post, said. “But they’ve also seen that it works … it’s working for Trump, it’s working for Erdoğan, it’s working for Modi.”
The journalists also talked about challenges in reporting on privately owned companies and businesses because of the risk of losing advertising revenue.
“We don’t do the digging that’s needed around the corporate world because they make such a big part of the advertisements and in Nepal the advertisement pie is really small,” Bhrikuti Rai, a reporter at The Kathmandu Post, said.
Luitel told me that if a news outlet reports critically on a company, the owners sometimes call the marketing department and withdraw advertising.
Ameet Dhakal, who runs Setopati, a news website funded entirely by advertising revenue, added, “I’m a little cautious not to kick too many doors at a time.”
CPJ/Aliya Iftikhar
Access denied
Diya Chand, editor of Sanchar Kendra, a small Nepali news website that often reports on the banned Communist Party of Nepal, led by Netra Bikram Chand, told me officials refused to renew her press card after she wrote about an incident in which police allegedly killed a member of the party. Officials told her they had been told to deny her request because she was creating problems for the government. After working with the Federation of Nepali Journalists, she was finally able to get the pass renewed.
“If we compare it to the conflict-era or insurgency, the situation is much better, but it seems the government wants journalists to write what the government wants,” Bimal Gautam, editor of the investigative website Lokaantar, told me. “Calls from different sources or officials, these are minor things, but the government is also trying to muffle dissenting opinions and trying to teach the principles of journalism.”
The government feels they’ve been written badly about, Rimal said, and is trying to enforce what it refers to as responsible journalism.
That’s certainly the line that Kishore Shrestha, the politically-appointed chair of the Press Council, appeared to be pushing when we met to discuss the current press freedom climate in Nepal. He began by saying, “The situation is still vulnerable. We have been given too much press freedom.”
The Press Council introduced a new code of conduct recently, which includes provisions to allow the council to monitor journalists’ social media accounts and take action against posts that it deems are not respectful.
Shrestha said the code of conduct was necessary because Nepal’s media did not have “quality control” and that the media should be “responsible and professional.” Shrestha said he has a duty not just to defend press freedom, but also readers who may have been victimized by journalists and hate speech.
The chair, who also works for the weekly tabloid Jana Aastha, said that he agreed with some of the criticism of the Electronic Transactions Act and the Media Council Bill, and that he would push for amendments.
Mohna Ansari, a lawyer and member of the independent National Human Rights Commission Nepal, said the code of conduct ascribed by the press council was hypocritical. “In the name of controlling hate speech, you can’t curtail freedom of expression,” she said.
Kosmos Biswokarma, editor of the news website Kathmandu Press, went further, describing it as “bullshit.” “Democracy doesn’t work like that,” he said. “Who gets to decide what responsible journalism is?”

The increasing incidents of rape, followed by the murder of the victim, have contributed to people raising voices for the death penalty of the culprit. Many citizens, politicians, and social activists have argued for hanging of the culprit till death. The horrific rape incident of a veterinary doctor in India and the rape incident of Nirmala Pant in Nepal has generated buzz for the demand of death penalty.
Death penalty is a debatable topic and the Nepali Constitution has explicitly abolished the capital punishment for any crime. Actually, death penalty is the highest form of punishment as it is an irrevocable sentence that takes the life of a human. There are many countries which still retain the provision of the death penalty but the number of convictions is very low.  The conviction under the death sentence is low as it violates human rights and there is no deterrent effect in society.
Death penalty is the violation of “due process of law”, “equal protection of law” and especially the prohibition against “cruel and unusual punishment.” It reduces the value of human life, respect for human life and also violates the offender’s right to life. Statistically, 58 countries still retain death penalty whereas 106 countries have abolished it holistically. Six countries have abolished it for ordinary crime and 32 have abolished it in practice. Countries like India, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China which cover 60 percent of the world’s population have retained the death penalty.
Capital punishment follows the retributive theory of justice which doesn’t allow the criminal to get a chance of rehabilitation and reformation. It is also observed throughout the world that death penalty is mostly declared to those groups of the society who are not able to afford expensive legal services. It boils down to people belonging to racial, ethnic and religious minority groups being meted out the death sentence. It is seldom awarded to a person from a socially and economically privileged background.
Also, death penalty encompasses the violation of basic human rights. Sometimes the state convicts the prisoners without affording them a fair trial. It denies the right to substantive due process, right to procedural due process and also the equality before the law.
International organisation like the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has analyzed that “capital punishment does not deter crime to a greater extent in comparison to the threat and application of the supposedly lesser punishment of life imprisonment.” Amnesty International stated that “the death penalty violates the most fundamental human right—the right to life. It is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment carried out in the name of justice.”
Since there is no deterrent effect of the death penalty in society, it is better to abolish the capital punishment and life imprisonment is preferable. There is no empirical proof of the death penalty having a deterrent effect (which is given as the major reason for not removing this punishment from the statute book) or vice versa. Thus, when there is no conclusive proof that it has a deterrent effect, peoples’ life should not be taken, unless such proof exists.
Before 1946, there was the provision of the death penalty in Nepal. But in that year, the death penalty was partially abolished for the ordinary crime. In 1985, it was reinstated for the offenses of homicides and terrorism. After that, in 1990, Nepal abolished the death penalty and de-constitutionalised the death penalty. In South Asia, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka have abolished capital punishment while, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Maldives have continued the practice.
The newly enacted Penal Offence (Punishment Determination and Implementation) Act, 2017 of Nepal which was implemented from August 17, 2018, has incorporated various new penal provisions such as community service, suspended sentence, reform homes, rehabilitation centres, open prisons, parole, probation etc.
Image credit: beinglibertarian.com
Section 13, of (Punishment Determination and Implementation) Penal Offence Act, 2017 explicitly prescribes that the purpose of punishment should be to deter the offender, rehabilitate the offender, and create a sense of remorse in the offender and so on. This suggests that the penal policy adopted by the criminal justice system of Nepal is of a reformative approach.
Also, the notable point is that Nepal is a signatory to a second optional protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which mandates the abolition of the death penalty. If we analyse the crime rate of countries where the death penalty is totally abolished and where the death penalty exists, we can observe that the crime rate of countries that abolished the death penalty is low. Thus, it cannot be conclusively said that the death penalty helps to control crime rate which by itself is enough reason to abolish it. Further, it also has drastic effects on not only the victim and his family but also on the way how society looks at and deals with crimes. There is no conclusive statistical evidence for the deterrent effect of the death penalty.
Since the judiciary in Nepal has such a large backlog of pending cases, it is safe to assume that the courts won’t be able to give as much time as they would have liked to in cases dealing with the death penalty where a person’s life is on balance. There is no point in realising the innocence of the victim after the execution. This places an extra burden on the courts to be careful in awarding capital punishment.
This is not to say that the punishment of the death penalty is itself justified. This can be illustrated through cases such as RV Crippen (England). In that case innocent Dr Crippen was hanged in haste due to lack of time in proper investigation. A 100 years after the execution it was proved that Crippen was innocent.
Courts attempt to pass verdicts on cases as soon as possible and due to this many innocent accused don’t get time to prove their innocence and lose their life. Thus, capital punishment should be abolished strictly. Imprisonment is better than the death sentence as a rehabilitated criminal can make a valuable contribution to society. Rehabilitation doesn’t only help those convicted of a crime and give them a chance to improve themselves. It also helps society in understanding the motives behind the crime and preventing society from such criminal acts.
Punishment is justified only if it is necessary as a means to some socially valid end. Long term imprisonment is sufficient as an invasion of individual liberty, privacy, and autonomy (and other fundamental values) to achieve valid social goals. Prisons serve as a better deterrent for crime as the fear of being deprived of liberty is greater than the fear of death.
There it is an erroneous belief that if criminals get hanged, families of murder victims feel relief. Instead, families of murder victims would be benefited by providing compensation, counselling and other assistance measures.

Kathmandu, 26 December (2019) – Umesh Sah, 40, of Rajbiraj Municipality in eastern Nepal has expressed dissatisfaction at his arrest.
Speaking at the press meet organised by Metropolitan Police Range on Thursday, Sah said that the police had arrested him for no reason.
He said, “I don’t know why we have been brought here. Why have you arbitrarily arrested us? The media has published our name for no reason.”
The police had arrested Sah in Saptari district and brought him to Kathmandu. During the press meet he requested the reporters to stop photographing him but they did not comply.
“What is the charge against me?” he asked.
The police asked him to keep silence. He then said, “I too am a mediaperson. Can the police arrest me just because my name was in the contact list on the cellphone?”
Pleading his innocence he said that the police had trapped him. He said lividly, “I should be allowed to put my side of the story.”

“Prove if I am a criminal,” he said after taking off his mask.
The police kept quiet all the time while Sah alleged them of arresting him without any reason. They took him to the holding cell shortly after the press meet.
The police had arranged the press meet to make public the persons alleged to be involved in human trafficking. A young woman was taken to Biratnagar to carry out Tantric ritual involving human sacrifice. The police has made public seven people including Sah alleging them of human trafficking.
Acting on the report filed at the Metropolitan Police Range by the young lady originally hailing from Dhading district, five policemen under the command of the Inspector were deployed from Kathmandu to Saptari district.
The police arrested Krishna Tamang of Kawasoti Hapsekot-1 Nawalparasi district, Umesh Sah of Rajbiraj Municiplaity-14 Saptari district, Dil Kumari Budha Magar of Ghorahi Municipality Dang district, Umesh Majhi of Saptakoshi Municipality-11 Saptari district, Dilip Poddar of Biratnagar Metropolitan City-8 Morang district, Prema Tamang of Khaniyabas Rural Municiplaity-2 Dhading district and Ranjit Kumar Chaudhary of Gadhi Rural Municipality-1 Sunsari district and brought them to Kathmandu.
The police said in the press meet that one shaman in a temple in Bihar, India had asked Dilip Poddar to find a woman to be sacrificed in the temple. The shaman had pledged to pay huge money to Poddar and even provided some advance payment to bring the woman.
According to the police, the accused group was taking the woman to Bihar for human sacrifice in pretext of making a documentary.

Forest is considered a great ornament of nature. The role of family forest in biodiversity conservation and generating income is vital. In contemporary context, promoting family forest plays an important role for conserving forest covers. In Nepal, nature has provided great wealth in the form of the forest and there is high potential of promoting family forest for conserving wildlife and ecosystem. It also helps to generate income and employment.
For a long period of time, countries have been preserving and promoting family forest for tourist attraction, wildlife conservation and for fun. Take the US. The Americans have given the responsibility of preserving and promoting family forest to the new generation and the term “generation for forest” is popular. The main objectives of this programme are managing home forest for income generation and to realise the importance of greenery and peace for the next generation.
The situation in Nepal, however, is different. Due to low income and lack of awareness among farmers, the importance of forest is not fully realised and recognised. But Nepali people have been preserving the forest from ancient times. The process of preserving forests is continuously gaining momentum.
If Forest Act 2018 is effectively implemented it will generate hope for farmers and uplift their life economically. According to Pitambar Sigdel, General Secretary at Association of Family Forest Owners Nepal (AFFON), the new Act regarding the forest has significantly increased hopes and enthusiasm among the farmers connected with family forest. In rural areas, people’s livelihood directly depends on the forest but due to the lack of effective policies and awareness farmers associated with home forest are unable to motivate and encourage new generation for preserving and managing family forest.
The major problem of farmers is that they are deprived of the benefit and advantage of utilising family forest. Nepal is rich in natural herbs and Ayurvedic herbs which can be economically beneficial to the locals. But due to lack of knowledge and guidance they are unable to take benefits from it. Most of the developed countries like the US, Canada and Denmark are highly preserving the family forest and farmers have benefited by utilising the forest. Unfortunately, in our country farmers have been unable to utilise the family forest for economic benefit.
According to the new Act, policy-specific priority has been given to the farmers who can utilise forest for their economic gains. The new law has made a provision for easy selling and utilisation of family forest for betterment of farmers and to lift them economically. So, farmers should be encouraged to cultivate plants that will grow faster so that they do not have to wait for a long time to get the economic benefit from the forest. According to the new Act, Nepal has given positive hope for providing security to family forest owners and increasing their access to local resources.

After the new policy of the government regarding forest in places like Butwal, farmers are excited about growing forest. As family forest contributes to conservation of biodiversity and can play a greater role to sequestrate carbon from the atmosphere. Similarly, family forest can generate income and employment opportunities; thereby helping in improvement of the livelihood of the people. So, it is very important to support the farmers, encourage them and provide necessary training so that they can effectively produce the forest and also be able to get the economic benefit from it.
Similarly, government should develop easy process for registering the family forest which must be done through the local ward office. It will help farmers to register without procedural hurdles. Further, all the required permissions related to harvest, use and transportation of the family forest product should be given by the ward offices. Family forest should be considered as agricultural crops and there should not be prohibition in cutting and selling of trees from family forest areas. Process for selling and cultivating trees can ensure economic benefit for the farmers.

Kathmandu, 29 December (2019) – Over the last few years, Nepal has turned into a “transit country” for drug trafficking.
Dinesh Amatya, DIGP, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), acknowledges that drug traffickers have made Nepal a transit point.
Speaking with the reporters last Sunday DIG Amatya said, “Expensive narcotics including cocaine are not used in Nepal. It is taken to foreign countries via Nepal.”
Last Wednesday the police arrested four foreign nationals with six kilograms of narcotics. These foreigners seem to have made Nepal a transit country.
Investigation by the NCB has shown that Alina Aldosaina, 18, and Pawel Vasileu of Belarus had come to Nepal to acquire cocaine on 18 December.
Brazilian Robert Carlos, 43, and Indian Rahul Jambrana, 54, had come to Nepal on 14 December from Brazil via Ethiopia and Delhi. They met Aldosaina and Vasileu at Lost Garden Hotel in Lazimpat, Kathmandu.
DIGP Amatya said that these vendors made a plan to traffic Cocaine to Hong Kong by putting it inside the false bottom of their jackets.
A special team of the bureau arrested Aldosaina and Vasileu at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) on Saturday while Carlos and Jambrana were arrested at Lost Garden Hotel based on the tip by Aldosaina.
On 17 January, Narcotics Control Bureau had arrested a Bolivian national Herera Artega Olga with three kilograms of cocaine at the TIA. He was hiding cocaine inside the false bottom of his jacket and had come to Nepal on a Fly Dubai flight.
Before that on 11 November the Bureau had arrested Brazilian national Sergio Turswaga with two kilograms of cocaine at the TIA. He had come here from Sao Paulo, Brazil via Doha, Qatar.
Nepal, thus, has become a transit point for drug peddlers. Because of lax laws and unrestricted movement in the airport, drug traffickers have been abusing Nepal’s international airport, said Basanta Lama, SSP and Spokesperson at NCB.
“Drug traffickers have been using countries that have abolished the death penalty as transit countries. They prefer Nepal because they will not face capital punishment even if they are caught,” DIG Amatya said.
Cocaine is hugely produced in South Africa. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico also produce cocaine. There is no demand for cocaine in Nepal.
SSP Lama said that the investigation has shown European countries, the US, Japan, China and other developed countries with high demand of cocaine.
“Drug trafficking is high in Nepal but the traffickers have been unsuccessful because of the Nepal Police action,” SSP Lama said.
Shailesh Thapa Chhetri, DIG and Spokesperson of the Nepal Police, said that NCB of the Nepal Police has been working with the international community to stop drug trafficking.

Kathmandu, 31 December (2019) – Sugarcane farmers from Sarlahi district in eastern Tarai have come to Kathmandu after being deprived of payments from the sugar mills.
These agitating farmers have met Minister of Agriculture Ghanshyam Bhusal and opposition party leader Gagan Thapa in vain.
Sugarcane farmers have been demonstrating at Maitighar Mandala which is at a stone’s throw from government secretariat Singh Durbar every day for the last two weeks. But there is no guarantee that they will get the payment they have been deprived of for the last five years.
The farmers say, “The government does not hear the voice of the farmers when they are alive. It may hear them after they have died.”
Raudi Mahato has come to Kathmandu from Sisautiya, Godaita Municipality in Sarlahi district. He told Lokantar, “No one hears our voice. I don’t know the minister. I am a simple farmer. I have come here because I heard that the government is nearby.”
Other farmers echo Raudi’s expression and say that they should get all due payments. Raudi Mahato has pasted a paper on his chest which reads, “Promptly pay the farmers.”
Sugar mill operators bought sugarcanes from the fields of the farmers but did not pay them for a long time. Mahato and other farmers have been agitating in Kathmandu cold to get those dues.
The whole day Mahato attends the sit-in at Maitighar and also goes to meet the political leaders. He goes to the rented room of his relative at night for the shelter.
He said that he did not have full stomach for the last few days due to the lack of money.
He said, “I don’t have any money. It’s been 15 days since I came to Kathmandu. I have taken shelter at a room of a villager. He is an old goods scavenger. I take a little food in the morning and attend the demonstration the whole day.”
Mahato has a wife, four sons and a daughter. Sugarcane farming is the main source of his earning.
He has only five katthas of land in his name. He has taken lease of two bigahas of land for sugarcane farming and has to pay the landlord. Sugar mill has not paid him any money so he has not been able to pay the landlord as well.
Annapurna Sugar Mill of Sarlahi district bought sugarcane from Mahato for the last four years but has not paid him any money. “I have to take around 400,000 rupees from the sugar mill. How can I pay the landlord in this situation?” Mahato asks.
Mahato says that he will not do sugarcane farming in others’ lands if the government facilitates farmers’ due payment. He says that even paddy farming has made his sustenance difficult.
“I have resolved to stay here till I get the payment, I may even die here,” Mahato told Lokantar. “The government may hear our voice while we are alive, otherwise it will hear us after we die. I am ready to sacrifice my life but will not go home without the payment.”
Pradeep Mukhiya of Basbariya Rural Municipality studies at the undergraduate level in Trichandra College. He has skipped classes and is participating in the agitation at Maitighar after his fellow villagers came to Kathmandu for due payment. He said that he had come to the demonstration because his father did not get due payments for sugarcane.
Mukhiya said that they have expressed their pain at the Ministry of Agriculture but have not received any concrete answer. “The minister eats rice, lentils and oil produced in our village, he may listen to us,” Mukhiya said with hope.
Annapurna Sugar Mill had made a written agreement with the farmers to pay all dues within September this year but failed to honour the agreement, Mukhiya said.
Around 25 sugarcanes farmers from Sarlahi district have been demonstrating at Maitighar Mandala for the last 15 days. These farmers are catching cold.

As Nepal prepares to fix a date for holding talks with India to resolve the border issue, the seriousness of resolve on Indian side and depth of the issue must be realized.
The history of demarcation of India-Nepal border began on March 4th, 1816, after the signing of the “Sugauli Treaty” between the then British India and the state of Nepal, which declares River Mahakali, of Nepal, as the border-line between both the countries. The Treaty was expected to resolve the border issues, but it did not. Even after such a long time, the dispute regarding the border and the no-man’s land area is being ensued now and then in different areas of Nepali border. The reason for the continuation of such dispute is that the rivers, counted on as border, diverged from their courses several times in the past. Interestingly, around 600 Km of the border is defined by rivers. Mechi in the East, Mahakali in the West and Naryani in the Susta area, and the unavailability of old maps and documents to revise demarcations has made the situation more significant. The Central government of India deputed its Para-military security guards of special services bureau (Shastra Seema Bal) along the border where as to counter guard the Nepali side of border-line, presence of Nepali security is almost nil!. Taking advantage of the ignorant attitude of Nepalese towards border guard, India started encroachment of the border land. She has said to encroach over 61,000 hectares in 26 of the bordering districts, by now. There has been a lot of hue and cry over the encroachment by Nepali people which unfortunately never fell on the deaf ears of the giant called India.
India surrounds Nepal from the East, West and South. There is a 1,808 km long border (September 2019 Wikipedia shows as 1,758 km)between Nepal and India, where out of 75 districts adjoining Indian territory,26 have been encroached, marking 71 areas of disputes altogether. The major ones include Kalapani- Limpiyahura, Susta, Mechi and Tanakpur. There is often found an opportunistic overtone in both countries regarding the ownership of such disputed border points. Hence, to resolve the issue, an India-Nepal Joint Technical Level Boundary Committee has been set up in motion which is still to find a reasonable solution for this false encroachment issue.
The encroachment by India started right after the Indo-Sino border war of November 1962. After facing defeat the Indian army set-up a camp inside Nepali’s territory at Kalapani to monitor the Chinese activities. But now they claim that the area belongs to them. However, reports prepared by Buddhi Narayan Shrestha, former director general of the Department of Survey Nepal, corroborates that the maps of 1850 and 1856 prepared by the Survey of India with the participation of Nepalese authority clearly states that the river originates from Limpiyadhura, 16 km North-West of Kalapani, which proves that Kalapani belongs to Nepal. But India refuses to accept those maps as proof. They say that the map prepared by them in 1875 should be considered as proof which shows river Mahakali origin is beyond Kalapani. Interestingly, the said map does not have Nepal’s certification.
The other disputed area situated in the East of Naryani River, is the Susta area, which is the tensest area owing to encroachment. Some time ago, over one thousand Indian villagers backed by Indian border police force (SSB) had forcibly entered the Nepali territory in Susta. They completely destroyed sugarcane in about ten hectares of land and also manhandled men and women. Where the locals of Susta complain such incidents are rampant in the area. The main reason behind the dispute is the changing course of Naryani River, over the past decades. The river has said to change its course towards the Nepalese side in the West. India has encroached about 14,500 hectares of the reclaimed land because of this. The intrusion happened in stages over a period of decades. According to reports, lands disputes among locals are usually won by Indian nationals who have the support of the armed Indian Border Police Force – the Seema Sashastra Bal. Considering the situation, the people of Nepal had launched a “save Susta campaign”. The organizers requested students of Nepal to join them and launch a valley wide campaign from Nepal’s capital Katmandu. The purpose of the campaign was to inform the world about the wicked plans of her “polite” neighbor India. Actually the reason to start off the border dispute at Susta side is that Susta is surrounded by Indian Territory on three sides -the North, South and East, and on the West it is the Naryani River. Hence, cutting off Susta from its mother land becomes much easier for India to occupy it which will pave her closer to the “Greater India” dream of Hindus.
The other most talked about point of dispute is Mechi. India’s disapproval of “Junge pillers” as the main boundary pillars has sparked the Mechi border dispute. The map published by the British India right after the Sauguli Treaty clearly indicates those pillars to be the main boundary pillars. Even history is evident that British had erected those pillars as monuments of Nepal-India border. But the credit goes to the Indian desire of getting control over weak and tiny neighbours which made her to incite the dispute by denying the original Sauguli Treaty signed by the British and the Nepal Kingdom.
According to the official records, Nepal covers a total area of 147,181 Sq Km. But in reality, the territory of Nepal is gradually shrinking because of the increasing encroachment by India. The Maoists Young Communist league (YCL) once submitted a memorandum to the Indian embassy Katmandu, demanding immediate return of the encroached land by the Indians in Susta area but later the political havoc in Nepal made everything go vanish for some time. They demanded that scientific demarcation of the border land must be done as per historical maps, the encroached territories should be given back to Nepal and the bilateral bordering area should be regulated. The district level of Nepal and India earlier agreed not to allow the use of encroached land for any purpose and put the issue at the central level for the resolution of the problem. But despite the agreement Indian farmers have been cultivating in the disputed area.

The Nepal-India joint Technical level Boundary Committee has supposed to have completed 97% of the task of strip-mapping the border, as per 1874 Persian map adopted by the committee. According to them all the disputes, except Susta and Kalapani, have been resolved. But when the border is traced in the field, many instances of encroachment are found. The unwisely decision of Nepalese side of accepting the Persian map as the basis of demarcation has made them deprived of 1630 hectares of their own land, which now lies in Indian territory. The border committee somehow, could not act the way it ought to. It failed to take firm decisions regarding border disputes at several places, such as the presence of Indian Paramilitary force in Kalapani since 1962.
India has many interests in Nepal to fulfill which it has gradually made her strong political, diplomatic, economic and cultural influence there, all due to RAW’s efforts. Her main strategy is to keep Nepal instable and always dependent towards India. In this regard, she has supported arms to the establishment as well as anti-establishment groups in Nepal, according to the former Prime Minister BP Koirala’s biography. India has a history for formulating efforts on multiple fronts to weaken the already fragile country to facilitate its swallowing. It is high time when all the Nepalese, currently divided among various political affiliations, should come together against the onslaught, instigated by India, in Nepalese territory and understand the game-plan of their hegemonic neighbor. And India also should realize that the flame she has ignited in Nepal can very well extend to its own northern flank and the unstable southern part as well. Keeping in mind the on-going protests in India on account of CAB and changed status of Kashmir and Ladakh, this possibility is too real and near both.

Zhou Li (not his real name) was glad he escaped Nepal before the big Christmas Eve police raid.
A couple of days before the Nepali cops detained 122 Chinese nationals Dec. 24 for suspected involvement in financial crimes, Zhou fled to China from an online gaming company where he worked for about two weeks in Katmandu, the Nepali capital.
The employer, whose name Zhou declined to disclose out of safety concerns, was not on the list for the raid, but it carries out the same deceptive scheme as those that were hit. These businesses are suspected of using social media to con wealthy single or divorced Chinese women out of money.
In an exclusive interview with Caixin, Zhou, from Yueyang in central China’s Hunan province, unveiled how an international fraud scheme played out.
Online chatting, air travel reimbursement, monthly salary of at least 10,000 yuan ($1,440) plus bonus. That was the offer that convinced Zhou, 23 and unemployed, and a friend to step on an airplane to Nepal. The friend said his relative worked at Amazon.com’s customer call center in Japan. Zhou said he thought the job in Nepal would be similar.
Upon arrival at Kathmandu airport, Zhou and his friend were picked up by a local contact and settled at a hotel tucked away in a secluded alley. According to the location Zhou provided, the hotel is close to Boudhanath Stupa, a popular tourist site on the northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu.
The company recently relocated from the Philippines because of tightened scrutiny by authorities. It leased more than 10 rooms from the hotel to house employees. Three to four employees shared a room, and there were many bugs in the rooms, Zhou said. The company used a vacant street-level retailing space at the hotel as its office.
Zhou was told employees had to be accompanied by designated personnel whenever they went outside the hotel for safety reasons.
On his first day at work, Zhou was given a used laptop computer, a used cell phone and a prepaid phone card. He was also given a training document, which he finished reading in about half an hour. The document taught new recruits how to compile a fake profile, introduce themselves and chat with women on dating websites.
Most often-picked professions include construction labor contractor, business partner, building material wholesaler and restaurant owner, Zhou said. They were instructed to target single or divorced women on Chinese dating websites and then lure them into spending money playing online gambling games designed by the company.
The employees were assigned different roles in the boiler room operation. Some were responsible for recruiting people from their hometowns; some screened potential clients on dating sites; and those who could type fast were assigned five targets a day. New recruits like Zhou were assigned two each day. Anyone who successfully attracted clients to spend money on the gambling games could get a 20% commission.
Zhou started his routine at 4 a.m. every day, including sending morning greetings to his targets. Usually he would tell them he just finished jogging or had a meeting to attend, to create an image of a successful and busy businessman. Around noon, he would text the targets asking them what they had for lunch.
The key strategy was to learn the targets’ interests and establish a bond with them, Zhou said. Some of his more skilled colleagues could chat with a dozen women online simultaneously. After gaining the targets’ trust, they would claim they had “inside information” and could help the targets win money in online gambling. After taking the bait, the players would win the first few games under the gaming company’s manipulation to lure them into betting more money.
Zhou heard that a colleague got a client to spend more than 800,000 yuan in two days. Most of the targets were women in their 40s and 50s who usually weren’t internet-savvy.
Southeast Asia bans drive companies to Nepal
Since the second half of 2019, many such online gambling companies, mostly operated by Chinese citizens, relocated to Nepal from Southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia and the Philippines, pushed out by a ban on online gambling by Cambodia and a halt in new licenses for online gaming in the Philippines.
Nepal has a relatively relaxed legal and business environment for casino and online gambling operators. The country also grants 90-day visas on arrival to Chinese citizens to attract foreign tourists, making it convenient for online gambling operators to recruit people from China.
Some local Chinese residents in Nepal told Caixin they noticed that many young Chinese men appeared in Kathmandu since September, claiming they were in e-commerce or internet businesses. They usually rented a big villa as their office and employee dormitory. Some local residents complained that these people drove up rents.
One of the main sites in December’s raid was an eight-story building on the northwest outskirts of Kathmandu. Local residents told Caixin that through windows they saw people working in front of computers. Not long before the arrest, the tenants spoke with the owner of a house across the street, offering 9,000 yuan a month, or four times the current rent.
The arrests were one of the biggest crackdowns on crime involving foreigners in the Himalayan country last year. But local residents said they think the raids hit only the tip of an iceberg. Nepali police said they are still closely monitoring about 800 suspected Chinese nationals.
“We could not catch most of them as they might have run away,” said Uttam Raj Subedi, chief of Nepal police in Kathmandu. “We are still on high alert.”
When Zhou told his boss his intention to quit, the company confiscated his passport and required that he pay back the flight ticket and his expenses in Nepal before returning it so he could leave. Zhou said he stole back his passport while others in the company were holding a party to welcome new recruits. He fled to the airport and took the cheapest flight back home, he said.

Shrubs and grasses are springing up around Mount Everest and across the Himalayas, one of the most rapidly heating regions of the planet.
The impact on water supplies of the small but significant increase in vegetation between the treeline and snowline is not yet known but could increase flooding in the vast Hindu Kush Himalayan region, which covers 4.2msq km(1.6m sq miles), feeds Asia’s 10 largest river systems and supplies 1.4 billion people with water.
Scientists used satellite data to identify increases in vegetation in the inaccessible subnival (the highest zone allowing plant growth) ecosystem, made up of grasses and dwarf shrubs with seasonal snow. This ecosystem is known but could play a crucial role in the region’s hydrology, covering between five and 15 times the area of permanent glaciers and snow in the region.
Studying images from 1993 to 2018 provided by Nasa’s Landsat satellites, researchers from Exeter University measured the spread of vegetation cover across four height brackets from 4,150 to 6,000 metres above sea level.
The melting of Himalayan glaciers has doubled since the turn of the century, with more than a quarter of all ice lost over the last four decades. Research has suggested that its ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate-induced shifts in vegetation.
“A lot of research has been done on ice melting in the Himalayan region, including a study that showed how the rate of ice loss doubled between 2000 and 2016,” said Dr Karen Anderson, of the Environment and Sustainability Institute on Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall.
“It’s important to monitor and understand ice loss in major mountain systems, but subnival ecosystems cover a much larger area than permanent snow and ice, and we know very little about them and how they moderate water supply.”
It is not yet known how more vegetation might affect water supplies but studies of increased vegetation in the Arctic found that they delivered a warming effect in the surrounding landscape, with the plants absorbing more light and warming the soil.
“That would be bad news for the Himalayas,” said Anderson. “The subnival zone is where seasonal snow is held and if it is warmer you will get flashy hydrology – quicker melt rates and an increased risk of flooding.”
But Anderson said that more vegetation may not actually increase warming and flood risks in the Himalayas, with the only study in the region, in Tibet, finding that the water in the plants that is evaporated through their leaf surface actually exerted a cooling influence.
“We really don’t know much about this area and we need to direct research attention towards it because it’s a major part of the water supply story in the Himalayas,” she added.
The study, published in Global Change Biology, was made possible by Google’s new Earth Engine, which provides researchers with a freely accessible collection of government agency satellite data in the cloud. Previously, researchers would have had to build a super-computer to sift through the enormous quantities of satellite data.
“It has really revolutionised this kind of work and enables large-scale, long time-series investigations like this to happen,” said Anderson.

Kathmandu, 9 January (2020) – Traffic police in crowded Kathmandu roads complain that they are forced to hold their urine for around five hours.
Traffic police officers have 10-hour shift each day. They carry out duties in two shifts and face the problem of peeing.
Lapse of concentration for even a minute can cause traffic havoc therefore a traffic officer doesn’t have the luxury of answering the call of nature, Police Personnel Lila Ram Thapa said. Holding on to their pee, traffic police personnel have to wave their hands and blow whistles.
Thapa directs traffic at Thamel-Galkopakha section. He said, “How can I pee? The traffic will be chaotic if I leave for even a second. On top of that, there is no proper place to pass urine. I pee in the morning before taking the shift and take a leak after the end of the shift. I hold urine during duty hours.”
Traffic police personnel Thapa told Lokantar that there is heavy traffic during rush hour (9 to 11 am) and he can’t leave duty for even a second. “Normally two traffic police personnel are deployed in an intersection but they can’t pee due to pressure of traffic management,” he said.
Traffic policeman Subas Tamang manages traffic in Balaju and he shares the same experience.
Kesharmahal chowk is the busiest stretch in Kathmandu. Around four traffic police personnel manage traffic there.
Moti Lal Kahdka manages traffic there. He said, “This road has the heaviest traffic. How can I take time off to pee?”
Senior nephrologist Dr. Rishi Kumar Kafle said that holding urine for a long time adversely impacts kidneys and leads to urine infection.
He said, “The government should build proper toilets keeping traffic police personnel’s health in mind.”
There is not even a proper toilet for traffic police personnel. Public toilets are very few in number. Traffic policemen say that they can’t use the toilet in people’s house or the hotel.
Traffic policeman Tamang said, “There are no public toilets here. Whose house do I enter to pee? There is no alternative to holding the urine.”
Traffic police has been strict in penalizing the defaulters of late. Policemen say that it is the reason why people don’t allow them to pee in their homes.
“Earlier we ignored ordinary traffic violations. But these days we take immediate action against violators. That is why people don’t allow us to use their toilets,” traffic police inspector Jitesh Dahal said.

Freedom of speech, of political and social activities and of association are central norms of a democratic society. And morality is the cornerstone of any government in the world.
But Nepal government seems be frequently flouting these ideals. Media Council and Information Technology bill introduced by the government contains provisions to curtail basic rights of freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution. Whereas the Criminal Code of the nation has adequate laws to take actions against anyone found guilty in case of violation of law, this bill intends to subdue the voice of the public which often pours in the social media to criticise untoward government actions.
Along with it, the Government of Nepal has registered Nepal Special Service Bill at the National Assembly. The bill has a clear provision of surveilling or intercepting an individual. Clause 10 of the bill clearly states that audio or visual conversation of an individual or an institution can be monitored. If this bill gets passed, then it is obvious that personal freedom will be sabotaged.
This is in keeping with the world trend. Throughout the world, most of the governments intend to disregard dissent. People have been unable to express their dissenting voices, especially on government policies. It needs to be emphasised here that dissent is the other word for freedom of thought.
However, expressing dissent has become a far cry in democratic countries like India. The recent Citizenship Amendment Bill and the oppression of the protesters, the brutal attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University students who have been protesting fee hikes in the university, mainstream media shamelessly parroting government’s voices serve as examples of populist government causing harm to democratic values.
The value of democracy persists in diverse opinions. And it is a necessary catalytic agent to which society owes its progress. Without dissent society becomes stagnant and moribund.
Governments disregard dissent and at the same time value Machiavellian character of deceiving the public. Niccolo Machiavelli in his magnum opus The Prince (1517) portrays some of the essential quality for a leader. Deceit is one of those qualities.
Machiavellianism is a term used to describe a person’s tendency to deceive and manipulate others for personal gain. In simple terms, Machiavellianism implies that in the arena of power, the end justifies the means. Machiavelli opines that for a politician, power is the most important thing, morality be damned.
To know how a modern Machiavellian would look like, we can present the example of the main character Francis Underwood from the American web series, The House of Cards. He uses double crosses, blackmail, political stratagem, ruthlessness, murder and manipulation of media. Nothing stops him to rise to the topmost political position. He not only eschews the value of morality with his fellow party members but even with his wife.
Throughout the 73 episodes, this web series depicts the fact that morality in present politics has been eclipsed for power. The fictional world eerily reflects the real world. The recent phenomenon seen in the present world politics is the Sabbath of morality. Whatever helps one to achieve morality is politics and whatever helps to achieve the end is moral. But the question remains, can a democratic norm endure in the absence of moral values?  If we believe morality a bedrock of democracy, it definitely will not.
The majority government of Nepal by now must have realised that power–even unchallenged power–is not enough. And personal popularity and charisma are not enough to govern a country. Thumping electoral victories are not enough. For had it been so, the country’s condition would not have been what it is today.
The most important thing for the government to run efficiently is the support of the general people. How much a politician needs the support of its people is described in every chapter of The Prince. Government accumulates support of the people with smooth delivery.
Meanwhile, in Nepal, a stark contrast can be found in the promise made by the government during the election and the reality afterwards. Dollar promised, penny delivered!
A situation has arisen in the country where on the one hand a myriad of problems are begging for solutions while on the other a medley of policies have become contentious.
However, the government is found indulging on the matters like extending the lease for Gokarna Forest Resort before the expiry of the current lease period which still has six more years. It is reported that the prime minister has a personal interest in doing so.

Prior to this, the government was forced to scrap ‘Guthi‘ bill. The bill tried to nationalise centuries-old religious trusts of Newar community and deprive them of ownership, culminating in cultural encroachment. The government had to scrap the bill due to public outcry and accusation of narrowing civil space and freedom.
These are few examples that depict the deceiving quality of the government towards the general public.
For Machiavelli deceit counts as one of the qualities of the leaders. He says, “Promise given was a necessity of the past and the word broken is the necessity of the present.”
The scribe feels that like most of the politicians in the world, Nepali politicos are anointed with Machiavellian thought when it comes to deceiving people.  They would better read Machiavelli’s treatise in full as he clearly says that if the leadership fails to recognize, trust, value and encourage its citizens it will quickly lose the respect and support from the people.
Sycophants and apologists of the current regime may paint a rosy picture but impartial people see a dismal picture of the country with hardly any relieving features in the present leadership.

When Ugra Karma made the first-ever Nepali metal recording, they didn’t intend to start a subculture. They just wanted to make life easier for themselves. “When we started to do shows,” says guitarist Prateek Raj Neupane, “our playing skills were at an amateur level. And the instruments we had were amateurish. And the sound didn’t come out good. We couldn’t explain what we wanted to sound engineers at shows, so we thought maybe we should do a record and give it to them so they could fix our sound. And that’s how we ended up recording the first-ever metal record in Nepal.”
That was in 2000 and the recording – the magnificently titled demo Himalayan Metal of Death, featuring a song called Perversion or Cutting Up of a Human Body & Eating Some of It – wasn’t made for general release. “We were thinking about bringing out three copies only, for the three people who recorded it. We would lend one to sound engineers at gigs. But our friends were adamant on us at least making 100 copies. We brought one of our friends’ father’s office printers to my home, made our own design and printed it.” The Nepali metal underground was born.
Back then, it was so underground that Ugra Karma, who were without a drummer, couldn’t even explain what death metal was to whoever filled in on the drum stool. “We would ask, ‘Do you play double bass drums?’” That’s the high-speed pummelling that powers death metal along. “They would tell us something like that didn’t even exist. So we switched instruments between songs. In one, I would do guitar and vocals, my friend would do bass, the other would do drums. But because we are not real drummers, we would get tired, so then I would go to drums and the other one would go to guitars. And then switch again.”
In truth, all metal in Nepal is still underground. This is one of the world’s poorest countries – ranked in the bottom quarter in the world for GDP per capita – and subject to political instability. The country was still recovering from a 10-year civil war that ended in 2006 when it was devastated by an earthquake in 2015. Corruption is endemic and the combination of denim, leather and long hair is still viewed with suspicion. Its music industry hasn’t the slightest interest in metal, which means everything has to be DIY.
For years, the police would pick up metal fans and cut off their long hair. Everyone mentions this as if it were a perfectly everyday thing. While that has stopped, the metal community still doesn’t have it easy: being a metalhead requires a level of commitment unknown in the west. “Recently, I was in jail for 15 days for putting on a thrash fest,” says Vishal Rai, who founded the Extreme Underground Metal Society of Nepal, which organises shows in the country. “Cops arrived in a van and said, ‘What kind of a noise is this?’ They took me in and charged me under noise pollution. I was kept inside for 15 days. This was a few months back. I am still on parole.”
This is the world in which the eighth edition of Silence festival exists. Nepal’s biggest metal event, established by Bikrant Shestra of the band Underside, is tiny by western standards: it takes place in two courtyards of a small hotel and restaurant complex in Kathmandu. But for Nepali metal, to have 1,500 or so fans in one place to watch a succession of bands across two stages one Saturday in mid-December is huge.
There are local groups – the excellent stoner rock trio Shree 3; Born in Silence, who owe such a debt (visually and sonically) to one particular band that they might as well be called KnotSlip; grindcore band Chepang, who have three singers, two drummers and no bassist; Prateek’s other death metal band, Binaash; and Underside themselves. There are bands from around Asia. And there is a big-name headliner: Californian thrash veterans Testament.
The day before Silence, though, there’s a sense of nervousness. It has been raining hard in Kathmandu, which means the site isn’t ready. Driving round the city, the surrounding mountains hidden from view by the lowering clouds and the traffic jostling on rutted and puddled roads, it’s hard to imagine how anyone could make a festival work here. And, as Underside’s singer Avishek KC explains, Nepal has a pay-on-the-day culture, and if the rain stays, the fans won’t come. What’s more, Testament’s fee alone accounts for more than the ticket revenue a sold-out event will bring, a situation made more worrying by the fact that one of the biggest sponsors has halved its funding. Worse still, Underside – the most popular metal band in Nepal – can’t even play their own festival: their drummer lives in Assam, in India, and can’t leave his girlfriend’s home because of the civil unrest there. There is gunfire outside the house and flights have been suspended.
Silence is clearly not going to make its organisers rich. Festival director Flower KC, who also manages Underside, reckons this one will lose £25,000, all covered by him and his friends. “The idea is guided by the idea that why should it be only mountaineers or hippies who come to Nepal?” Flower says. “Why can’t we attract a different breed of people? My goal is to make Nepal a heavy metal destination. Testament came to play purely because it was in Kathmandu – I hung out with them and they were stoked to be here.
“Fast forward 10 to 15 years, my dream is that our festival makes music fans want to travel to Nepal to see the sickest bands.” But he needs international sponsorship. “We don’t have infinite money, and sponsorship games are pretty weird in this country.”
While the people who run the festival might be middle-class by Nepali standards, they are not in western terms – all the Nepali metal musicians have other jobs. Prateek plays guitar in two bands, teaches leadership to management students in college, and acts in Nepali movies; Flower, who lives in the UK, works in local government in London.
Money matters here. “If you want to see real Nepal, you have to step out of the city,” Avishek says. “And people in the villages – until two years ago, you had all these power cut-offs, 18 hours a day without power. So people didn’t even have a choice to listen to music.” Prateek adds: “Working class here means something very different from England. They are so busy trying to get food and shelter for today that they do not have the luxury to come to gigs and listen to music and, in their terms, waste time.”
Being middle class, and having other avenues open to them, few metal bands last long – and fans don’t tend to stick with the scene far into their 20s. “They will regularly follow metal up to college,” says Vishal Rai. “But after college, they will get pressure from society and family to find a job. After college, they mostly follow a different lifestyle. But there are a few people who always stick to metal, like me. I’m very old to be into this stuff – I am 35.”
Having such a young scene is healthy in some ways, Prateek says. There are always young bands and fresh fans coming along. But because the scene is so young, no one has their own money, which means ticket prices have stayed low for 20 years, making it impossible for bands to even cover their costs.
“Make the tickets expensive,” he says. “Forget that 100 rupee [£1] bullshit. Make it 1,000. People need to learn that gigs are expensive. And there is a reason for that. If you hire a sound system, it will cost you. The venue will charge you. The venue gets paid, the sound system gets paid. But the bands – who are the core of the show, who the people come to see – aren’t paid.” Avishek notes that Underside, who can draw 800 people in Kathmandu, charged an unprecedented price for their last headline show: 500 rupees. A fiver, in British money.
Despite overnight storms, Saturday dawns clear. In the early morning, women are at the city’s wells, taking advantage of the good weather to get their washing done. Worshippers are making their clockwise walks around the roadside shrines that dot the city. And at the festival site, volunteers, having been unable to work the previous day, frantically pull everything together. Silence kicks off just a few minutes late and the crowd swells as the afternoon wears on. The majority of fans are local, with a few Europeans and Americans. One Peace Corps worker, who has come in from out of town, is sporting a T-shirt from the recent Extreme Gore Fest III event. When he went in the pit there, he says, everyone fled because he was twice their height and they thought he’d crush them.
The whole thing is fabulous: supremely good-natured and cooperative. There are local oddities: instead of the battle jackets – sleeveless denim covered with patches beloved of western metalheads – a fair few of the fans have sewn a big patch on to the back of a piece of entirely unmetal clothing. I see a Napalm Death patch on the back of a plaid shirt, though I’m not sure the lad who has attached a Pantera patch to the back of his waterproof has done its weather-resistant qualities any good. Best of all, Underside get their moment of glory after all. On learning of their drummer-less state, Testament’s Gene Hoglan – a legend in thrash metal – volunteers to spend the afternoon learning four songs so they can play a short set. Avishek is almost shaking with excitement when he tells me. “Gene Hoglan is going to play with Underside! Gene fucking Hoglan!”
After night falls, Testament take to the stage, the biggest metal band ever to have come to Nepal. Their singer, Chuck Billy, surveys the crowd. He’s played to thousands of audiences, most bigger than this, but I’ve rarely seen a man look so delighted to be fronting a band. “How are you fucking doing?” he shouts, then pauses to laugh. “Kathmandu?” And he shakes his head in disbelief.

Kathmandu, 13 January (2020) – Bishnu Lama, an alleged goon, has accused the police of firing at him two hours after the arrest.
The police had fired at Lama in Jammudada in Kathmandu district Sunday evening.
Lama told Lokantar that the police arrested him while he was sipping tea at a teashop in Buddha at 3:30 pm and shot at him at 5:30 pm. He claims that he was handcuffed at the time the police fired at him.
He is being treated at Trauma Centre in Kathmandu. Following is the edited version of his statement to Lokantar:
My house is near Medical College at Bouddha. I was drinking tea at a shop near my house with my friends when policemen in plainclothes arrested me.
The police took me around Bouddha area in their van. I was handcuffed.
I had been staying in India for the last six months and had come to Nepal after my relatives called me to settle the case of killing a child.
I thought that the case would settle soon when the police approached me.
The police took me to Jammudada at around 5:30 pm. Two policemen were talking there. One of them came up from behind and took me to trees behind police beat. They put my legs in between those trees and shot at the right leg.
I was stained in blood. Then they took me to Metropolitan Police Circle, Bouddha in their van. The policemen put me in another van and took me to the trauma centre.
There are reports that I threw stones at the police. But these are false reports.
The police, however, has denied claims that they shot at Lama after taking him into control. They maintain that Lama tried to run away and had to be shot at to take under control.
“Other absconding accused were with him. We were trying to nab them. Lama tried to run away and the police shot at him,” Ramesh Singh, DSP and Metropolitan Police Circle Chief, told Lokantar. DSP Singh said that the claim that police shot at Lama after taking under control is false.

Jail terms of up to five years could be imposed on people in Nepal who post “offensive” comment on social media sites, including Facebook and Instagram in the latest move by the government to crack down on dissent.
The information technology bill, introduced at the end of December, imposes fines of up to 1.5m rupees (about $13,000) for anyone posting content deemed to promote hate crime or ridicule. It would apply to all social networking sites.
Last month the ruling Nepal Communist party (NCP) also tabled a “special service bill” that would allow the National Investigation Department to collect information without a warrant or court order.
The information technology bill is expected to be debated by MPs this month. Critics fear it will pass with ease because the NCP holds a majority in parliament.
The Electronic Transaction Act (ETA), passed in 2008 to fight cybercrime, has already been used to restrict online comment. Critics say the new law will further curtail free speech.
Arjun Giri, an editor at the online news portal Tandav News, was detained for four days last April under the ETA after writing a story alleging fraud against a powerful local businessman that was shared on Facebook.
“I got a shocking call after a few days from the local police. Police took me into custody, citing that I violated the Electronic Transaction Act,” Giri said.
Other journalists and activists raised the alarm over his detention. “If media and journalists did not raise their voices for me I would have been in jail now,” he said. “This government is misusing its power and becoming a dictator.”
More recently the rapper Samir Ghising, also known as VTEN, was jailed for a week under the act for “antisocial, vulgar and derogatory language, and spreading the wrong message in society in his songs”.
Comedian Pranesh Gautam was jailed for nine days in June for critiquing a film on his YouTube channel.
According to Freedom Forum, 38 journalists were arrested, detained or questioned by police in 2019. Taranath Dahal, the forum’s director, said: “The situation is sinister. If the proposed bill becomes law, the media and journalist[s] will be the most targeted.
“We are living in the digital era and we will not be allowed to give our opinions, or speak and express our feelings, due to fear of a heavy fine and jail punishment, which will promote self-censorship. That means there will be no public debate.
But Kalyani Kumari Khadka, chairman of the development and technology committee, which introduced the legislation, said: “These clauses on the bill are extremely needed because our society is going out of control.”
Earlier attempts to restrict press freedoms met with protests that eventually forced the government to row back. But journalist and former newspaper editor Dhruba Hari Adhikary said the situation remained “very dangerous”.
“Both parliamentary bills, if allowed to become law, will adversely affect citizens’ constitutional rights relating to freedom of opinion and expression. The direct effect of [proposed] restrictive provisions will be on journalists, but the ultimate impact will be on people as a whole. Their right to be informed citizens of the country is being curbed for no fault of theirs.
“Constitutionally, Nepal is a democratic country, not a communist country like North Korea. So, the present ruling party cannot – and must not – be allowed to make laws which seek to dilute the norms and values cherished in a democratic society.”

There are people in this world who are calm, collected and easy-going.
And then there’s Dr. Peter Johnson, a gynecologic oncologist in Green Bay.
We first introduced him in October, just before he left for a two-month sabbatical at a Buddhist monastery in Nepal.
We met up with him again, now that he’s back home, as he says the experience not only changed him, but his staff and patients, too.
“The trip was really good. Certainly the Packers game on Sunday between the Seahawks and Packers… the third quarter got me back to where I was before any meditation, but by the end of the game, thank you Aaron, I got back to normal,” says Dr. Johnson, the director of gynecologic oncology at Aurora BayCare Medical Center in Green Bay.
His new normal exudes peace, compassion and gratitude for everything in his life and anyone around him.
“My nurses tell me I’m more behind in clinic every day because I’m spending more time with each patient, so yes, I think it does feel different to the patients as well, and it seems like people have opened up a whole lot more,” he says.
Dr. Johnson has been meditating for years, but spending a month in the Kopan Monastery, a formal Tibetan Buddhist retreat in Nepal, took him to a deeper level.
“You can remodel your life based on speech, based on your mind and your body,” he says. “Those three things. You mind those things, you could have a great life right there.”
As someone who wants to take away suffering for others, Dr. Johnson says transforming his thoughts and actions and focusing on being less stressed has a healing effect on his patients and their families.
In his two month trip, he also went through a physical transformation, losing weight from an all vegetarian diet and trekking through the rugged Himalayas.
“It was incredible. It was very brutal. Talk about steps… it was thousands,” says Dr. Johnson. “It was old trading routes, basically, that you walked down. The energy was beyond description. It was amazing.”
At the top, he experienced breathtaking views.
Dr. Johnson also visited a primitive hospital in the mountains, run by a nurse, and the university hospital in Kathmandu.
He’s now working to set up an exchange program for their doctors to visit Green Bay and for him to go back to Nepal and help there. It’s all about giving back.
“These are kids that are just starting out. Young doctors, just starting out… to be able to positively influence them, how awesome,” he says.
The whole experience gave him a new appreciation and understanding of how we all impact each other.
“Probably the most incredible thing was how happy people could be with so little,” he adds.

Janakpurdham, 19 January (2020) – On January 30, 2007 a protest rally starts from Bidyapati Chowk in Janakapur as part of the Madhesh movement. Rajesh Kumar Thakur, a ninth standard student at Sankatmochan School, participates in the rally.
The police opens fire at the crowd when it reaches Basahiya Chowk. Many people are wounded and the crowd scatters.
Rajesh was at the front of the crowd. He fell down on the spot. Protestors took him to Janakpur Zonal Hospital.
The hospital referred him to BP Koirala Health Science Institute, Dharan. He breathed his last after 12 hours of treatment.
Rajesh was the eldest son of Tapeshwar Thakur and Kusumi Devi hailing from Prakauli Village Development Committee in Mahottari district.
Without any lands to do agriculture, Tapeshwar came to Janakpur. He opened a hair salon at Janakpur Buspark to feed his family.
Rajesh was helping his father in the salon and studying in the school. But a bullet from the police took his life in his prime youth.
Government of Nepal declared him martyr and provided 100,000 rupees to his family. Kusumi Devi says that those who facilitated to provide that amount took away 50,000 rupees.
The family bought a house with 500,000 rupees. The remaining amount was spent on the wedding of Rajesh’s sister.
Their salon was brought down last year while expanding the road.
Rajesh’s father Tapeshwar died last year.
Now Rajesh’s brother Brikhesh shoulders the responsibility of feeding his family. He is working at another salon.
Brikhesh says, “I earn from 300 to 500 rupees a day and feed my mother, wife and children with it.”
Last year Lal Babu Raut, Chief Minister of Province-2, committed to provide government jobs to members of the martyr family while speaking at the Balidani Diwas (Sacrifice Day) in Lahan.
Raut had even given a contact paper to the martyr families. Brikhesh went to the Office of the Chief Minister (CM) with his mother and filled out the form for the job. But that led him nowhere.
“The CM has not called us as yet. I have no academic qualifications. I would be grateful to the province government if it appoints me to the post of a driver,” he said.
Madhesh-centric parties celebrate Balidani Diwas every day on 19 January. Kusumi Devi said that the leaders used to remember the families of the martyrs earlier but they have not paid attention afterwards.
Upendra Yadav who is credited for leading the Madhesh movement had met Rajesh’s parents in Janakpur and told them that his party would take responsibility for the whole family. But Kusumi Devi says that Yadav did not meet them afterwards. “No one asks how we are living and what the condition of our family is,” she says.
Rajesh’s story is an emblematic case of the state’s negligence of martyr families. Both the federal government and the provincial government have completely ignored the plights of the victims of Madhesh movement.
Even the political parties who led the victims during the movement have ditched them. Martyr family and family of the wounded have said that they have been unheeded.
